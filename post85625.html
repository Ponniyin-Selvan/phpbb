			<div class="content">please read full versions<br /><br /><br />Aihole Inscription of Pulikeshin II (634-635 CE)<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />(Verse.) Victorious is the holy Jinendra--he who is exempt <br />from old age, death and birth--in the sea of whose knowledge the <br />whole world is comprised like an island.<br />(V. 2.) And next, long victorious is the immeasurable, wide <br />ocean of the Chalukya family, which is the birth-place of jewels of <br />men that are ornaments of the diadem of the earth.<br />(V. 3.) And victorious for very long is Satyashraya, who in <br />bestowing gifts and honours on the brave and on the learned, both <br />together on either, observes not the rule of correspondency of <br />number.<br />(V. 4.) When many members of that race, bent on conquest, <br />applied to whom the title of Favourite of the Earth had at last <br />become appropriate, had passed away,-<br />(V. 5.) There was, of the Chalukya lineage, the king named <br />Jayasimha-vallabha, who in battle--where horses, footsoldiers and <br />elephants, bewildered, fell down under the strokes of many hundreds <br />of weapons, and where thousands of frightful headless trunks and of <br />flashes of rays of swords were leaping to and fro--by his bravery <br />made Fortune his own, even though she is suspected of fickleness.<br />(V. 6.) His son was be who was named Ranaraga, of divine <br />dignity, the one master of the world, whose superhuman nature, <br />(even) when he was asleep, people knew from the pre-eminence of his <br />form.<br />(V. 7.) His son was Polekeshin, who, though endowed with the <br />moon's Beauty, and though the favorite of Fortune, became the <br />bridegroom of Vatapipuri.<br />(V. 8.) Whose path in the pursuit of the three objects of <br />life the kings on earth even now are unable to follow; and bathed by <br />whom with the water of the purificatory rite, when he performed the <br />horse-sacrifice, the earth beamed with brightness.<br />(V. 9.) His son was Kirtivarman, the night of doom to the <br />Nalas, Mauryas and Kadambas, whose mind, although his thoughts kept <br />aloof from others' wives, was attracted by the Fortune of his <br />adversary.<br />(V. 10.) Who, having secured the fortune of victory by his <br />valour in war, being a scent-elephant of a king, of great strength, <br />at once completely broke down the multitude of the broad kadamba <br />trees--the Kadambas.<br />(V. 11.) When his desire was bent on the dominion of the <br />lord of the gods, his younger brother Mangalesha became king, who by <br />the sheets of dust of his army of horse, encamped on the shores of <br />the eastern and western seas, stretched an awning over the quarters.<br />(V. 12.) Who in that house which was the battle-field took <br />in marriage the damsel, the Fortune of the Katachchuris, having <br />scattered the gathering gloom, (viz.) the array of elephants (of the <br />adversary), with hundreds of bright-rayed lamps, (viz.) the swords <br />(of his followers).<br />(V. 13) And again, when he was desirous of taking the island <br />of Revati, his great army with many bright banners, which had <br />ascended the ramparts, as it was reflected in the water of the sea <br />appeared like Varuna's forces, quickly come there at once at his <br />word (of command).<br />(V. 14.) When his elder brother's son, named Polekeshin, of <br />a dignity like Nahusha's, was coveted by Fortune, and finding his <br />uncle to be jealous of him thereat, had formed the resolution to <br />wander abroad as an exile,-<br />(V. 15.) That Mangalesha, whose great strength became on all <br />sides reduced by the application of the powers of good counsel and <br />energy gathered by Him, abandoned, together with the effort to <br />secure the kingdom for his own son, both that no mean kingdom of his <br />and his life.<br />(V. 16.) Then, on the subversion of that rule encompassed by <br />the darkness of enemies, the whole world grew light again, invaded <br />as it were by the lustrous rays of His irresistible splendour. Or <br />when was it that the sky ceased to be black like a swarm of bees <br />with thundering clouds, in which flashes of lightning were dancing <br />like banners, and the edges of which were crushed in the rushing <br />wind?<br />(V. 17.) When, having found the opportunity, he who was <br />named Appayika, and Govinda approached with their troops of <br />elephants to conquer the country north of the Bhaimarathi, the one <br />in battle through His armies came to know the taste of fear, while <br />the other at once received the reward of the services rendered by <br />him.<br />(V. 18.) When He was besieging Vanavasi, which for a girdle <br />has the rows of hamsa birds that sport on the high waves of the <br />Varada as their play-place, and which by its wealth rivalled the <br />city of the gods, that fortress on land, having the surface of the <br />earth all around covered with the great sea of his army, to the <br />looker-on seemed at once converted into a fortress in the water.<br />(V. 19.) Although in former days they had acquired happiness <br />by renouncing the seven sins, the Ganga and Alupa lords, being <br />subdued by His dignity, were always intoxicated by drinking the <br />nectar of close attendance upon him.<br />(V. 20.) In the Konkanas the impetuous waves of the forces <br />directed by Him speedily swept away the rising wavelets of pools-the <br />Mauryas.<br />(V. 21.) When, radiant like the destroyer of Pura, He <br />besieged Puri, the Fortune of the western sea, with hundreds of <br />ships in appearance like arrays of rutting elephants, the sky, dark-<br />blue as a young lotus and covered with tiers of massive clouds, <br />resembled the sea, and the sea was like the sky.<br />(V. 22.) Subdued by His splendour, the Latas, Malavas and <br />Gurjaras became as it were teachers of how feudatories, subdued by <br />force, ought to behave.<br />(V. 23.) Harsha, whose lotus-feet were arrayed with the rays <br />of the jewels of the diadems of hosts of feudatories prosperous with <br />unmeasured might, through Him had his mirth (harsha) melted away by <br />fear, having become loathsome with his rows of lordly elephants <br />fallen in battle.<br />(V. 24.) While He was ruling the earth with his broad <br />armies, the neighbourhood of the Vindhya., by no means destitute of <br />the lustre of the many sandbanks of the Reva, shone even more <br />brightly by his great personal splendour, having to be avoided by <br />his elephants because, as it seemed, they by their bulk rivalled the <br />mountains.<br />(V. 25.) Almost equal to Indra, He by means of all the three <br />powers, gathered by him according to rule, and by his noble birth <br />and other excellent qualities, acquired the sovereignty over the <br />three Maharashtrakas with their nine and ninety thousand villages.<br />(V. 26.) Through the excellencies of their householders <br />prominent in the pursuit of the three objects of life, and having <br />broken the pride of other rulers of the earth, the Kalingas with the <br />Kosalas by His army were made to evince signs of fear.<br />(V. 27.) Hard pressed (pishta) by Him, Pishtapura became a <br />fortress not difficult of access; wonderful (to relate), the ways of <br />the Kali age to Him were quite inaccessible!<br />(V. 28.) Ravaged by Him, the water of Kunala--coloured with <br />the blood of men killed with many weapons, and the land within it <br />overspread with arrays of accoutred elephants--was like the cloud-<br />covered sky in which the red evening-twilight has risen.<br />(V. 29.) With his sixfold forces, the hereditary troops and <br />the rest, who raised spotless chowries, hundreds of flags, <br />umbrellas, and darkness, and who churned the enemy elated with the <br />sentiments of heroism and energy, He caused the splendour of the <br />lord of the Pallavas, who had opposed the rise of his power, to be <br />obscured by the dust of his army, and to vanish behind the walls of <br />Kanchipura.<br />(V. 30.) When straightway He strove to conquer the Cholas, <br />the Kaveri, who has the darting carps for her tremulous eyes, had <br />her current obstructed by the causeway formed by his elephants whose <br />rutting-juice was dripping down, and avoided the contact with the <br />ocean.<br />(V. 31.) There He caused great prosperity to the Cholas, <br />Keralas and Pandyas, he being the hot-rayed son to the hoar-frost--<br />the army of the Pallavas.<br />(V. 32.) While He, Satyashraya, endowed with the powers of <br />energy, mastery and good counsel,--having conquered all the <br />quarters, having dismissed the kings full of honours, having done <br />homage to gods and Brahmans, having entered the city of Vatapi--is <br />ruling, like one city, this earth which has the dark-blue waters of <br />the surging sea for its moat;<br />(V. 33.) (Now) when thirty (and) three thousand and five <br />years besides, joined with seven hundred years, have passed since <br />the Bharata war;<br />(V. 34.) And when fifty (and) six and five hundred years of <br />the Saka kings also have gone by in the Kali age;<br />(V. 35.) This stone mansion of Jinendra, a mansion of every <br />kind of greatness, has been caused to be built by the wise <br />Ravikirti, who has obtained the highest favour of that Satyashraya <br />whose rule is bounded by the three oceans.<br />(V. 36.) Of this eulogy and of this dwelling of the Jina <br />revered in the three worlds, the wise Ravikirti himself is the <br />author and also the founder.<br />(V. 37.) May that Ravikirti be victorious, who full of <br />discernment has used the abode of the Jina, firmly built of stone, <br />for a new treatment of his theme, and who thus by his poetic skill <br />has attained to the fame of Kalidasa and of Bharavi!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />From: Epigraphia Indica, Vol. VI.
