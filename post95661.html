My full appreciation to their<br />  efforts. What I&#39;d like to present is an alternative.<br /> <br />  * Pavitra says Serial novels &#40;thodarkathai&#41; suffer from some form of<br />  inconsistency and that Kalki did&#39;nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />  nandini&#39;s<br />  father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not<br />true !<br />  Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not<br />  only in the<br />  first part &#40;Pudhu vellam&#41;<br />  &#40;Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan&#41; but even also in the fourth part !<br />  Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears<br />before<br />  nandhini -<br />  and she exclaims and talks in<br />  hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....and<br />  so on ...".<br />  In fact if you carefully read<br />  the novel, you&#39;ll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />  Pandiyan she<br />  always says that he is her lover -<br />  Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!<br /> <br />  * There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when she<br />  has her<br />  final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />  Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />  Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />  Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />  conversation and<br />  heard that she was mentioning the<br />  name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide<br />this fact<br />  directly during Nandhini&#39;s final<br />  dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think there<br />  is a very<br />  very definite purpose and<br />  I&#39;ll try to answer this question in another mail &#40;Kindly ref my last<br />  lines in<br />  this mail&#41;<br /> <br />  * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />  throughout the<br />  Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />  indeed Nandhini&#39;s Lover.<br /> <br />  * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini&#39;s<br />  father come<br />  from Karuthiruman. But please<br />  remember<br />  - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point of<br />  time he<br />  says he fathered nandhini!<br />  - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to<br />pandiyas.<br />  - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />  Vandhiyathevan, that<br />  too during a time pass chat !<br />  Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />  - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow<br />is more<br />  dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets<br />the<br />  eye &#40; I<br />  plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future<br />&#41;.<br /> <br />  * In the conclusion &#40;mudivurai&#41; he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> &#40; I don&#39;t know<br />whether<br />  all of<br />  you have read the conclusion. It is<br />  very important for the novel as a whole&#41;, Kalki says :<br />  "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to<br />Arulmozhi..."<br />  If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />  Vandhiyathevan<br />  he need not have written these lines<br />  at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers -<br />he<br />  had many<br />  more ideas about the characters them<br />  selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further<br />!<br /> <br />  Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />  PANDIYAN<br />  ?????<br /> <br />  I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />  Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.<br /> <br />  Cheers !<br />  Gokul</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Find out what India is talking about on - Yahoo!

Welcome !....<br />and<br />    so on ...".<br />    In fact if you carefully read<br />    the novel, you&#39;ll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />    Pandiyan she<br />    always says that he is her lover -<br />    Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!<br />   <br />    * There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when<br />she<br />    has her<br />    final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />    Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />    Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />    Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />    conversation and<br />    heard that she was mentioning the<br />    name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide<br />  this fact<br />    directly during Nandhini&#39;s final<br />    dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think<br />there<br />    is a very<br />    very definite purpose and<br />    I&#39;ll try to answer this question in another mail &#40;Kindly ref my<br />last<br />    lines in<br />    this mail&#41;<br />   <br />    * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />    throughout the<br />    Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />    indeed Nandhini&#39;s Lover.<br />   <br />    * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is<br />Nandhini&#39;s<br />    father come<br />    from Karuthiruman. But please<br />    remember<br />    - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point<br />of<br />    time he<br />    says he fathered nandhini!<br />    - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to<br />  pandiyas.<br />    - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />    Vandhiyathevan, that<br />    too during a time pass chat !<br />    Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />    - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow<br />  is more<br />    dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets<br />  the<br />    eye &#40; I<br />    plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the<br />future<br />  &#41;.<br />   <br />    * In the conclusion &#40;mudivurai&#41; he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> &#40; I don&#39;t know<br />  whether<br />    all of<br />    you have read the conclusion. It is<br />    very important for the novel as a whole&#41;, Kalki says :<br />    "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to<br />  Arulmozhi..."<br />    If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />    Vandhiyathevan<br />    he need not have written these lines<br />    at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers -<br />  he<br />    had many<br />    more ideas about the characters them<br />    selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even<br />further<br />  !<br />   <br />    Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT<br />VEERA<br />    PANDIYAN<br />    ?????<br />   <br />    I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />    Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.<br />   <br />    Cheers !<br />    Gokul<br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  Find out what India is talking about on - Yahoo!

			<div class="content">hi<br /><br />A. Please refer to Karuthiruman Kathai chapter (part 5).<br />According to the statement made by him the following can be summarised:<br /><br />1. That he saved Mandakini from lighthouse of Kodiakkari.<br /><br />2. He met possibly Aniruddha and his men ( a statement corroborated by<br />Sundara Chola as he sent in his minister & friend to search for her).<br /><br />3. He took her to a nearby island for money. She did not recognise even<br />her father as she was having amnesia. At the same time he also gives a<br />lift to man, who turned out to be the Pandyan king. What was he doing in<br />mid sea? Why he went to Kodiakkarai? If at he wanted to go to Lanka he<br />could have easily crossed the sea at Ramesvaram? Only Kalki can answer<br />this strange coincidence.<br /><br />4. Karuthiruman leaves Veerapandya, the girl with amnesia (or mentally<br />unsound) and goes on to meet the Lankan king. Within few days<br />Veerapandya joins Karuthiruman at the court of Lankan king. Pandyan king<br />offers gold to him for the girl at Bhutathivu.<br /><br />5. Karuthiruman meets her again within few days at Kodiakkari. Her<br />father had already died.<br /><br />6. She regains her memory. She is found to be pregnant. She delivers the<br />twins - Nandhini and Old Madurantakan.<br /><br />7. So when did she become pregnant? BY the Pandyan king when she was not<br />in her senses? If so, Veerapandyan got the deserving punishment at the<br />hands of Aditya.<br /><br />8. She could not have become a mother due to Karuthiruman as he left<br />immediately after dropping her at Bhutativu.<br /><br />B.In the chapter 62 Etti Painthathu<br /><br />1. OId Mathurantakan enquires about his father, fearing that he may<br />claim the right. But Karuthiruman, informs him that he is a Rajakumaran<br />and he himself is the servant of his father - obviously Veerapandyan. he<br />was pleasantly surprised after having informed he is not the rightful<br />heir to Chola throne.<br /><br />2. In the Chapter 64 Unnmaiyai Chol, Alwakadiyan extracts some<br />information from Karuthiruman.<br /><br />C. In Chapter 90 Ponmazhai Pozhinthatu, in the long conversation between<br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VVD</acronym> and Kundavai, she expresses a doubt over this issue - Veerapandyan<br />being the father of Nandini. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VVD</acronym> confirms that the name was uttered by<br />Nandini, hence Paluvettaraiyar got angry with her. Again Kundavai<br />express a doubt whether a lady could call her father a lover?. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VVD</acronym><br />substantiates that it is the character of Nandhini and the situation<br />warranted as Aditya was so hot headed at that time.<br /><br />What all this means?<br /><br />1. Kalki wanted this issue to be live and unsettles one right through<br />like the secret about the actual assassin of Aditya. These two are the<br />core issues of the whole story and all the events leads to it until he<br />changes the track and pleased at the sacrifice of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>. Perhaps a later<br />thought.<br /><br />2. Perhaps he introduced the character Karuthiruman only to confuse this<br />issue. He suggests that Mandakini became pregnant when she was not in<br />her senses. Both Veerapandya and Karuthiruman hardly spent few days with<br />her. How could they all be the father of her children?<br /><br />3. In fact Kalki, being the master story teller, he wanted to highlight<br />the spoilt mind of Nandhini due to her lonely childhood and the insults<br />heaped at her. Nandhini must have developed a complex (can any<br />Psychologist name it), where she wanted to become a prince/queen. She<br />must have been afraid about her parentage so she tried to unknot the<br />secret. Perhaps by establishing her royal lineage she will be on<br />stronger ground to fight Kundavai. Therefore she repeatedly believed or<br />rather prayed Veerapandya was her father.<br /><br />4. So Kalki wanted all of us to keep guessing. Even Nadhini was not so<br />sure, when she told what she believed to the truth to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /><br />As I said it is best kept secret of the novel. A prerogative of any<br />story teller is to leave loose ends. A tightly written story becomes<br />history, not a historical novel. Kalki is not writing history for that<br />matter. He drew a firm line as an historical novel writer and historian.<br />His post script proves it.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sriraman.p.s</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by vinu ganesh  using id kvinuganesh</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear all<br /><br />I wish to one point about nandhini. As per my view nandhini had gread affection with her mother<br />when she hear about her mother story she decided to kill both veerapandya( because he raped uumai nachiar ) and sundara cholan( because he left her mother) <br /><br />Because once adithya discussed with vandya devan, he tells that he was not at all decided to kill<br />VP when nandhini told him that he was her lover leave him., then only he got angry and<br />killed VP. and he also told to vandya devan that it is also one of the drama of nandhini<br />to kill veerapandya<br /><br />regds<br />vinu<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Thursday, 12 October, 2006 9:43:08 AM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: NanDini!!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />    <br />            <br />Hi Gokul,<br />   <br />Thanks for the input. I am of the opinion, that Nandhini's father could be of pandya origin or relations.. for that matter even cholas are related Pandyas and chera, so its an maaman-machan sandai.. or is it could a dowry problem?<br />   <br />Amarabhujan cannot make a claim to the pandya throne with pandya abathuthaviyagal. . <br />   <br />Nandhini is also called "Amma" by Veera pandiyan's son.. the pandya heir... so there is no chance that Nandhini is veera pandiyan 's daughter.<br />   <br />Regards<br />Nanda<br />  <br />"S.Gokul"  wrote:<br />Message No 188 from archives reproduced:<br /><br />Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father<br /><br />Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into Nandhini's<br />parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.<br /><br />* Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form of<br />inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />nandini's<br />father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not true !<br />Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not<br />only in the<br />first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />(Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears before<br />nandhini -<br />and she exclaims and talks in<br />hallucination like this<br />" Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....and<br />so on ...".<br />In fact if you carefully read<br />the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />Pandiyan she<br />always says that he is her lover -<br />Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!<br /><br />* There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when she<br />has her<br />final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is.......... ......."<br />Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />conversation and<br />heard that she was mentioning the<br />name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide this fact<br />directly during Nandhini's final<br />dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think there<br />is a very<br />very definite purpose and<br />I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my last<br />lines in<br />this<br />mail)<br /><br />* Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />throughout the<br />Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />indeed Nandhini's Lover.<br /><br />* The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's<br />father come<br />from Karuthiruman. But please<br />remember<br />- Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point of<br />time he<br />says he fathered nandhini!<br />- This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to pandiyas.<br />- There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />Vandhiyathevan, that<br />too during a time pass chat !<br />Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />- Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow is more<br />dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets the<br />eye ( I<br />plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future).<br /><br />* In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> ( I don't know whether<br />all of<br />you<br />have read the conclusion. It is<br />very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />"Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to Arulmozhi... "<br />If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />Vandhiyathevan<br />he need not have written these lines<br />at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - he<br />had many<br />more ideas about the characters them<br />selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further !<br /><br />Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />PANDIYAN<br />?????<br /><br />I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.<br /><br />Cheers !<br />Gokul<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />	<br /><br />	<br />		<br /> <br />Find out what India is talking about on - Yahoo!

			<div class="content">hi venkat<br /><br />i am not a student of law. as said earlier a keen student of common<br />snese (or with common sense?). i leave it to you.<br /><br />clarfy the following points as i do not have the copies of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> now on<br />hand.<br /><br />1. Who is the mother of young Pandyan king?<br /><br />2. why he was just introduced for a flash moment in the novel by Kalki?<br />T0 me he did so to keep the mometum in the serial (repeat serial novel).<br />he needed a fulcrum on which the apathudavis can take a vow. there no<br />point in just taking revenge. there must be a cause for revenge. that is<br />hindu dharma. so the author introduced a child, every one gain sympathy<br />in the cause for revenge . even some sane voice will accept that Nadhini<br />is correct in planning to kill Aditya, the focul point of the story at<br />that time.<br /><br />3. when old Mathurantakan becomes a contender, he too must have been<br />roped in by Ravidasan as he would be very happy play with two spades A.<br />Modern management is all about Plan B. So the two contendenter are<br />mutual Plan B in ravidasan's scheme. So Kalki allowed it be so and also<br />to stand by the historical facts of war of succession to the Pandyan's<br />throne . Am I correct?<br /><br />4.May I add another point. nandhini was created just to add support to<br />Kundavai character. In a plot where there is real no hero/heroine Vs<br />Villain, when a plot focus on more around situations rather than<br />characters, it imperative to create pairs of characters.<br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VVD</acronym>-Alwarkadiyan, Aditya-Rajaraja, Kundavai & her shadow Vanadi-<br />Nandhini, Aniruddha-Paluvettaraiyar, Pathibendran-Kandamaran, many<br />opposing minor characters. If you write a story with just Kundavai and<br />her shadow Vanadi, it will be a drab Kundavai pampering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, teasing<br />Vanadi, consulting the Kudanthai astrolgers, discussing religion with<br />Sembiyan madevi. Kundavai character will lose its importance. So<br />Nandhini was created by Kalki to highlight Kundavai.<br /><br />regards<br /><br />sriraman.p.s.</div>

			<div class="content">hI sriraman<br />first of all we should realise( however hurt we may feel) that KALKI <br />COULD ALSO ERR.<br />Kalki finds in history that two pandya kings are killed in the battle <br />with the cholas. one with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and one with <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>.<br />so he fits in two charecters.( this he mentions in the post script) <br />due to their age diferences he has to make one a small boy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>3. when old Mathurantakan becomes a contender, he too must have been<br />  roped in by Ravidasan as he would be very happy play with two spades</div></blockquote>true. somewhere later in the book a chola appreciates ravithasdan who <br />has now increased the number of contenders for the pandya throne.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>4.May I add another point. nandhini was created just to add support <br />to<br />  Kundavai character.</div></blockquote>I think nandini was created to serve as a sex siren for the book. you <br />cant have historical charecters like kunthavai or vanathi having a <br />full blown romance with romantic( even erotic undertones) dialouges.<br /><br />but when we analyse the fictional charecters created by kalki we see <br />he was more at ease with them.he was able to go into their hearts and <br />speak for them. even a minor charecter like manimekalai comes out with <br />flying colours. pungkuzhali, senthan amudhan,maran,karuthiruman all <br />are full of life ,like real charecters we see in everyday life. <br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>sriraman.p.s.</div></blockquote></div>
