			<div class="content">Priya,<br /><br />As to the first question, I apologize. Slight misunderstanding on my<br />part. I thought you were talking about right and wrong and their<br />relationship to success and failure. I realise now you were just<br />talking abt success and failure regardless of how many people are<br />killed or affected. I have no issues with your argument then.<br /><br />Ofcourse, I do not agree(I cannot see how anyone could) that just<br />because an idea is successful(for certain definitions of the word<br />success), the criticisms against it can be called meaningless but<br />then again, thats your view. Cool.<br /><br />The only remaining factual issue I have with your response is the<br />statement that "Nazism benefited germans" - you seem to forget that<br />Germany happened to have as its citizens thousands of Jews, gypsies<br />and other peoples who happened to be killed in the Holocaust. But<br />then, I forget you look only at the "collective benefit" regardless<br />of the costs!<br /><br />As to the second question, you seem to have missed the point. Most<br />analysts agree with your view that BJP is definitely successful with<br />the rich and the upper classes/castes - in fact, that is what a lot<br />of people even have against the BJP. You seem to forget that no one<br />called any BJP supporters backward. Then again, lets please not make<br />statements like 'BJP will win 90% of the NRI vote' when we have no<br />reasonable evidence to prove it. As you very well know(being a stat<br />student), talking to friends, relatives and acquaintances across the<br />country is not a reasonable sample space to assume anything. Note: I<br />am not trying to say that they won't win, but just that you and I do<br />not have enough info to chumma make tall statements like that.<br /><br />Veena<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />  wrote:<br /> <br />  &#40;q=question by veena,A=my answer&#41;<br /> <br />  Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become<br />  meaningless" -<br />  What exactly is "everything else"? Gross generalization with no<br />  substance. The Nazi party was actually "democratically" elected<br />and<br />  most of the German population went on peacefully with their lives<br />  during the Holocaust. Doesn&#39;t make "anything else"&#40;whatever that<br />  means&#41; meaningless.<br /> <br />  A:I meant that sentence to give the following meaning.Once people<br />  accept an ideology the criticisms against it become meaningless.The<br />  success or failure of an ideology lies solely with the people.If it<br />  benefits X number of people and harms Y number of people,the odds<br />  for the success of the ideology is in the ratio of X:Y.<br /> <br />  Nazism benefited germans&#40;X&#41;.It harmed the rest of the world<br />  &#40;y&#41;.Here X:Y ratio was too low.So the ideology collapsed.For every<br />  ideology there is an X:Y ratio.Higher the ratio higher is the<br />  probablity for success.If somebody from the non-hindutva camp<br />  estimates the X:Y ratio for hindutva it will be in the ratio of<br />  86:14.Somebody in the hindutva camp will estimate it to be<br />  100:0.Whichever ratio you use,the ratio is high.<br /> <br />  So the criticisms against hindutva are meaningless.<br /> <br />  Q:<br /> <br />  "To call a party that represents half the indian population and<br />  10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward is...it<br />  boils down to your word against 50% of the population." -<br /> <br />  - Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the party.<br />  - Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all.<br />  - Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted because of<br />  reasons quoted by author.<br />  - Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which are<br />    such huge players in India nowadays.<br />  - Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward.<br /> <br />  A:It includes everything.If nonvoters vote too,it will be in the<br />  ratio of voters only.For example if an election is conducted with<br />  following results.<br /> <br />  population=100,votes polled =70,BJP=36,congress=34.<br /> <br />  If the remaining votes are also polled then they too will be in the<br />  ratio of 36:34 only according to statistics&#40;normal distirbution<br />laws<br />  and sampling laws state that.If you want I will give you the<br />  statsitical theorums to prove this&#41;There is no reason to believe<br />  that the remaining 30% will be different from the 70% who voted.<br /> <br />  &#40;p.s_I am stat student&#41;<br /> <br />  Voters voted why doesnt matter.BJP has clearly stated its agenda<br />and<br />  said it will implement it if it wins.If a person who doesnt like<br />  BJP&#39;s agenda but hates congress more than BJP votes to bjp because<br />  of the TINA factor&#40;there is no alternative&#41;he cannot then complain<br />  if BJP implements its agenda.<br /> <br />  Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It gets votes in<br />  GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-hardly<br />  backward states.To the contrary rich and upper class support<br />BJP.I&#39;m<br />  in tennessee but have travelled to most parts of USA. I bet that if<br />  an election is conducted among the NRI&#39;s in USA , BJP will win with<br />  90% of votes.There is overwhelming support to BJP among NRI&#39;s in<br />  USA. They are not backward.<br /> <br /> <br />  Q: If as the author implies, most or all of the Islamic world<br />  supports fundamentalism, by her own arugument, "as people have<br />  accepted the ideology, everything else is meaningless". Its her<br />  word against the entire Islamic/Christian world!<br /> <br />  Which Islam do you talk about?Spiritual islam has a very<br />  high X:Y ratio.If Islam is followed like how Abdul Kalam follows<br />  it,like how mullah nasruddin followed it,it has a 100:0 rate of<br />  benefit:harm.<br /> <br />  If you talk about jihadi Islam,the likes followed by<br />  ushama and co the X:Y ratio of that ideology is gonna be 1:100<br />  million,it will be doomed by the harm it does.Ushama and company<br />now<br />  fight Europe,America,china,india,Russia,-more than 80% of world<br />  population.Will he ever win this war?No way.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Well, now that I read your mail again, more inconsistencies seem to<br />crop up.<br /><br />1. Something about how an ideology will be embraced by the people if<br />it benefits them. How do you define benefit and how does a society<br />measure collective benefit/harm? I am sure you are talking<br />about 'perceived benefit' here. For example, the Bush tax cuts<br />affected the poor in this country - it cut their welfare schemes by a<br />large % this cutting long-term economic benefits. But still a large %<br />of the people who will be affected by this still voted for him. Its a<br />well known fact(you can look up any kind of election literature) that<br />a good % of people in any election vote against their economic<br />interests. If you are right about people always voting for things<br />that benefit them, an idea called 'propaganda' will not exist in this<br />world today. Perception is not reality!<br /><br />2. You talk something abt a success ratio for Hindutva. The idea,<br />might very well succeed but history has taught us time and time again<br />that no ideology(however good or bad it may be) stays at the top or<br />bottom forever. Its a cycle that all must go through.<br /><br />3. You talk abt a 'high' ratio for the success of Hindutva. Again,<br />the idea might very well succeed for a time but who gave you these<br />86, 14 type ratios? Where is the basis? Any factual proof or just<br />from thin air? The more I read this, the more I get the feeling that<br />this logic is similar to certain ratios that the 'people's communist<br />republics' talked abt in the last century.<br /><br />Veena<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />  wrote:<br /> <br />  &#40;q=question by veena,A=my answer&#41;<br /> <br />  Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become<br />  meaningless" -<br />  What exactly is "everything else"?

			<div class="content">--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Priya,<br />Ofcourse, I do not agree&#40;I cannot see how anyone could&#41; that just</div></blockquote>because an idea is successful(for certain definitions of the word<br />success), the criticisms against it can be called meaningless but<br />then again, thats your view. Cool.<br /><br /><br />Reply:My definition for success is acceptance by the<br />concerned group.Criticisms going meaningless means that the purpose<br />of criticism is defeated.The ciritics of an ideology criticize it so<br />that it doesnt get popular.If it becomes popular inspite of it then<br />criticisms still remain,but it becomes meaningless.<br /><br />If people criticize an established ideology<br />then again we have to see whats the purpose of their criticism.For<br />example an atheist criticizing religion comes under this category.We<br />have to see why he still criticizes after knowing that he cannot<br />destroy something which exists for thousands of years.If he attains<br />his objective,whatever it might be,then that criticism becomes<br />meaningful.For example periyar(I detest him,but still)criticized<br />religion.He achieved some objectives and failed in others.So his<br />criticisms werent meaningless.<br /><br /><br />question:The only remaining factual issue I have with your response<br />is the statement that "Nazism benefited germans" - you seem to<br />forget that Germany happened to have as its citizens thousands of<br />Jews, gypsies and other peoples who happened to be killed in the<br />Holocaust. But then, I forget you look only at the "collective<br />benefit" regardless of the costs!<br /><br />answer:I should have said "Nazism benefited aryan germans".I believe<br />that the collective benefit proudced by nazism was negative.If<br />nazism benefited around 100 million aryan germans it killed around<br />50 million people in Russia alone.If we calculate 4 mouners per dead<br />person the costs far outweigh the benefits,so the ideology collapsed.<br /><br />For everything there is a cost.If benefits outweigh costs<br />then anything is useful.If costs outweigh benefits then anything is<br />useless.What Do I mean by benfits and costs?How to calculate it?<br />Thats an interesting topic.<br /><br /><br />question: As to the second question, you seem to have missed the<br />point. Most analysts agree with your view that BJP is definitely<br />successful with the rich and the upper classes/castes - in fact,<br />that is what a lot of people even have against the BJP. You seem to<br />forget that no one called any BJP supporters backward. Then again,<br />lets please not make statements like 'BJP will win 90% of the NRI<br />vote' when we have no reasonable evidence to prove it. As you very<br />well know(being a stat student), talking to friends, relatives and<br />acquaintances across the country is not a reasonable sample space<br />to assume anything. Note: I am not trying to say that they won't<br />win, but just that you and I do not have enough info to chumma make<br />tall statements like that.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Veena</div></blockquote><br />reply:I am not just chumma making that statement.I read that in many<br />magazines.Congress even made complaints to election comission that<br />BJP gets large funds from NRI's during election times.I also read<br />feedback pages of outlook which is antibjp.There every feedback<br />outlook gets from abroad is pro bjp.<br /><br />Also the NRI's constitute of upper classes and bhramins.In<br />every election the upper castes always support<br />BJP.Jats,kurmis,thakurs all vote BJP.Bhramin vote will never move<br />away from BJP.<br /><br />recently arundathi roy in her article accepted that she<br />will be condemned by NRI's and she said she wont bother about it.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />    wrote:<br />   <br />    &#40;q=question by veena,A=my answer&#41;<br />   <br />    Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become<br />    meaningless" -<br />    What exactly is "everything else"?

Something about how an ideology will be embraced by the people<br />if it benefits them. How do you define benefit and how does a<br />society measure collective benefit/harm? I am sure you are talking<br />about 'perceived benefit' here. For example, the Bush tax cuts<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>affected the poor in this country - it cut their welfare schemes<br />by a large % this cutting long-term economic benefits. But still a</div></blockquote>large % of the people who will be affected by this still voted for<br />him. Its a well known fact(you can look up any kind of election<br />literature) that a good % of people in any election vote against<br />their economic interests. If you are right about people always<br />voting for things that benefit them, an idea called 'propaganda'<br />will not exist in this world today. Perception is not reality!<br /><br /><br /><br />A:There is nothing in the world which is 100% good and 100% bad.So<br />when somebody makes a choice he will choose something which<br />maximizes his self interest.Self interest and economic benefits are<br />totally different things.Every person has his own standards to<br />measure his self interest.If X can make Y to believe that Y can<br />maximize his self interest by doing what X says then X is the king.<br /><br />As an example kerry said that american well being lies in a better<br />economy.Bush convinced people that rather than going for money<br />following jesus will maximize theior self interest.He offered<br />himself as the alternative to attain that self interest<br />maximization.People chose him as a result.Kerry lost since he<br />thought people will prefer economics over god.<br /><br />People who voted for Bush thought that religion will maximize their<br />self interest than money.Money is a way to maximize self<br />interest,not an end by itself.Propogands plays a crucial role here.<br /><br /><br />Q: You talk something abt a success ratio for Hindutva. The idea,<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>might very well succeed but history has taught us time and time<br />again that no ideology&#40;however good or bad it may be&#41; stays at the</div></blockquote>top or bottom forever. Its a cycle that all must go through.<br /><br />A:No need to be number 1.An ideologies success is measured by the<br />number of lives it benefits.<br /><br />q: You talk abt a 'high' ratio for the success of Hindutva. Again,<br />the idea might very well succeed for a time but who gave you these<br />86, 14 type ratios? Where is the basis? Any factual proof or just<br />from thin air? The more I read this, the more I get the feeling<br />that this logic is similar to certain ratios that the 'people's<br />communist republics' talked abt in the last century.<br /><br />a: Hindutva will benefit hindus.There are 86% hindus in the<br />country.The remaining 14% are minorities who feel that hindutva will<br />harm them.So the benefit cost ratio of hindutva is 86:14.</div>

Time<br />constraint, what to do.<br /><br />Re. the Balaji temple in Birmingham....it was not done at the cost of<br />the local christians and thats what we too call secularism.<br /><br />Forgot to write about the lIngam concept yesterday. Just to calrify,<br />Sri, your concept about the lingam structure is also logical, but as<br />far as I know, even the cylindrical part is called lingam and the<br />aavudayar which symbolises female, is a part of the lingam is<br />optional. Kasi viswanathar is a small semicircular structure without<br />the aavudayar. So comparing it with male organ doenst make sense to me<br />(atleast)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br />Dear All,<br /><br />Our group is the best example to show the strature of our country.<br />When a hot topic which<br /><br />deals with the survival of the Indians or rather the Hindu community<br />(why I said<br /><br />indians,is because without communal peace no one can be happy) only 5-<br />6 members of the<br /><br />total 500+ group members participate. Priay/Veena bashaila sollanumna<br />1% of the total<br /><br />sample space (correct madam's. naan konjam padiparivillathavan.<br />ungala mathiri stats,<br /><br />science ellam enakku theriyathu.thappa erundha mannikanum). This is<br />how our country<br /><br />citizens are also not concerned when it comes to national issues of<br />such intensity.<br /><br />Fine leaving our country's fate behind. The whole issue started with<br />Veena trying blame<br /><br />the Hindu org. where as I defended saying only because of such org.<br />major conversions are<br /><br />averted. otherwise whole country will be dominated by the so called<br />minorities.(why 'so<br /><br />called' - because, generally anywhere in the world, the majority<br />population dominates the<br /><br />minorities. But only in India, the minority population dominates the<br />majority. Priya I<br /><br />think your ration is wrong its not 86:14 but 82:18.correct me if I am<br />wrong. For releasing<br /><br />this statistics the Head of the census comittee was transfered, I<br />suppose)<br /><br />Sampath, Priya,myself and others qoted many valid points, which Sri<br />and veena are not<br /><br />ready to accept and they deviate from our points and repeatedly quote<br />stray<br /><br />incidents.(edhu than reading between the lines nu solluvangala. Eppa<br />than atha practicala<br /><br />pakkaren...).Probably they are in stray incident finding mission.<br /><br />I gave the list of destructions caused by Hindu org. and the muslim<br />terrorist, but no<br /><br />reply.<br /><br />Sampath explained about the discriminations, again no reply for that.<br />Repeatedly points<br /><br />are getting deviated with stray incidents.<br /><br />If I say, all the news published in the media is not true and support<br />it with evidence, I<br /><br />am blamed of not accepting the facts. If we say, vedas are not wrong,<br />and only people are<br /><br />wrong, time and again scriptures are criticised. If we say, there was<br />no caste based<br /><br />society in Hinduism, time and again its being repeated that upper<br />caste discriminate the<br /><br />lower caste. All stray incidents hold high importance to others.<br />Today I read a news that<br /><br />a 19 year old Indian girl was stripped and tortured by her boss in<br />Malaysia and alleged<br /><br />that she stole money. I think I should interpret this news as all<br />Malaysians are torturing<br /><br />Indians in Malaysia and Malaysian men alwasy strip Indian girls and<br />torture them.<br /><br />Sampath, Priya and all other Hindutva supporters, I think we are<br />going wrong somewhere.<br /><br />Let me try to put an anology for this.<br /><br />Theres a family (like our age old joint family) an ideal family<br />living peacefull,<br /><br />happily,traditionally, culturally etc.etc. There are father, mother,<br />children, mama,<br /><br />mami,chittappa, periyappa, anna, thambi, akka, thangai etc...Such a<br />big joint family<br /><br />surely<br />will have internal misunderstandings and small issues. But still they<br />are living happily.<br /><br />Here comes a neighbour who feels jealous about this family and wants<br />to loot them of thier<br /><br />riches. He closely observes them. Husband and wife has some<br />misunderstanding, appa-magan<br /><br />is having some rupture. annan-thambi is having a small fight.<br />likewise there are several<br /><br />small issues which any family has. veetukku veedu vasappadi. But<br />still the try to settle<br /><br />down and live happily. They know its part and parcel of life.<br /><br />This neighbour, enters this family and poses to be their well wisher.<br />Slowly he corrupts<br /><br />the minds of each individual, seperately by saying something bad<br />about the others(like our<br /><br />TV serials). To the father he says, you are retired your sons are not<br />respecting you<br /><br />anymore. To the wife he says your husband is dominating you and<br />treating you as a slave.<br /><br />etc.Slowly everone gets corrupted by mind(afterall arpa manida<br />pathargal illiya) and<br /><br />starts quarrelling amidst them.<br /><br />During this quarrel, the neighbours(not just one, many) wants to loot<br />them and take away<br /><br />the wealth(including the people, their girls etc). One person kidnaps<br />the inmates. Other<br /><br />try to keep on telling wrong about the family members to others and<br />is creating a split in<br /><br />the family. Other person wants to capture the property itself and<br />demolishes the rooms of<br /><br />the inmates because its not of his taste and throws them away.<br />Someone tells the wives<br /><br />that they are treated as slaves and forces them to get divorce.<br />Theifs start entering<br /><br />their private areas and are looting them like anything. Even the<br />family members are killed<br /><br />in large numbers by a set of neighbours.<br /><br />In this state, Priya, Sampath et all, what we say is, we should fight<br />(physically or<br /><br />legally is not the question here. If we take the legal path, by the<br />time the case finishes<br /><br />the family would have also been finished). We say at least we need a<br />security gaurd like<br /><br />the RSS, VHP etc.who can, to some extent protect us.<br /><br />But we are wrong. Sri, Veena et al, says that we should first sort<br />out our problems within<br /><br />the family. Each family member should be treated equally and should<br />be assured that they<br /><br />will be treated equally(which at first place is not at all valid<br />because, there was no<br />discrimination in the first place). We should not talk about the<br />murders done by the<br /><br />neighbours, but we should solve the internal issues first. We should<br />not bother about the<br /><br />kidnapping of our children, but should solve the family feuds first.<br />We should not even<br /><br />have security gaurds to protect our family and we should solve our<br />internal problem first.<br /><br />People with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>47 will come to kill the family members, but the<br />security gaurds should not<br /><br />even stop them by holding their hand or slapping them on the face. If<br />RSS,VHP slap them<br /><br />then they are terrorists. So they should not stop them. They will<br />destruct our house at<br /><br />thier will but we should not questiong them or react to their<br />actions. Because first we<br /><br />need to sort our family issues. Thats more important right.After all<br />we need not have any<br /><br />security gaurds to protect our lives and property, when we have lots<br />of family issues.<br /><br />When we have so much problems in the family, we dont have the right<br />to condemn others who<br /><br />come to create more problem in the family. If we do we are<br />terrorists, extremists. We<br /><br />should not protect ourselves, because the family members are more in<br />number than the<br /><br />looting neighbours. They are minority and we should support them. We<br />should join hands<br /><br />with them and kill our own family members. We should join with them<br />and destruct our own<br /><br />house,because if we oppose, we are (Hindutva) extremists. We should<br />first iron out the<br /><br />misunderstanding, quarrels amongst us before we try to blame them.<br />Once we sort out our<br /><br />internal issue,which will never happen bacuase of human nature, then<br />we can start solving<br /><br />the problems with the external members(if any family member is left<br />out.but thats not of<br /><br />concern now. Becuase sorting our internal issue is much important)<br /><br />So again priya, Sampath and other friends, we are on the wrong side .<br />We should change our<br /><br />attitudes. We should not support Hindutva. We should not blame the<br />muslims are christians.<br /><br />Hinduism has lots of holes init and if possible lets get converted to<br />Christianity or<br /><br />Islam. After all we have lot of issues within us, right. So lets<br />blame ourselves for state<br /><br />we are in. What will they do in the mean time. Muslims will kill all<br />the emaining Hindus<br /><br />and Christians will convert all the left out Hindus. We are not going<br />to loose<br /><br />anything,becuase we have internal problems which is of great concern.<br />We will join hands<br /><br />together to sort this first before questioning the Govt. or the<br />muslims or the christians.<br /><br />We should not support RSS, VHP and like org. because they are fit to<br />only blame others and<br /><br />will only slap them if they come to kill us. Slapping is wrong<br />because Jesus said, if<br /><br />someone slaps you, show your other cheek. Let us try to find more<br />faults in Hinduism and<br /><br />try to fix those issues first.<br /><br />Thanks to Sri , Veena and the like minded who enlightened me and<br />cleared my<br /><br />misconceptions. A great learning indeed. I feel much enlightened and<br />knowledgable now. My<br /><br />learnings about Hinduism has been proved wrong and I regret wasting<br />my time to learn them.<br /><br />We have internal issues in Hinduism which are of primary importance.<br /><br />During Partition, Ambedkar, who is an ICON for the SC/ST's even<br />today, said, all the<br /><br />muslims should quit India since they have thier own land Pakistan<br />now.Later he himself<br /><br />converted to Buddism, thats another part of the story. But when he<br />was questioned why he<br /><br />is supporting that India should be a Hindu country, when he is<br />treated an outcast, he<br /><br />said, thats Hinduisms internal problem and we will sort it out<br />ourselves. But the main<br /><br />concern for the country is Muslims should quit so that both Hindus<br />and Muslims can live<br /><br />peacefully. I think he is a fool to have said that. First he should<br />have tried to sort out<br /><br />the issues in Hinduism and then should have asked Muslims to quit<br />Inida.<br /><br />Benny Hinn will call Hindus as Prostitues and all congress leaders<br />will clap for that. We<br /><br />should not oppose because we have internal problems. We should accept<br />that we are<br /><br />prostitutes and support the christians because they are minorities.He<br />will spend 40 laksh<br /><br />and arranges for a meeting to 300000 people and police will find out<br />that prior to the<br /><br />meeting, lots of college and School students are trained to act on<br />stage as if getting<br /><br />cured by Benny hinn and will convert, but we should not question it<br />because we have<br /><br />internal problems. Pope John Paul, who is a religious leader<br /><br />Muslims will target even the IT companies in Bangalore, but we should<br />not condemn them<br /><br />because we have internal problems. If possible we should help them by<br />providing bombs to<br /><br />them. Graham stains wife, who is no one to India, will be nominated<br />for Padma Bhushan<br /><br />award, but we should not oppose it becuase minorities should feel<br />happy in India.<br /><br />Thanks once again.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Whatever. Criticisms are the only reason any change takes place in<br />any system and thats important to the improvement of that system. If<br />we all sit and say that the ideology has succeeded, lets all keep<br />quiet, nothing will ever come out of it. You yourself cited the right<br />example - Periyar.<br /><br />Yeah. Outlook's feedback writers all are NRIs, so all NRIs are anti-<br />BJP. Great logic. Thanks for your input.<br /><br />More factual issues:"Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It<br />gets votes in GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-<br />hardly backward states" - I don't see how one can call these states<br />forward and all else backward. Also, you would also want to check how<br />many of them are actually ruled by the BJP.<br /><br />Thanks for your thoughts Priya. But I am going to have end this<br />conversation here as I believe we know exactly where each other<br />stand. And the more I read caste-loaded statements, the more I think<br />there's no common point for us to maintain a conversation. Thanks<br />again and have a nice day!<br /><br />Veena<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    Priya,<br />  Ofcourse, I do not agree&#40;I cannot see how anyone could&#41; that just<br />  because an idea is successful&#40;for certain definitions of the word<br />  success&#41;, the criticisms against it can be called meaningless but<br />  then again, thats your view. Cool.<br /> <br /> <br />  Reply:My definition for success is acceptance by<br />the<br />  concerned group.Criticisms going meaningless means that the purpose<br />  of criticism is defeated.The ciritics of an ideology criticize it<br />so<br />  that it doesnt get popular.If it becomes popular inspite of it then<br />  criticisms still remain,but it becomes meaningless.<br /> <br />  If people criticize an established ideology<br />  then again we have to see whats the purpose of their criticism.For<br />  example an atheist criticizing religion comes under this<br />category.We<br />  have to see why he still criticizes after knowing that he cannot<br />  destroy something which exists for thousands of years.If he attains<br />  his objective,whatever it might be,then that criticism becomes<br />  meaningful.For example periyar&#40;I detest him,but still&#41;criticized<br />  religion.He achieved some objectives and failed in others.So his<br />  criticisms werent meaningless.<br /> <br /> <br />  question:The only remaining factual issue I have with your response<br />  is the statement that "Nazism benefited germans" - you seem to<br />  forget that Germany happened to have as its citizens thousands of<br />  Jews, gypsies and other peoples who happened to be killed in the<br />  Holocaust. But then, I forget you look only at the "collective<br />  benefit" regardless of the costs!<br /> <br />  answer:I should have said "Nazism benefited aryan germans".I<br />believe<br />  that the collective benefit proudced by nazism was negative.If<br />  nazism benefited around 100 million aryan germans it killed around<br />  50 million people in Russia alone.If we calculate 4 mouners per<br />dead<br />  person the costs far outweigh the benefits,so the ideology<br />collapsed.<br /> <br />  For everything there is a cost.If benefits outweigh costs<br />  then anything is useful.If costs outweigh benefits then anything<br />is<br />  useless.What Do I mean by benfits and costs?How to calculate it?<br />  Thats an interesting topic.<br /> <br /> <br />  question: As to the second question, you seem to have missed the<br />  point. Most analysts agree with your view that BJP is definitely<br />  successful with the rich and the upper classes/castes - in fact,<br />  that is what a lot of people even have against the BJP. You seem<br />to<br />  forget that no one called any BJP supporters backward. Then again,<br />  lets please not make statements like &#39;BJP will win 90% of the NRI<br />  vote&#39; when we have no reasonable evidence to prove it. As you very<br />  well know&#40;being a stat student&#41;, talking to friends, relatives and<br />  acquaintances across the country is not a reasonable sample space<br />  to assume anything. Note: I am not trying to say that they won&#39;t<br />  win, but just that you and I do not have enough info to chumma<br />make<br />  tall statements like that.<br />   <br />    Veena<br /> <br /> <br />  reply:I am not just chumma making that statement.I read that in<br />many<br />  magazines.Congress even made complaints to election comission that<br />  BJP gets large funds from NRI&#39;s during election times.I also read<br />  feedback pages of outlook which is antibjp.There every feedback<br />  outlook gets from abroad is pro bjp.<br /> <br />  Also the NRI&#39;s constitute of upper classes and bhramins.In<br />  every election the upper castes always support<br />  BJP.Jats,kurmis,thakurs all vote BJP.Bhramin vote will never move<br />  away from BJP.<br /> <br />  recently arundathi roy in her article accepted that she<br />  will be condemned by NRI&#39;s and she said she wont bother about it.<br /> <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />      wrote:<br />     <br />      &#40;q=question by veena,A=my answer&#41;<br />     <br />      Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become<br />      meaningless" -<br />      What exactly is "everything else"? Gross generalization with<br />no<br />      substance. The Nazi party was actually "democratically"<br />elected<br />    and<br />      most of the German population went on peacefully with their<br />  lives<br />      during the Holocaust. Doesn&#39;t make "anything else"&#40;whatever<br />  that<br />      means&#41; meaningless.<br />     <br />      A:I meant that sentence to give the following meaning.Once<br />  people<br />      accept an ideology the criticisms against it become<br />  meaningless.The<br />      success or failure of an ideology lies solely with the<br />people.If<br />  it<br />      benefits X number of people and harms Y number of people,the<br />  odds<br />      for the success of the ideology is in the ratio of X:Y.<br />     <br />      Nazism benefited germans&#40;X&#41;.It harmed the rest of the world<br />      &#40;y&#41;.Here X:Y ratio was too low.So the ideology collapsed.For<br />  every<br />      ideology there is an X:Y ratio.Higher the ratio higher is the<br />      probablity for success.If somebody from the non-hindutva camp<br />      estimates the X:Y ratio for hindutva it will be in the ratio of<br />      86:14.Somebody in the hindutva camp will estimate it to be<br />      100:0.Whichever ratio you use,the ratio is high.<br />     <br />      So the criticisms against hindutva are meaningless.<br />     <br />      Q:<br />     <br />      "To call a party that represents half the indian population and<br />      10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward<br />  is...it<br />      boils down to your word against 50% of the population." -<br />     <br />      - Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the<br />  party.<br />      - Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all.<br />      - Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted<br />because<br />  of<br />      reasons quoted by author.<br />      - Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which<br />  are<br />        such huge players in India nowadays.<br />      - Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward.<br />     <br />      A:It includes everything.If nonvoters vote too,it will be in<br />the<br />      ratio of voters only.For example if an election is conducted<br />  with<br />      following results.<br />     <br />      population=100,votes polled =70,BJP=36,congress=34.<br />     <br />      If the remaining votes are also polled then they too will be in<br />  the<br />      ratio of 36:34 only according to statistics&#40;normal distirbution<br />    laws<br />      and sampling laws state that.If you want I will give you the<br />      statsitical theorums to prove this&#41;There is no reason to<br />believe<br />      that the remaining 30% will be different from the 70% who voted.<br />     <br />      &#40;p.s_I am stat student&#41;<br />     <br />      Voters voted why doesnt matter.BJP has clearly stated its<br />agenda<br />    and<br />      said it will implement it if it wins.If a person who doesnt<br />like<br />      BJP&#39;s agenda but hates congress more than BJP votes to bjp<br />  because<br />      of the TINA factor&#40;there is no alternative&#41;he cannot then<br />  complain<br />      if BJP implements its agenda.<br />     <br />      Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It gets votes in<br />      GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-hardly<br />      backward states.To the contrary rich and upper class support<br />    BJP.I&#39;m<br />      in tennessee but have travelled to most parts of USA. I bet<br />that<br />  if<br />      an election is conducted among the NRI&#39;s in USA , BJP will win<br />  with<br />      90% of votes.There is overwhelming support to BJP among NRI&#39;s<br />in<br />      USA. They are not backward.<br />     <br />     <br />      Q: If as the author implies, most or all of the Islamic world<br />      supports fundamentalism, by her own arugument, "as people have<br />      accepted the ideology, everything else is meaningless". Its<br />her<br />      word against the entire Islamic/Christian world!<br />     <br />      Which Islam do you talk about?Spiritual islam has a<br />  very<br />      high X:Y ratio.If Islam is followed like how Abdul Kalam<br />follows<br />      it,like how mullah nasruddin followed it,it has a 100:0 rate of<br />      benefit:harm.<br />     <br />      If you talk about jihadi Islam,the likes followed by<br />      ushama and co the X:Y ratio of that ideology is gonna be 1:100<br />      million,it will be doomed by the harm it does.Ushama and<br />company<br />    now<br />      fight Europe,America,china,india,Russia,-more than 80% of world<br />      population.Will he ever win this war?No way.</div></blockquote></div>
