THEODORE BASKARAN<br /><br />THE value of private collections in preserving the print heritage of <br />the country has been recognised only in recent years, and there have <br />been several initiatives to make them accessible to researchers and <br />other scholars. These collections could provide a new dimension to <br />historiography, prove to be repositories of source material for <br />scholars, and enable us to understand society better. <br />  <br />Inside the Roja Muthiah Research Library in Chennai. Keeping Muthiah <br />Chettiar's collection as the nucleus, the holdings of the library are <br />being expanded through additional acquisitions. <br />  <br />One such attempt is the Roja Muthiah Research Library (RMRL) in <br />Chennai, the lifetime collection of an unconventional bibliophile. <br />Established in April 1994, it is emerging as a major research centre <br />for South Asian studies, especially the social and cul tural history <br />of South India. <br />  <br />Muthiah Chettiar, a painter of signs, moved to Chennai from <br />Kottaiyur, a tiny village in the Chettinad region of Tamil Nadu, and <br />set up a sign board shop, Roja Arts. He had inherited from his father <br />a fascination for imprints and began collecting them. F irst he <br />bought books relating to art, particularly paintings, and gradually <br />his interest extended to other subjects. In Chennai he got to know <br />book dealers of the now defunct Moore Market, and was introduced to <br />the world of antiquarian books. He was also in touch with scrap paper <br />dealers, from whom he could get the magazines he wanted. <br />  <br />With business not doing too well in Chennai, Muthiah Chettiar moved <br />back to Kottaiyur. He hoarded his treasure there in a rented building <br />adjacent to his ancestral house. At the time of his death in 1992, at <br />the age of 66, his collection had grown to nea rly 100,000 items in <br />Tamil - books, journals and single sheet material such as drama <br />notices, some of them dating back to 1886. The collection covers the <br />whole gamut of Tamil culture and heritage, and the items span a <br />period of more than 150 years, the e arliest being a book, Kandar <br />Andhathi, published in 1804. <br />  <br />It was in 1975 that this writer first visited Kottaiyur and met <br />Muthiah Chettiar. By that time the fact that he had such a collection <br />was known to some researchers although none had any clear idea of <br />what it contained. Muthiah Chettiar called his collect ion India <br />Library Services. <br />  <br />For consulting his books he charged a modest fee - which covered <br />coffee and lunch as well. He would give books one at a time, and at <br />times one got to browse just two books in a day. I kept in touch with <br />him and met him wheneve r he visited Chennai. He was always concerned <br />about the care of the collection after his time. <br />  <br />C.S. Lakshmi (Ambai), the Tamil writer and scholar on women's <br />studies, visited Kottaiyur to use India Library Services for her <br />research on women in India. Much later, when she was at the <br />University of Chicago as a scholar-in-residence, she briefed South <br />Asia scholars there about Muthiah Chettiar's collection. The <br />university launched a global effort to save the material. It bought <br />the entire collection from the family. It had been decided that the <br />collection would remain in Tamil Nadu to form the nucleus of a <br />research library on South Indian studies, in collaboration with the <br />Chennai-based Mozhi Trust, an organisation set up to develop <br />resources for language and culture. <br />  <br />Muthiah Chettiar had all varieties of printed material covering the <br />whole gamut of Tamil culture and heritage. <br />An oleograph being retrieved from storage. <br />  <br />The trustees of Mozhi saw in the project scope to develop <br />systematically a comprehensive facility that would acquire all <br />varieties of printed material - both book and non-book - and conserve <br />them through preservation microfilming. James Nye, bibliographe r for <br />Southern Asia and Director of the Centre for Research Libraries at <br />the University of Chicago, and Cre-A Ramakrishnan, the innovative <br />publisher, along with P. Sankaralingam, Reader in the Library Science <br />Department of the University of Madras, went about the task of <br />setting up a digital library. From: Kottaiyur the material, packed in <br />1,110 specially designed cardboard boxes, was moved in five trucks, <br />to the library building at Mogappair in Chennai. Sankaralingam, who <br />took over as the full-time dire ctor of the library, emerged as the <br />man for the moment. His dream was to provide under one roof research <br />material and facilities for students of South Indian studies in <br />fields ranging from humanities to social sciences. He drew up a <br />project to catalogue and microfilm the collection. He set about the <br />task of organising shelving facilities, installing microfilm cameras <br />and creating machine-readable catalogue records compatible with major <br />international systems. <br />  <br />In order to orient the staff to preservation microfilming, a workshop <br />was conducted in Chennai by Julio Berrios, Chief of Micrographics, <br />Library of Congress, Washington D.C. Personnel from other <br />organisations involved in similar work, such as the Tamil Nadu <br />Archives, the Theosophical Society Librar y and the Library of <br />Congress division at the United States embassy in New Delhi also <br />participated in the workshop. (Sankaralingam passed away in 1997, and <br />this writer became the Director of the library.) <br />  <br />Printed material has a rather short lifetime owing to the high acid <br />content in paper. Acid reacts with the atmosphere and turns the paper <br />brown and brittle. If such material is handled frequently, it will <br />lead to further damage. So it is necessary to sto re the contents of <br />books in an archival medium. Worldwide, microfilming is the accepted <br />form of archival preservation as far as printed material is <br />concerned. If microfilm rolls are stored as per standards set by the <br />archival community, they can easily l ast for 500 years. <br />  <br />Researchers can access the contents of a book through a microfilm <br />reader, instead of having to handle the original imprint. At RMRL, <br />cataloguing and microfilming are done simultaneously. <br />  <br />The issue dated March 29, 1942, of Navayugam, a Tamil daily, with the <br />news of the death of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose in an <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>crash. <br />  <br />In a major innovation, technologies developed by the Centre for <br />Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, have been adapted to create <br />machine-readable catalogue records. Catalogue data for Tamil items <br />are entered in Tamil script. The system in use at RMRL can display <br />and print the catalogue in Tamil script. Transliteration of the data <br />into Roman script, both for display and printing, is automatic. These <br />catalogues can be loaded into major international systems, including <br />LC MARC and OCLC, the largest bib liographic databases in the world. <br />Support for the project came in the form of grants from various <br />sources, the Wellcome Research Institute, London, the Ford <br />Foundation, and later the Government of India. Now the work of <br />cataloguing and indexing of the articles in the magazines is halfway <br />through. <br />THE strength of the library lies in the variety of subjects on which <br />Muthiah Chettiar collected books and the attention he paid to non-<br />book material and books such as theatre handbills containing film <br />songs and even some private letters. These strengths define the <br />direction in which the collection should grow. Ever since the library <br />was set up, handbills, invitations and other ephemera are being added <br />to the collection. <br />  <br />A 1936 handbill publicising a drama featuring Devudu Ayyer and <br />Subbaiya Naidu among others. <br />  <br />Muthiah Chettiar's collection can be classified broadly into three. <br />The first is literature, both classical and contemporary. This <br />includes devotional literature, an area that has not received much <br />attention from Indian scholars. The second category, ind igenous <br />medicine, includes classical medical books from different traditions, <br />such as Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani. For example, there is a <br />collection of aphoristic and quoted verses forming the core of Siddha <br />medicine; the complete writings attributed to Agasthiyar, and a <br />collection of Nadisastiram, the diagnostic manuals based on the <br />reading of the pulse. Traditional medicine was one of Muthiah <br />Chettiar's interests, and he himself has written a book on antidotes <br />to scorpion bite. The third set pertains to aspects of popular <br />culture such as ballads, folk songs, drama and cinema. Added to this <br />is a lot of single-sheet material, such as invitations to private <br />functions and newspaper clippings. Popular magazines of the 1930s and <br />1940s offer a rare opportun ity to researchers to chart new scholarly <br />directions. Commenting on Muthiah Chettiar's collection, a scholar <br />records: "Within his library's eclectic range of subject matter, <br />including medicine, folklore, religion, cinema and women's studies, <br />and material s such as theatre playbills and popular song books, <br />Muthiah Chettiar attempted to capture the essence of his people. <br />Scattered worldwide, about 60 million people speak Tamil." <br />  <br />The song book of Harichandra Vilasam. <br />  <br />There are certain works of special interest, such as the complete set <br />of 1,500 verses by Gnana Vaithiyan, which studies the interaction of <br />medical concepts with metaphysics and social issues. There is also <br />the work of Yakobu Munivar, a Tamil convert to I slam, who details in <br />his voluminous book his trip to Mecca and his introduction to the <br />Unani system of medicine there. <br />Padarthaguna Chinthamani is a book published in 1907 on the various <br />uses of local fruits, vegetables and herbs. Of particular importance <br />are the indigenous animal husbandry practices in titles such as <br />Mattuvakatam. <br />A researcher studying the freedom struggle as it manifested in south <br />India will find important material here. For instance, there are <br />Gandhian economist J.C. Kumarappa's books, translated by Kugapriyai, <br />and journals such as Sakthi, which contain numerous articles by <br />Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders such as Indulal Yagnik. <br /><br />Dr. E. Annamalai, a trustee (foreground), and<br />P. Sankaralingam, then director of RMRL, at work in the library. <br /><br />ONE important segment of the collection relates to folklore. With <br />remarkable foresight, Muthiah Chettiar acquired ballads such as <br />Desingurajan Kathai and Nallathangal Kathai, which were published by <br />the end of the 19th century. He collected differ ent versions of <br />these ballads. In fact, acquiring multiple editions of a work was <br />characteristic of him. Considered pedestrian, titles such as these <br />are not preserved in libraries. Yet ballads have come to be <br />recognised as sources of historical and liter ary information. Dr. <br />David D. Schulman, Professor of Indian Studies at the Hebrew <br />University, Jerusalem, elaborated this point in an interview <br />published in Frontline (June 10, 2000). Ballads, he says, are <br />historiographical texts that are just one stage removed from the <br />actual event. If one is sensitive to this fact, then one can discern <br />history in many genres. Several versions of subjects of traditional <br />drama, such as Harichandran Kathai, are also preserved in the <br />library. <br />  <br />Cataloguing work at the library. The data system can display and <br />print catalogues in Tamil script. <br />  <br />RMRL collaborates with other archives across the world. The archive <br />of the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam has <br />sent it a copy of Janamithran, a magazine brought out from Chennai in <br />1920. The Department of Communications of E dith Cowan University, <br />Perth, Australia has given a microfilm version of all volumes of the <br />Indian Cinematographic Committee Enquiry Report of 1929, including <br />the rare fifth volume. RMRL has a collaborative project with the <br />Tamil Nadu Archives and also w ith the Maraimalai Adigal Library. It <br />collaborates with the Kalachuvadu Trust in a project to document the <br />writings of Pudumaipithan, the Tamil writer. Its latest project is a <br />joint venture with the College of Arts and Crafts, Chennai. <br />Keeping Muthiah Chettiar's collection as the nucleus, the holdings of <br />the library are being expanded with additional acquisitions. A vital <br />part of its process of collection is represented by bequests of <br />printed material from scholars. The initial success of the library <br />gained acknowledgement in the form of bequests of valuable <br />collections from renowned scholars such as A.K. Ramanujam, Edward <br />Dimock and Milton Singer. Part of the collection of Gift Siromoney, <br />who was Professor of Statistics at Madras Chr istian College, <br />including his publication on the language of the Narikuravas, a <br />nomadic community of Tamil Nadu, has been received. The library has <br />received a generous donation of books on South Asian studies from <br />scholars such as Kali Charan Bahl. V. Pu rushotham, a lawyer <br />practising in the Madras High Court, whose passion is the chronology <br />of Sangam literature, has donated his collection of nearly 2,000 <br />books. Almost a complete collection of the published works on the <br />Indus script is included in this c ollection. The latest donation <br />comes from Saraswathi Samman award winner Indra Parthasarathy. The <br />collection of contemporary Tamil literature includes impressive runs <br />of the works of Ka. Na. Su and Si. Su. Chellappa. One of the prized <br />imprints that have come to it through a recent bequest is <br />Uthayatharagai, the first Tamil journal printed in 1842. There are 30 <br />issues now with the library. <br />  <br />An old newspaper undergoing preservation procedure. <br />  <br />Recently, RMRL came into possession of print material spanning the <br />War years - 1939-1945. M.S.M.M. Meyyappa Chettiar owned a film <br />distribution company, the South Indian Pictures Corporation, in <br />Chennai. During the War the company operated from Karaikudi. In June <br />1999, his grandson, Meyyappan Jr, contacted the library and offered <br />to donate a collection of magazines and documents he possessed at his <br />ancestral house at Karaikudi. The RMRL team set out promptly and <br />brought in the hoard, which included seven dailies, 12 magazines from <br />the War period, song books and publicity brochures, and a near <br />complete set of the acts and rules relating to the film industry that <br />were enforced during the British period. For instance, the government <br />had passed an order tha t as a measure of economy the length of a <br />film should not exceed 11,000 feet. If a film-maker made a film <br />supporting the War, then preference was given in the supply of raw <br />stock. This order is in the form of a booklet. Recently, RMRL located <br />the collect ion of freedom fighter Covai Ayyamuthu in Pollachi, and <br />microfilmed the titles. There are other private collections too, <br />though not as large as Muthiah Chettiar's, scattered in various parts <br />of Tamil Nadu. Work is on to create a network of these collecti ons <br />in order to provide better access to more extensive Tamil source <br />material. <br />Although microfilming is considered to be the answer for long-term <br />storage, for short-term use and quick retrieval, scholars prefer the <br />digital medium. Apart from the flat-bed scanner used for scanning <br />paper material, the library has acquired a state-of- the-art <br />microfilm digital-scanning equipment. Using this, microfilm can be <br />scanned and the images can be either stored on compact disks (CDs) <br />and digital video disks (DVDs) or the images can be made accessible <br />through cyberspace. The equipment is capable of producing high-<br />quality images that can be transferred even for the purpose of <br />publishing. <br />  <br />  <br />Exposed microfilm being checked for quality before being stored. <br />  <br />RMRL aims to develop on a systematic basis a comprehensive facility <br />that will acquire all varieties of printed material and preserve them <br />by microfilming. Ever since culture studies gained importance, one <br />problem faced by historians and social scientists is the deficiency <br />of accessible primary material. RMRL meets this demand. The idea is <br />to make it a repository of books and documents related to South <br />Indian studies, particularly the culture and social history of Tamil <br />Nadu. The long-term goal is to lin k up with all major centres of <br />learning within the country and outside. The library will also offer <br />a model to develop similar facilities to libraries in other regional <br />languages. In fact, RMRL serves as a model for South Asian cultures, <br />which have a lon g and rich history. <br /><br /><br />S.

			<div class="content">Friends,<br /><br />This library is indeed a wonder in its own right. I was infact reading up on dr.Jaybee's website(link was posted in agathiyar groups). Probably our friends in chennai, should definitely visit this library.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Nanda<br /><br /><br /><br />"s.balasubramani"  wrote:<br />website for Research oriented friends<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southasia/about-rmrl.html#Heading2">http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southa ... l#Heading2</a><!-- m --><br /><br />An archive for Tamil studies<br /><br />At the Roja Muthiah Research Library in Chennai, the private hoard of<br />an unconventional collector of printed material of all sorts forms<br />the nucleus of a major research facility focussing on South Indian<br />studies, particularly the culture and soc ial history of Tamil Nadu.<br />S. THEODORE BASKARAN<br /><br />THE value of private collections in preserving the print heritage of<br />the country has been recognised only in recent years, and there have<br />been several initiatives to make them accessible to researchers and<br />other scholars. These collections could provide a new dimension to<br />historiography, prove to be repositories of source material for<br />scholars, and enable us to understand society better.<br /><br />Inside the Roja Muthiah Research Library in Chennai. Keeping Muthiah<br />Chettiar's collection as the nucleus, the holdings of the library are<br />being expanded through additional acquisitions.<br /><br />One such attempt is the Roja Muthiah Research Library (RMRL) in<br />Chennai, the lifetime collection of an unconventional bibliophile.<br />Established in April 1994, it is emerging as a major research centre<br />for South Asian studies, especially the social and cul tural history<br />of South India.<br /><br />Muthiah Chettiar, a painter of signs, moved to Chennai from<br />Kottaiyur, a tiny village in the Chettinad region of Tamil Nadu, and<br />set up a sign board shop, Roja Arts. He had inherited from his father<br />a fascination for imprints and began collecting them. F irst he<br />bought books relating to art, particularly paintings, and gradually<br />his interest extended to other subjects. In Chennai he got to know<br />book dealers of the now defunct Moore Market, and was introduced to<br />the world of antiquarian books. He was also in touch with scrap paper<br />dealers, from whom he could get the magazines he wanted.<br /><br />With business not doing too well in Chennai, Muthiah Chettiar moved<br />back to Kottaiyur. He hoarded his treasure there in a rented building<br />adjacent to his ancestral house. At the time of his death in 1992, at<br />the age of 66, his collection had grown to nea rly 100,000 items in<br />Tamil - books, journals and single sheet material such as drama<br />notices, some of them dating back to 1886. The collection covers the<br />whole gamut of Tamil culture and heritage, and the items span a<br />period of more than 150 years, the e arliest being a book, Kandar<br />Andhathi, published in 1804.<br /><br />It was in 1975 that this writer first visited Kottaiyur and met<br />Muthiah Chettiar. By that time the fact that he had such a collection<br />was known to some researchers although none had any clear idea of<br />what it contained. Muthiah Chettiar called his collect ion India<br />Library Services.<br /><br />For consulting his books he charged a modest fee - which covered<br />coffee and lunch as well. He would give books one at a time, and at<br />times one got to browse just two books in a day. I kept in touch with<br />him and met him wheneve r he visited Chennai. He was always concerned<br />about the care of the collection after his time.<br /><br />C.S. Lakshmi (Ambai), the Tamil writer and scholar on women's<br />studies, visited Kottaiyur to use India Library Services for her<br />research on women in India. Much later, when she was at the<br />University of Chicago as a scholar-in-residence, she briefed South<br />Asia scholars there about Muthiah Chettiar's collection. The<br />university launched a global effort to save the material. It bought<br />the entire collection from the family. It had been decided that the<br />collection would remain in Tamil Nadu to form the nucleus of a<br />research library on South Indian studies, in collaboration with the<br />Chennai-based Mozhi Trust, an organisation set up to develop<br />resources for language and culture.<br /><br />Muthiah Chettiar had all varieties of printed material covering the<br />whole gamut of Tamil culture and heritage.<br />An oleograph being retrieved from storage.<br /><br />The trustees of Mozhi saw in the project scope to develop<br />systematically a comprehensive facility that would acquire all<br />varieties of printed material - both book and non-book - and conserve<br />them through preservation microfilming. James Nye, bibliographe r for<br />Southern Asia and Director of the Centre for Research Libraries at<br />the University of Chicago, and Cre-A Ramakrishnan, the innovative<br />publisher, along with P. Sankaralingam, Reader in the Library Science<br />Department of the University of Madras, went about the task of<br />setting up a digital library. From: Kottaiyur the material, packed in<br />1,110 specially designed cardboard boxes, was moved in five trucks,<br />to the library building at Mogappair in Chennai. Sankaralingam, who<br />took over as the full-time dire ctor of the library, emerged as the<br />man for the moment. His dream was to provide under one roof research<br />material and facilities for students of South Indian studies in<br />fields ranging from humanities to social sciences. He drew up a<br />project to catalogue and microfilm the collection. He set about the<br />task of organising shelving facilities, installing microfilm cameras<br />and creating machine-readable catalogue records compatible with major<br />international systems.<br /><br />In order to orient the staff to preservation microfilming, a workshop<br />was conducted in Chennai by Julio Berrios, Chief of Micrographics,<br />Library of Congress, Washington D.C. Personnel from other<br />organisations involved in similar work, such as the Tamil Nadu<br />Archives, the Theosophical Society Librar y and the Library of<br />Congress division at the United States embassy in New Delhi also<br />participated in the workshop. (Sankaralingam passed away in 1997, and<br />this writer became the Director of the library.)<br /><br />Printed material has a rather short lifetime owing to the high acid<br />content in paper. Acid reacts with the atmosphere and turns the paper<br />brown and brittle. If such material is handled frequently, it will<br />lead to further damage. So it is necessary to sto re the contents of<br />books in an archival medium. Worldwide, microfilming is the accepted<br />form of archival preservation as far as printed material is<br />concerned. If microfilm rolls are stored as per standards set by the<br />archival community, they can easily l ast for 500 years.<br /><br />Researchers can access the contents of a book through a microfilm<br />reader, instead of having to handle the original imprint. At RMRL,<br />cataloguing and microfilming are done simultaneously.<br /><br />The issue dated March 29, 1942, of Navayugam, a Tamil daily, with the<br />news of the death of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose in an <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>crash.<br /><br />In a major innovation, technologies developed by the Centre for<br />Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, have been adapted to create<br />machine-readable catalogue records. Catalogue data for Tamil items<br />are entered in Tamil script. The system in use at RMRL can display<br />and print the catalogue in Tamil script. Transliteration of the data<br />into Roman script, both for display and printing, is automatic. These<br />catalogues can be loaded into major international systems, including<br />LC MARC and OCLC, the largest bib liographic databases in the world.<br />Support for the project came in the form of grants from various<br />sources, the Wellcome Research Institute, London, the Ford<br />Foundation, and later the Government of India. Now the work of<br />cataloguing and indexing of the articles in the magazines is halfway<br />through.<br />THE strength of the library lies in the variety of subjects on which<br />Muthiah Chettiar collected books and the attention he paid to non-<br />book material and books such as theatre handbills containing film<br />songs and even some private letters. These strengths define the<br />direction in which the collection should grow. Ever since the library<br />was set up, handbills, invitations and other ephemera are being added<br />to the collection.<br /><br />A 1936 handbill publicising a drama featuring Devudu Ayyer and<br />Subbaiya Naidu among others.<br /><br />Muthiah Chettiar's collection can be classified broadly into three.<br />The first is literature, both classical and contemporary. This<br />includes devotional literature, an area that has not received much<br />attention from Indian scholars. The second category, ind igenous<br />medicine, includes classical medical books from different traditions,<br />such as Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani. For example, there is a<br />collection of aphoristic and quoted verses forming the core of Siddha<br />medicine; the complete writings attributed to Agasthiyar, and a<br />collection of Nadisastiram, the diagnostic manuals based on the<br />reading of the pulse. Traditional medicine was one of Muthiah<br />Chettiar's interests, and he himself has written a book on antidotes<br />to scorpion bite. The third set pertains to aspects of popular<br />culture such as ballads, folk songs, drama and cinema. Added to this<br />is a lot of single-sheet material, such as invitations to private<br />functions and newspaper clippings. Popular magazines of the 1930s and<br />1940s offer a rare opportun ity to researchers to chart new scholarly<br />directions. Commenting on Muthiah Chettiar's collection, a scholar<br />records: "Within his library's eclectic range of subject matter,<br />including medicine, folklore, religion, cinema and women's studies,<br />and material s such as theatre playbills and popular song books,<br />Muthiah Chettiar attempted to capture the essence of his people.<br />Scattered worldwide, about 60 million people speak Tamil."<br /><br />The song book of Harichandra Vilasam.<br /><br />There are certain works of special interest, such as the complete set<br />of 1,500 verses by Gnana Vaithiyan, which studies the interaction of<br />medical concepts with metaphysics and social issues. There is also<br />the work of Yakobu Munivar, a Tamil convert to I slam, who details in<br />his voluminous book his trip to Mecca and his introduction to the<br />Unani system of medicine there.<br />Padarthaguna Chinthamani is a book published in 1907 on the various<br />uses of local fruits, vegetables and herbs. Of particular importance<br />are the indigenous animal husbandry practices in titles such as<br />Mattuvakatam.<br />A researcher studying the freedom struggle as it manifested in south<br />India will find important material here. For instance, there are<br />Gandhian economist J.C. Kumarappa's books, translated by Kugapriyai,<br />and journals such as Sakthi, which contain numerous articles by<br />Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders such as Indulal Yagnik.<br /><br />Dr. E. Annamalai, a trustee (foreground), and<br />P. Sankaralingam, then director of RMRL, at work in the library.<br /><br />ONE important segment of the collection relates to folklore. With<br />remarkable foresight, Muthiah Chettiar acquired ballads such as<br />Desingurajan Kathai and Nallathangal Kathai, which were published by<br />the end of the 19th century. He collected differ ent versions of<br />these ballads. In fact, acquiring multiple editions of a work was<br />characteristic of him. Considered pedestrian, titles such as these<br />are not preserved in libraries. Yet ballads have come to be<br />recognised as sources of historical and liter ary information. Dr.<br />David D. Schulman, Professor of Indian Studies at the Hebrew<br />University, Jerusalem, elaborated this point in an interview<br />published in Frontline (June 10, 2000). Ballads, he says, are<br />historiographical texts that are just one stage removed from the<br />actual event. If one is sensitive to this fact, then one can discern<br />history in many genres. Several versions of subjects of traditional<br />drama, such as Harichandran Kathai, are also preserved in the<br />library.<br /><br />Cataloguing work at the library. The data system can display and<br />print catalogues in Tamil script.<br /><br />RMRL collaborates with other archives across the world. The archive<br />of the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam has<br />sent it a copy of Janamithran, a magazine brought out from Chennai in<br />1920. The Department of Communications of E dith Cowan University,<br />Perth, Australia has given a microfilm version of all volumes of the<br />Indian Cinematographic Committee Enquiry Report of 1929, including<br />the rare fifth volume. RMRL has a collaborative project with the<br />Tamil Nadu Archives and also w ith the Maraimalai Adigal Library. It<br />collaborates with the Kalachuvadu Trust in a project to document the<br />writings of Pudumaipithan, the Tamil writer. Its latest project is a<br />joint venture with the College of Arts and Crafts, Chennai.<br />Keeping Muthiah Chettiar's collection as the nucleus, the holdings of<br />the library are being expanded with additional acquisitions. A vital<br />part of its process of collection is represented by bequests of<br />printed material from scholars. The initial success of the library<br />gained acknowledgement in the form of bequests of valuable<br />collections from renowned scholars such as A.K. Ramanujam, Edward<br />Dimock and Milton Singer. Part of the collection of Gift Siromoney,<br />who was Professor of Statistics at Madras Chr istian College,<br />including his publication on the language of the Narikuravas, a<br />nomadic community of Tamil Nadu, has been received. The library has<br />received a generous donation of books on South Asian studies from<br />scholars such as Kali Charan Bahl. V. Pu rushotham, a lawyer<br />practising in the Madras High Court, whose passion is the chronology<br />of Sangam literature, has donated his collection of nearly 2,000<br />books. Almost a complete collection of the published works on the<br />Indus script is included in this c ollection. The latest donation<br />comes from Saraswathi Samman award winner Indra Parthasarathy. The<br />collection of contemporary Tamil literature includes impressive runs<br />of the works of Ka. Na. Su and Si. Su. Chellappa. One of the prized<br />imprints that have come to it through a recent bequest is<br />Uthayatharagai, the first Tamil journal printed in 1842. There are 30<br />issues now with the library.<br /><br />An old newspaper undergoing preservation procedure.<br /><br />Recently, RMRL came into possession of print material spanning the<br />War years - 1939-1945. M.S.M.M. Meyyappa Chettiar owned a film<br />distribution company, the South Indian Pictures Corporation, in<br />Chennai. During the War the company operated from Karaikudi. In June<br />1999, his grandson, Meyyappan Jr, contacted the library and offered<br />to donate a collection of magazines and documents he possessed at his<br />ancestral house at Karaikudi.

THEODORE BASKARAN<br /><br />THE value of private collections in preserving the print heritage of<br />the country has been recognised only in recent years, and there have<br />been several initiatives to make them accessible to researchers and<br />other scholars. These collections could provide a new dimension to<br />historiography, prove to be repositories of source material for<br />scholars, and enable us to understand society better.<br /><br />Inside the Roja Muthiah Research Library in Chennai. Keeping Muthiah<br />Chettiar's collection as the nucleus, the holdings of the library are<br />being expanded through additional acquisitions.<br /><br />One such attempt is the Roja Muthiah Research Library (RMRL) in<br />Chennai, the lifetime collection of an unconventional bibliophile.<br />Established in April 1994, it is emerging as a major research centre<br />for South Asian studies, especially the social and cul tural history<br />of South India.<br /><br />Muthiah Chettiar, a painter of signs, moved to Chennai from<br />Kottaiyur, a tiny village in the Chettinad region of Tamil Nadu, and<br />set up a sign board shop, Roja Arts. He had inherited from his father<br />a fascination for imprints and began collecting them. F irst he<br />bought books relating to art, particularly paintings, and gradually<br />his interest extended to other subjects. In Chennai he got to know<br />book dealers of the now defunct Moore Market, and was introduced to<br />the world of antiquarian books. He was also in touch with scrap paper<br />dealers, from whom he could get the magazines he wanted.<br /><br />With business not doing too well in Chennai, Muthiah Chettiar moved<br />back to Kottaiyur. He hoarded his treasure there in a rented building<br />adjacent to his ancestral house. At the time of his death in 1992, at<br />the age of 66, his collection had grown to nea rly 100,000 items in<br />Tamil - books, journals and single sheet material such as drama<br />notices, some of them dating back to 1886. The collection covers the<br />whole gamut of Tamil culture and heritage, and the items span a<br />period of more than 150 years, the e arliest being a book, Kandar<br />Andhathi, published in 1804.<br /><br />It was in 1975 that this writer first visited Kottaiyur and met<br />Muthiah Chettiar. By that time the fact that he had such a collection<br />was known to some researchers although none had any clear idea of<br />what it contained. Muthiah Chettiar called his collect ion India<br />Library Services.<br /><br />For consulting his books he charged a modest fee - which covered<br />coffee and lunch as well. He would give books one at a time, and at<br />times one got to browse just two books in a day. I kept in touch with<br />him and met him wheneve r he visited Chennai. He was always concerned<br />about the care of the collection after his time.<br /><br />C.S. Lakshmi (Ambai), the Tamil writer and scholar on women's<br />studies, visited Kottaiyur to use India Library Services for her<br />research on women in India. Much later, when she was at the<br />University of Chicago as a scholar-in-residence, she briefed South<br />Asia scholars there about Muthiah Chettiar's collection. The<br />university launched a global effort to save the material. It bought<br />the entire collection from the family. It had been decided that the<br />collection would remain in Tamil Nadu to form the nucleus of a<br />research library on South Indian studies, in collaboration with the<br />Chennai-based Mozhi Trust, an organisation set up to develop<br />resources for language and culture.<br /><br />Muthiah Chettiar had all varieties of printed material covering the<br />whole gamut of Tamil culture and heritage.<br />An oleograph being retrieved from storage.<br /><br />The trustees of Mozhi saw in the project scope to develop<br />systematically a comprehensive facility that would acquire all<br />varieties of printed material - both book and non-book - and conserve<br />them through preservation microfilming. James Nye, bibliographe r for<br />Southern Asia and Director of the Centre for Research Libraries at<br />the University of Chicago, and Cre-A Ramakrishnan, the innovative<br />publisher, along with P. Sankaralingam, Reader in the Library Science<br />Department of the University of Madras, went about the task of<br />setting up a digital library. From: Kottaiyur the material, packed in<br />1,110 specially designed cardboard boxes, was moved in five trucks,<br />to the library building at Mogappair in Chennai. Sankaralingam, who<br />took over as the full-time dire ctor of the library, emerged as the<br />man for the moment. His dream was to provide under one roof research<br />material and facilities for students of South Indian studies in<br />fields ranging from humanities to social sciences. He drew up a<br />project to catalogue and microfilm the collection. He set about the<br />task of organising shelving facilities, installing microfilm cameras<br />and creating machine-readable catalogue records compatible with major<br />international systems.<br /><br />In order to orient the staff to preservation microfilming, a workshop<br />was conducted in Chennai by Julio Berrios, Chief of Micrographics,<br />Library of Congress, Washington D.C. Personnel from other<br />organisations involved in similar work, such as the Tamil Nadu<br />Archives, the Theosophical Society Librar y and the Library of<br />Congress division at the United States embassy in New Delhi also<br />participated in the workshop. (Sankaralingam passed away in 1997, and<br />this writer became the Director of the library.)<br /><br />Printed material has a rather short lifetime owing to the high acid<br />content in paper. Acid reacts with the atmosphere and turns the paper<br />brown and brittle. If such material is handled frequently, it will<br />lead to further damage. So it is necessary to sto re the contents of<br />books in an archival medium. Worldwide, microfilming is the accepted<br />form of archival preservation as far as printed material is<br />concerned. If microfilm rolls are stored as per standards set by the<br />archival community, they can easily l ast for 500 years.<br /><br />Researchers can access the contents of a book through a microfilm<br />reader, instead of having to handle the original imprint. At RMRL,<br />cataloguing and microfilming are done simultaneously.<br /><br />The issue dated March 29, 1942, of Navayugam, a Tamil daily, with the<br />news of the death of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose in an <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>crash.<br /><br />In a major innovation, technologies developed by the Centre for<br />Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, have been adapted to create<br />machine-readable catalogue records. Catalogue data for Tamil items<br />are entered in Tamil script. The system in use at RMRL can display<br />and print the catalogue in Tamil script. Transliteration of the data<br />into Roman script, both for display and printing, is automatic. These<br />catalogues can be loaded into major international systems, including<br />LC MARC and OCLC, the largest bib liographic databases in the world.<br />Support for the project came in the form of grants from various<br />sources, the Wellcome Research Institute, London, the Ford<br />Foundation, and later the Government of India. Now the work of<br />cataloguing and indexing of the articles in the magazines is halfway<br />through.<br />THE strength of the library lies in the variety of subjects on which<br />Muthiah Chettiar collected books and the attention he paid to non-<br />book material and books such as theatre handbills containing film<br />songs and even some private letters. These strengths define the<br />direction in which the collection should grow. Ever since the library<br />was set up, handbills, invitations and other ephemera are being added<br />to the collection.<br /><br />A 1936 handbill publicising a drama featuring Devudu Ayyer and<br />Subbaiya Naidu among others.<br /><br />Muthiah Chettiar's collection can be classified broadly into three.<br />The first is literature, both classical and contemporary. This<br />includes devotional literature, an area that has not received much<br />attention from Indian scholars. The second category, ind igenous<br />medicine, includes classical medical books from different traditions,<br />such as Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani. For example, there is a<br />collection of aphoristic and quoted verses forming the core of Siddha<br />medicine; the complete writings attributed to Agasthiyar, and a<br />collection of Nadisastiram, the diagnostic manuals based on the<br />reading of the pulse. Traditional medicine was one of Muthiah<br />Chettiar's interests, and he himself has written a book on antidotes<br />to scorpion bite. The third set pertains to aspects of popular<br />culture such as ballads, folk songs, drama and cinema. Added to this<br />is a lot of single-sheet material, such as invitations to private<br />functions and newspaper clippings. Popular magazines of the 1930s and<br />1940s offer a rare opportun ity to researchers to chart new scholarly<br />directions. Commenting on Muthiah Chettiar's collection, a scholar<br />records: "Within his library's eclectic range of subject matter,<br />including medicine, folklore, religion, cinema and women's studies,<br />and material s such as theatre playbills and popular song books,<br />Muthiah Chettiar attempted to capture the essence of his people.<br />Scattered worldwide, about 60 million people speak Tamil."<br /><br />The song book of Harichandra Vilasam.<br /><br />There are certain works of special interest, such as the complete set<br />of 1,500 verses by Gnana Vaithiyan, which studies the interaction of<br />medical concepts with metaphysics and social issues. There is also<br />the work of Yakobu Munivar, a Tamil convert to I slam, who details in<br />his voluminous book his trip to Mecca and his introduction to the<br />Unani system of medicine there.<br />Padarthaguna Chinthamani is a book published in 1907 on the various<br />uses of local fruits, vegetables and herbs. Of particular importance<br />are the indigenous animal husbandry practices in titles such as<br />Mattuvakatam.<br />A researcher studying the freedom struggle as it manifested in south<br />India will find important material here. For instance, there are<br />Gandhian economist J.C. Kumarappa's books, translated by Kugapriyai,<br />and journals such as Sakthi, which contain numerous articles by<br />Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders such as Indulal Yagnik.<br /><br />Dr. E. Annamalai, a trustee (foreground), and<br />P. Sankaralingam, then director of RMRL, at work in the library.<br /><br />ONE important segment of the collection relates to folklore. With<br />remarkable foresight, Muthiah Chettiar acquired ballads such as<br />Desingurajan Kathai and Nallathangal Kathai, which were published by<br />the end of the 19th century. He collected differ ent versions of<br />these ballads. In fact, acquiring multiple editions of a work was<br />characteristic of him. Considered pedestrian, titles such as these<br />are not preserved in libraries. Yet ballads have come to be<br />recognised as sources of historical and liter ary information. Dr.<br />David D. Schulman, Professor of Indian Studies at the Hebrew<br />University, Jerusalem, elaborated this point in an interview<br />published in Frontline (June 10, 2000). Ballads, he says, are<br />historiographical texts that are just one stage removed from the<br />actual event. If one is sensitive to this fact, then one can discern<br />history in many genres. Several versions of subjects of traditional<br />drama, such as Harichandran Kathai, are also preserved in the<br />library.<br /><br />Cataloguing work at the library. The data system can display and<br />print catalogues in Tamil script.<br /><br />RMRL collaborates with other archives across the world. The archive<br />of the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam has<br />sent it a copy of Janamithran, a magazine brought out from Chennai in<br />1920. The Department of Communications of E dith Cowan University,<br />Perth, Australia has given a microfilm version of all volumes of the<br />Indian Cinematographic Committee Enquiry Report of 1929, including<br />the rare fifth volume. RMRL has a collaborative project with the<br />Tamil Nadu Archives and also w ith the Maraimalai Adigal Library. It<br />collaborates with the Kalachuvadu Trust in a project to document the<br />writings of Pudumaipithan, the Tamil writer. Its latest project is a<br />joint venture with the College of Arts and Crafts, Chennai.<br />Keeping Muthiah Chettiar's collection as the nucleus, the holdings of<br />the library are being expanded with additional acquisitions. A vital<br />part of its process of collection is represented by bequests of<br />printed material from scholars. The initial success of the library<br />gained acknowledgement in the form of bequests of valuable<br />collections from renowned scholars such as A.K. Ramanujam, Edward<br />Dimock and Milton Singer. Part of the collection of Gift Siromoney,<br />who was Professor of Statistics at Madras Chr istian College,<br />including his publication on the language of the Narikuravas, a<br />nomadic community of Tamil Nadu, has been received. The library has<br />received a generous donation of books on South Asian studies from<br />scholars such as Kali Charan Bahl. V. Pu rushotham, a lawyer<br />practising in the Madras High Court, whose passion is the chronology<br />of Sangam literature, has donated his collection of nearly 2,000<br />books. Almost a complete collection of the published works on the<br />Indus script is included in this c ollection. The latest donation<br />comes from Saraswathi Samman award winner Indra Parthasarathy. The<br />collection of contemporary Tamil literature includes impressive runs<br />of the works of Ka. Na. Su and Si. Su. Chellappa. One of the prized<br />imprints that have come to it through a recent bequest is<br />Uthayatharagai, the first Tamil journal printed in 1842. There are 30<br />issues now with the library.<br /><br />An old newspaper undergoing preservation procedure.<br /><br />Recently, RMRL came into possession of print material spanning the<br />War years - 1939-1945. M.S.M.M. Meyyappa Chettiar owned a film<br />distribution company, the South Indian Pictures Corporation, in<br />Chennai. During the War the company operated from Karaikudi. In June<br />1999, his grandson, Meyyappan Jr, contacted the library and offered<br />to donate a collection of magazines and documents he possessed at his<br />ancestral house at Karaikudi. The RMRL team set out promptly and<br />brought in the hoard, which included seven dailies, 12 magazines from<br />the War period, song books and publicity brochures, and a near<br />complete set of the acts and rules relating to the film industry that<br />were enforced during the British period. For instance, the government<br />had passed an order tha t as a measure of economy the length of a<br />film should not exceed 11,000 feet. If a film-maker made a film<br />supporting the War, then preference was given in the supply of raw<br />stock. This order is in the form of a booklet. Recently, RMRL located<br />the collect ion of freedom fighter Covai Ayyamuthu in Pollachi, and<br />microfilmed the titles. There are other private collections too,<br />though not as large as Muthiah Chettiar's, scattered in various parts<br />of Tamil Nadu. Work is on to create a network of these collecti ons<br />in order to provide better access to more extensive Tamil source<br />material.<br />Although microfilming is considered to be the answer for long-term<br />storage, for short-term use and quick retrieval, scholars prefer the<br />digital medium. Apart from the flat-bed scanner used for scanning<br />paper material, the library has acquired a state-of- the-art<br />microfilm digital-scanning equipment. Using this, microfilm can be<br />scanned and the images can be either stored on compact disks (CDs)<br />and digital video disks (DVDs) or the images can be made accessible<br />through cyberspace. The equipment is capable of producing high-<br />quality images that can be transferred even for the purpose of<br />publishing.<br /><br /><br />Exposed microfilm being checked for quality before being stored.<br /><br />RMRL aims to develop on a systematic basis a comprehensive facility<br />that will acquire all varieties of printed material and preserve them<br />by microfilming. Ever since culture studies gained importance, one<br />problem faced by historians and social scientists is the deficiency<br />of accessible primary material. RMRL meets this demand. The idea is<br />to make it a repository of books and documents related to South<br />Indian studies, particularly the culture and social history of Tamil<br />Nadu. The long-term goal is to lin k up with all major centres of<br />learning within the country and outside. The library will also offer<br />a model to develop similar facilities to libraries in other regional<br />languages. In fact, RMRL serves as a model for South Asian cultures,<br />which have a lon g and rich history.<br /><br />S.
