			<div class="content">Venketesh,<br /><br />My point was that one can arouse feelings of nationalism in others by<br />recounting tales of "nationalism"/bravery from another era. Just because the<br />nationalism implied in Kalki's historical novels were not the same as the<br />Freedom Era pan-India nationalism does not imply that it was somehow less<br />in spirit. I think we both agree that Kalki did try and get the tamils to<br />feel pride in their history/culture/language and by doing this, in trying to<br />enthuse and arouse their spirits for the larger fight against the British<br />Empire.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 11/7/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-Hi<br /> <br />  okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could such a book have<br />  given in times of an independence struggle? &#40; or for the matter in a<br />  freshly independent country&#41;<br /> <br />  did it not enforce what the british were telling us all along. that<br />  india was full of warring tribes which they and they only united and<br />  if they left everything would go back to chaos.<br /> <br />  the individual nationalism is still alive even in this group.try<br />  talking to rahul dhinakaran about chola superiority and expecta mile<br />  long mail denying it.<br /> <br />  whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was that " we were not<br />  always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and those before us<br />  were brave in battle. not docile like us.<br /> <br />  regards<br />  venketesh<br /> <br />  -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Arun Krishnan"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    I think Nationalism has to be seen in the context of the time that<br />  the story<br />    is set in. Nationalism in our current time means the geopgraphical<br />  entity of<br />    India. In the Chola/Chera/Pandya/Pallava times, nationalism meant a<br />  love for<br />    the respective kingdoms. In that sense VanthiyathevAn etc were Chola<br />    nationalists while even Ravidasan and co were Pandya nationalists.<br />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />   <br />    Cheers,<br />   <br />    Arun<br />   <br />    On 11/6/06, Deepa Prakash  wrote:<br />     <br />      Must have been fun looking for a hill that looks like<br />      a deer:&#41;<br />      I too get compeletely mesmerised by Kalki&#39;s works<br />     <br />     <br />      --- Sivaram Kannan <br />  wrote:<br />     <br />       <br />        Sir,<br />       <br />        Kalki&#39;s forte was his ability to mix facts with the<br />        fiction. I remember one particular story well. It<br />        is called poimaan karadu. It is about a illusion in<br />        a hill that looks like a deer at some place near<br />        Namakkal.

Just because the<br />  nationalism implied in Kalki&#39;s historical novels<br />  were not the same as the<br />  Freedom Era pan-India nationalism does not imply<br />  that it was somehow less<br />  in spirit. I think we both agree that Kalki did try<br />  and get the tamils to<br />  feel pride in their history/culture/language and by<br />  doing this, in trying to<br />  enthuse and arouse their spirits for the larger<br />  fight against the British<br />  Empire.<br /> <br />  Cheers,<br /> <br />  Arun<br /> <br />  On 11/7/06, R.venketesh <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    -Hi<br />   <br />    okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could<br />  such a book have<br />    given in times of an independence struggle? &#40; or<br />  for the matter in a<br />    freshly independent country&#41;<br />   <br />    did it not enforce what the british were telling<br />  us all along. that<br />    india was full of warring tribes which they and<br />  they only united and<br />    if they left everything would go back to chaos.<br />   <br />    the individual nationalism is still alive even in<br />  this group.try<br />    talking to rahul dhinakaran about chola<br />  superiority and expecta mile<br />    long mail denying it.<br />   <br />    whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was<br />  that " we were not<br />    always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and<br />  those before us<br />    were brave in battle. not docile like us.<br />   <br />    regards<br />    venketesh<br />   <br />    -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  ,<br />    "Arun Krishnan"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      I think Nationalism has to be seen in the<br />  context of the time that<br />    the story<br />      is set in.

			<div class="content">Dear Venkatesh and SPS,<br />Very good start on later Cholas.<br />1. Individual worship, not national pride, may be main reason for falling of Cholas. The integration between small states and centre created by the great Raja Raja was completely destroyed during the period of later cholas.<br /><br />2. No major wars between Cholas and their erstwhile enemies after Kulottungan period. Even Chalukya Vikramathitya VI, the dangerous enemy of Cholas too kept quite after AD 1000. Sinhala has gone to Sinhalas during Kulottungan time itself. Not much was in Srilanka afterwards between Tamils and Lankans. So, war culture was limited during later cholas time. And in-fighting started between main chieftians - example Kopperunginkan who built THILLAI Gopurams.<br /><br />3. Because there was no major wars and peace prevailed we have got more classical works in Tamil during their time (one great asset to Tamils).<br /><br />4. Rajaraja & Rajendra behaved like humble persons and not like dictators. But it was not there during later chola time. The later Cholas behaved like more than Dictators (Ref. Kalingattu Parani - Kulottunga put his leg on the head of friendly country chieftian - and one of the last chola put his leg on head of Pandya King at Madurai Palace. Any such dictatorship can not last long.<br /><br />But If Raja Raja's Policy of central governance with democratic set up over rural continued, there was no doubt that chola supremacy would have been very longer period.<br />Anbudan<br />Dhivakar<br />"R.venketesh"  wrote:<br />Hi<br /><br />the reign of the last cholas. correct the figures if they are wrong.<br /><br />Kulothunga Chola I 1070-1120<br /><br />Rajendra Chola III 1246-1279<br /><br />so kulothunga onwards the cholas have ruled for 200 years<br /><br />before them from vijayalaya( 848) to athirajenthra (1070) 222 years.<br /><br />so the transition has come half way only.<br /><br />did the slow down start because of inner rot or was it due to external<br />factors.<br /><br />was there any major invasion of chola land after kulothunga?<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br />-- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />  wrote:<br /> <br />   <br />      And cleverly he has not taken <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or post <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> period.
