			<div class="content">*An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture<br /><br />It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish company. Working for them<br />has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here takes 2 years<br />to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. It's a rule.<br /><br />Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the world) a general sense<br />of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to posses a need<br />to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow movements of<br />the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x<br />quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, this<br />always yields better results.<br /><br />Said in another words:<br />1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br />2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its renowned<br />companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.<br /><br />The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up at the<br />hotel every morning. It was September, <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> cold and snowy. We would arrive<br />early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance (2000<br />employees drive their car to work). The first day, I didn't say anything,<br />either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a fixed<br />parking space? I've noticed we park far from the entrance even when there<br />are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we're here early<br />we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and need a<br />place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine my face.<br /><br />Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This movement<br />establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough time to<br />taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without rushing. Slow<br />Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what it stands<br />for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement called Slow<br />Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.<br /><br />Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and "craziness"<br />generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in quantity"<br />(life status) versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the "quality<br />of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, are more<br />productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 hour<br />workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. This slow<br />attitude has brought forth the US's attention, pupils of the fast and the<br />"do it now!".<br /><br />This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less or having a lower<br />productivity. It means working and doing things with greater quality,<br />productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. It means<br />reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. Taking the<br />"now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and anonymous.<br />It means taking humans' essential values, the simplicity of living.<br /><br />It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter and more<br />productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do. It's time<br />to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality with<br />no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products and<br />services, without losing the essence of spirit.<br /><br />In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene where Al Pacino asks a girl<br />to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend will be here any minute<br />now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". Then they dance<br />to a tango.<br /><br />Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach it when we<br />die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time. Others are<br />so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the present, which<br />is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time throughout the<br />world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each one of us<br />does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon said, *"Life<br />is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".<br />*Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There are many<br />who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this<br />globalized world.</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Sivakumar,<br /><br />That is VERY VERY INTERESTING AND OPT MESSAGE.<br /><br />There have been Corporate Sogans too:<br /><br />1. WE ARE SLOW, BUT SURE.<br />2. WE ARE SILENT BECAUSE WE ARE SOUND.<br /><br />As rightly pointed Slow does not mean sacrificing anything .. Very slow<br />is a different matter.<br /><br />And that John Lennon (Beatles) quote "while you are planning Life is<br />happening" is a wonderful much talked about Quote ...<br /><br />And I do wish to look into myself for an answer to look at my attidue<br />to my fellow citizen to compare with your friend's that other's may have<br />not time to walk....<br /><br />Very nice posting..<br /><br />Thank you so much..<br /><br />Best regards/<br /><br />sps</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="muncited"><div>*An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture</div></blockquote>Very good mail.<br /><br />There is a proverb in tibet:<br />"If you want to go to a place quickly - walk slowly<br />If you want to go to a place damn fast - walk very slowly"<br /><br />This is to tell that walk slowly towords your ambitions and goals<br />without missing the fun of life<br /><br />This means your journey is as interesting or even more interesting<br />than your destination<br /><br />There are many stories in zen buddhism which stress this central<br />concept in many ways<br /><br />Osho has dealt with it in a brilliant manner. He goes to the very<br />depth of the philosophy of time and why west caught up with this<br />concept of fast life. No offence meant to our christian friends - but<br />he actually says that it was mainly because of a fundamental concept<br />about time in christianity.<br /><br />In hinduism & buddhism (and even jainism) you have come here - to this<br />world - many times. And you will come many more times. So there is no<br />hurry. You are finishing off some of the things that were left undone<br />during your last visit. It is a long and wonderful journey. Your<br />journey does not end with your physical death. You have another<br />chance. Hence you have lot of time.<br /><br />But the christian faith is different. You come here only once. There<br />is no chance for coming here again. Hence it puts lot of pressure on<br />humans. There is so much that needs to be done in ones life and very<br />little time left ! Hence everything needs to be done within a span of<br />60 to 80 years. Hurry up ! And as western philosophy spread across the<br />world this concept spread all over.<br /><br />And alas ! Now, it is in the land of buddhism - china / japan etc -<br />where the culture of working more than 40 hours a week is well<br />established ! And it is now in the christian world that slowing down<br />is being looked at seriously.<br /><br />The good thing about globalization and shrinking world is that humans<br />all over have started looking at other cultures.Time tested<br />philosophies are undergoing massive transformation<br /><br />We are living in an interesting era<br /><br />Love<br />G</div>

One thing heavily pulling down India is her<br />economic status. Globalization really trying to pull<br />us out of this misery. Unless some real, urgent and<br />rapid efforts are made the economic gap with the rest<br />of the world will remain big if not growing bigger.<br /><br />Our excellent intellectual and hidden wealths are now<br />being cleaned out of rust and we are coming out of the<br />thick dark economic ignorance. Globalization scrapes<br />out these unwanted coverings at least at some sectors.<br /><br />A harsh comparison comes to my mind. Your article<br />reminds me a healthy man sitting in front of a full<br />plantain leaf served with a hundred dishes along with<br />a dozen appetizers and a dozen deserts. A little away<br />I am sitting in front of a stitched leaf served with<br />curd rice and lemon pickles.

But when the focus is shifted to Globalisation - the <br />plantain leaf example well tossed by our dear friend Natarajan <br />obviously stares at us.<br /><br />Further dimensions related to India's (Venkat will ask where was it <br />before the British?) past Glory will be more spicy too.<br /><br />Then as Sivakumar replied it need not be in all the spheres ..<br /><br />Very interesting views generated.. <br /><br />thank you both..<br /><br />best regards / sps<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivakumar K.N." <br /> wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Natarajan,<br />  <br />  That article was a Forward.

No quick fixes.<br />  <br />  I agree that developed countries can afford to take time.We may <br />have to run<br />  fast till we reach that stage - again, this need not be in all<br />  spheres/industries.<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  Sivakumar<br />  On 2/15/07, NATARAJAN SRINIVASAN  wrote:<br />   <br />    Dear Sivakumar,<br />   <br />    Slow down culture is a well written article<br />    describing a good way of living. While appreciating<br />    your sincere motive behind writing this article I wish<br />    to record my quick provocations after reading this<br />    article.<br />   <br />    Please note my comments are pertaining to the<br />    attempts to criticize globalization.<br />   <br />    India is a well deserved country to be in the top of<br />    the world. One thing heavily pulling down India is her<br />    economic status. Globalization really trying to pull<br />    us out of this misery. Unless some real, urgent and<br />    rapid efforts are made the economic gap with the rest<br />    of the world will remain big if not growing bigger.<br />   <br />    Our excellent intellectual and hidden wealths are now<br />    being cleaned out of rust and we are coming out of the<br />    thick dark economic ignorance. Globalization scrapes<br />    out these unwanted coverings at least at some sectors.<br />   <br />    A harsh comparison comes to my mind. Your article<br />    reminds me a healthy man sitting in front of a full<br />    plantain leaf served with a hundred dishes along with<br />    a dozen appetizers and a dozen deserts. A little away<br />    I am sitting in front of a stitched leaf served with<br />    curd rice and lemon pickles. The first man really has<br />    his own choice of eating at his own pace.<br />   <br />    Before deciding the pace at which we have to<br />    eat we must sit in the same row of full plantain<br />    leaves. I hope globalization makes us to inch towards<br />    this place.<br />   <br />    Natarajan.<br />   <br />    --- "Sivakumar K.N." <br />    wrote:<br />   <br />      *An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture<br />     <br />      It&#39;s been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish<br />      company.

Volvo supplies the NASA.<br />     <br />      The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues<br />      picked me up at the<br />      hotel every morning. It was September, <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> cold and<br />      snowy. We would arrive<br />      early at the company and he would park far away from<br />      the entrance &#40;2000<br />      employees drive their car to work&#41;. The first day, I<br />      didn&#39;t say anything,<br />      either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do<br />      you have a fixed<br />      parking space? I&#39;ve noticed we park far from the<br />      entrance even when there<br />      are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied,<br />      "Since we&#39;re here early<br />      we&#39;ll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late<br />      will be late and need a<br />      place closer to the door. Don&#39;t you think? Imagine<br />      my face.<br />     <br />      Nowadays, there&#39;s a movement in Europe name Slow<br />      Food. This movement<br />      establishes that people should eat and drink slowly,<br />      with enough time to<br />      taste their food, spend time with the family,<br />      friends, without rushing. Slow<br />      Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast<br />      Food and what it stands<br />      for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a<br />      bigger movement called Slow<br />      Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.<br />     <br />      Basically, the movement questions the sense of<br />      "hurry" and "craziness"<br />      generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of<br />      "having in quantity"<br />      &#40;life status&#41; versus "having with quality", "life<br />      quality" or the "quality<br />      of being". French people, even though they work 35<br />      hours per week, are more<br />      productive than Americans or British. Germans have<br />      established 28.8 hour<br />      workweeks and have seen their productivity been<br />      driven up by 20%. This slow<br />      attitude has brought forth the US&#39;s attention,<br />      pupils of the fast and the<br />      "do it now!".<br />     <br />      This no-rush attitude doesn&#39;t represent doing less<br />      or having a lower<br />      productivity. It means working and doing things with<br />      greater quality,<br />      productivity, perfection, with attention to detail<br />      and less stress. It means<br />      reestablishing family values, friends, free and<br />      leisure time. Taking the<br />      "now", present and concrete, versus the "global",<br />      undefined and anonymous.<br />      It means taking humans&#39; essential values, the<br />      simplicity of living.<br />     <br />      It stands for a less coercive work environment, more<br />      happy, lighter and more<br />      productive where humans enjoy doing what they know<br />      best how to do. It&#39;s time<br />      to stop and think on how companies need to develop<br />      serious quality with<br />      no-rush that will increase productivity and the<br />      quality of products and<br />      services, without losing the essence of spirit.<br />     <br />      In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there&#39;s a scene<br />      where Al Pacino asks a girl<br />      to dance and she replies, "I can&#39;t, my boyfriend<br />      will be here any minute<br />      now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an<br />      instant". Then they dance<br />      to a tango.<br />     <br />      Many of us live our lives running behind time, but<br />      we only reach it when we<br />      die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing<br />      to be on time. Others are<br />      so anxious of living the future that they forget to<br />      live the present, which<br />      is the only time that truly exists. We all have<br />      equal time throughout the<br />      world. No one has more or less. The difference lies<br />      in how each one of us<br />      does with our time. We need to live each moment.
