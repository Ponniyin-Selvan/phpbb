			<div class="content">Satish, look at it from a practical standpoint. The pandavs were not even true cousins - they were born to Kunti and others. Yudhistra willingly participated in the dice game and lost all.Granted some injustice was done but what warrantied that degree of bloodshed? What was the fallout of the war? All of the pandavs children died in the fire. All of yadavas died due to Gandhari&#39;s curse - so Krishna has karma too, right? What exactly was Sri krishna trying to prove with a big war, it baffles me. We can of course do reverse justification, he was God and therefore he knew his reasons which mortals don&#39;t. Perhaps. But sometimes that does feel lame, why couldn&#39;t he have resolved it without blooshed or with less blodshd? I think it isimportant to ask all these questions even if we don&#39;t know answers. Otherwise our children will or kudharka vaadhis like dk ites will.more later,sorry not enough time.<br /><br />SatishKumar Arunachalam wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com , Malathi Mahadevan  <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />   Â  <br />   The actions of the Mahabharat therefore led to more bad karma, not <br />  less.

Initially the rishi feels why I am asked to learn from a<br />butcher, what quality he has but kills innocent lives. The butcher on<br />the other had never feels that he is killing lives, but does it<br />without any attachment as Karma yoga and does his duty without<br />expecting anything, and thus realizes brahman.<br /><br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Satish, yes the land was not returned, but again does that warranty sucha bloody war? Yes the count is mind boggling but are we looking at same numbers as our present numeric system? The Ramayana for example says Dasaratha ruled 16,000 years, is it humanly possible? And there is little/no evidence that there was population explosion. In fact both Yudhistir and Duryodhana supposedly ruled over very prosperous kingdoms.<br />Â <br />There is another way of looking at this whole thing - from Duryodhana's perspective. My grandmother said there used to be several street plays and folk narratives of the Mahabharat from various perspective that disappeard over time. One of them is like this - Duryodhana was not legally obligated to share any part of his kingdom with the pandavas, since they were not his birth cousins only half cousins. From childhood the elders and family memberswere partial to the pandavas since Pandu died young and the five children were very accomplished. That instigated anger in Duryodhana who in turn grew up to be a vengeful, resentful prince and refuses to see the Pandavas as his equals. <br />Â <br />As far as Krishna not wanting the war, Krishna was the chess player in the whole game who moved the dice at will, not a blind follower of what each person did ? That is exactly what Gandhari asks him before cursing him and his tribe. You could have stopped it if you willed so. Why did he not will so?Â  Perhaps we will never know the answers.<br />Â <br />I have attended numerous discourses and talks on the Mahabharat. The late Pulavar Keeran was just amazing. I love the story very much so, am also aware of its pitfalls, [particularly with an increasingly aware generation of youngsters. (MyÂ 11 year old niece asked me a question - if Kamsa did not want his sister to have the 8th child why did he not put her and her husbandin separate jails. <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />). In our time and age kids did not think that way atall.)<br />Â <br />I narrate the Mahabharat as a collection of short stories. It makes huge sense that way. Not as one long story with pandavas as heroes and kauravas asvillians. It does not add up to that and it probably was a lot of differntstories collected over time. Â And the puranas have little/no connection with vedic ways of living or clear cut definitions of karma. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br />Â <br /><br /><br />--- On Wed, 8/20/08, SatishKumar Arunachalam  wrote: <br /><br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, August 20, 2008, 12:27 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />very true.

			<div class="content">Sundar, I had forgotten that part about the chariot touching the ground!! Thanks really for refreshing. I don't agree with the punishment in principle, one of the other pandavas would have done it if Yudhistir refused, in general the person who instigates a crime is more at fault than one who commits it (I can understand Sri Krishna genuinely testing someone if or not he is a liar but that wasn't the case here so it does not make sense that is all).<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Wed, 8/20/08, Sundar  wrote: <br /><br />From: Sundar <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, August 20, 2008, 7:18 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Malalthi<br />Yudhishtra was punished because he was knowingly part that plot.When Drona's hears about Aswathamma's death, he wanted that to confirm only with Yudishtra becuase he would not go against Dharma. Having anticipated this, Krishna plooted this way and Yudhistra when saying 'hatha' lowered his voice andthe sound of the conch drowned it. Yudhishtra's chariot which always remain an inch or so above the ground, becuase of his virtues, touched the groundÂ on thatÂ moment of deceit.<br />Â <br />Regards<br />Sundar<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Malathi Mahadevan <br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Sent: Wednesday, August 20, 2008 3:21:44 PM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sundar, why would Yudhistir be punished for killing Drona? Yudhistir was a very truthful man who refuses to lie that Ashwattama died, even at Krishna's instigation. So Bhima kills an elephant named Aswattama and asks Yudhistir to announce 'Ashwattama hatha kunjaraha' - Krishna resourcefully sounds his conch at the word 'hatha' (elephant) so poor Drona hears 'Aswattama Kunjaraha' , thinks it is his son who died and renounces his arms . It is deceit at its diplomatic best. If anyone has to be punished it is Bhima perhaps not Yudhisthir.<br />Â <br />Â <br />Ashwattama is furious that his father was killed in this fashion and plots the tent fire. Yes it is an eye for an eye, what else does war instigate?<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br /><br />--- <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />42: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The last chapter of the Mahabharat actually talks about Duryodhana in heaven and the Pandavas in hell paying for their karma......<br />Â <br />Hi<br />This is wrongly interpreted. WhenÂ Yudhishtra enters heaven, he was shocked to see all the Kauravas there and Pandavas in hell. It wasÂ very brief and in that brief moment he expeienced hell. Then the scene reversed and he found allÂ the pandavas in heaven. This was the punishmentÂ to Yudhishtrafor the Ashwatama episode where he was forced to suppress the truth to kill Drona.<br />Â <br />Â <br />Â <br />The pandavas actually lose all their progeny except one in the great fire that Dhristhadyumna sets to their tent.<br />Â <br />ActuallyÂ it was AshwatamaÂ  and gang who sets the tent on fire where allthe Pandava siblings die. <br />Â <br />Sundar</div>
