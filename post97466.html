			<div class="content">posting this interesting note for Prof JB from agathiar.<br /><br /><br /><br />When I was working in the State of Kelantan in the<br />East Coast of Malaya, I was posted to the General Hospital of<br />the State capital called Kota Bahru.<br />I was taking a very active part in politics, in religious<br />activities and youth activities at that time. I was closely <br />associated<br />with ministers; I founded the Malaysia Hindu Sangam of Kelantan State<br />and was its first president. I was the founder and co-ordinator of<br />Tamil Youth Bell Club for the States of Trengganu and Kelantan.<br />Anyone coming to Kelantan would make it a point to visit me<br />and spend time with me, especially the Indian VIP's.<br />One day I received a letter from one Swamiji about<br />another Swamiji. He was from ThirukkuLambur.<br />On the stipulated day, he arrived.<br />But he was far from looking like a Swamiji.<br /><br /><br />He had a rugged and rustic look. He was wearing a silk jibba<br />and eight mulza veshti. He had an angavasthram. His hair was grown<br />upto the nape of his neck into a type of Baghavathar Crop. He had<br />a thick bristling moustache. There were streaks of grey in his hair<br />and moustache. He was tall and well-built. The complexion was dark.<br />His eyes were large and bulging and his vision was divergent.<br />He looked more like a Rasputin without beard.<br />He looked like having arrived from some medieval times by<br />a time-machine.<br />He stayed in our house for more than a month. But this was the<br />beginning of a friendship which lasted for several years. He made<br />several trips from India and followed us to several places wherever<br />we went.<br />His name was Alzagu Ramaiyya. He said that he belonged to<br />a branch of the Cholzas. In fact, he had a family name - 'Cholzagar'.<br />He had a strange story to tell.<br />When he was young, he was a rowdy. He used to play pranks.<br />One day he was sleeping in a KaLi temple. He had a dream in<br />which KaLi appeared and asked him to drink a small vessel of honey.<br />She also wrote some atcharam on his tongue with Her Trisulam.<br />From: then onwards, he could sing poems and verses in<br />Chenthamilz.<br />The noteworthy thing here, is that, he was illiterate.<br />When he received letters from India, he would ask one of us<br />to read them for him. And somebody would have to write his letters<br />for him.<br />But yet, he sang songs and poems like a versatile poet. And<br />he could speak in clear well-versed Tamil. He could give speeches<br />in good Tamil. And he would speak about religion, spirituality, and<br />ithihasas and puranas.<br />So we named him 'The Kavirayar'.<br />But he preferred to call himself by another name -<br />'Kalai Maa Muni'.<br /><br />About the Kavirayar belonging to the Cholza clan.......<br /><br />The Cholzas have a legendary history from the dim past.<br />Manunidhi Cholzan, Sibi, and some others have a remote past.<br />During the third Sangam, we come across Karikalan,<br />NalangiLLi, NalangiLLi, an several others. Karikaalan's many<br />descendants started several royal dynasties in India and South<br />East Asia.<br />They were dormant for 600 years. We come across<br />KopperunchOlzan, and the father of Mangayarkkarasi wife of<br />NerumARa Pandyan, and a few others.<br /><br />The Cholzas were under the Pallavas. In the frequent wars<br />waged by the Pallavas and the Pandyas, the Cholzas took sides.<br />Then when both the overlords wore themselves out, the Cholzas<br />took over from the Pallavas. Then they overcame the Pandyas<br />and conquered a large territory. Thus the Imperial Cholzas came<br />into being. RajaRaja and Rajendra belong to this line.<br /><br />In 1216, Maravaraman Sundara Pandya I over-ran the<br />Chola Empire during the rule of Kuloththunga III. Soon after<br />the defeat, Kuloththunga died. His son RajaRaja III came to<br />the throne. But during the war, he was imprisoned by his own<br />feudatory, Kopperunjingga of Thirukkovaluur.<br />Due to the intervention of the Hoysala emperor of<br />Mysore, who happened to be RajaRaja's father-in-law,<br />MS Pandya gave back the Chola Mandala to RajaRaja III.<br />But something happened. So MS Pandya attacked again in<br />1246. Soon after that MSPandya died and two kings came<br />to power in quick succession. They were weak. The Hoysala<br />NaraSimha made use of this opportunity because by this time<br />he had become the father-in-law of Maravarman Sundara<br />Pandya II also. So he extended his territory from Mysore<br />right across Coimbatore, Dindigal, and Tiruchi where he built<br />a huge fortress at Samayapuram.<br />Thus he craeted a Hoysala wedge in Tamilnadu,<br />effectively separating the Cholzas in the north and the<br />Pandyas in the south.<br /><br />The last Chola emperor belonging to the Imperial Cholas<br />was Rajendra III. He came to the throne in 1256 A.D. He was<br />the son of RajaRaja III.<br /><br />He defeated MS Pandya II in a war. But the Hoysala<br />took the Pandiyan side this time, to prevent a revival of<br />Cholziyan Imperialism. But Jatavarman Sundara Pandya, the<br />greatest conqueror among the later Pandyas came to power<br />in 1251.<br /><br />He started on an expansionist policy and conquered Chera,<br />Chola,Ceylon and the Telugu Choda territories and also got rid<br />of the Hoysalas.<br /><br />But JS Pandya died in 1268 and was succeeded by<br />Maravarman Kulasekhara Pandya, the last of the Grand Pandyas.<br /><br />There was a last major war in which Rajendra III allied<br />himself with Hoysala Ramanatha, the son of Narasimha. But this<br />grand alliance was totally defeated by MKPandya.<br />This war took place in 1279.<br />And that is the last that we hear of Rajendra III and<br />the Cholas.<br />There is a group of people belonging to a particular<br />community. They claim to be the descendants of the Cholas.<br />Until about 40 years ago, one of the families belonging to<br />this community used to hold a symbolic coronation ceremony<br />in the Chidhambaram Temple just as their fore-runners did.<br /><br />The Kavirayar belongs to one of the kudis of this clan of<br />people. They call themselves 'Cholzagar' which is occassionally<br />used as a title.<br /><br />He had the help of a deity who used to do his bidding.<br />The deity carried a weapon called 'uLi' and used to ride a horse.<br />I am concealing his name. This is a different deity. Not the one<br />that you think.<br />There were also other deities whom he would invoke at times.<br />Also some spirits which would come to him when called.<br />Normally he would apply high quality perfumes. He is<br />seldom without them. But there were times when some bad odour<br />would be around when he is involved in doing some 'kalzichchal'<br />for somebody.<br />But when he passes into the Kavirayar personality, he does<br />not do all this type of work.<br />It was in 1984.<br />I was in a place called Kota Tinggi. The Kavirayar had come<br />to a place called Malacca on his own. He was staying at someone's<br />house. But his frequent pujais disturbed the household very much<br />and they sent him to Kota Tinggi. We made him stay in a room on<br />his own with its own bathroom. It was an old type of British Bungalow<br />quarters. Windows with slit-like shutters and huge doors.<br />After he came to Kota Tinggi, the time came for him to<br />renew his visa.<br />But to his horror, he could not find the passport and other<br />documents. He said that he had placed them in a brown paper<br />envelope and had kept in his 'trunkupetti'.<br />But it was not there.<br />He was very upset.<br />The next morning, he got up very early and took a bath.<br />Without combing his hair and wearing only a towel on his waist,<br />he smeared his arms and fore-head and his chest and belly<br />with kunkumam.<br />Then he jumped and said, "$%#@ *&$3 avanukkaachchu<br />enakkaachchu.....&%$# paaththuppuduvONdaa.....@##$%".<br />He liberally used foul words when he was not in the Kavirayar<br />personality.<br />Then he sat on a sofa in the hall and refused to talk anything<br />nor eat anything.<br />He was unusually silent.<br />Suddenly he jumped up.<br />There was a sound of commotion outside his room.<br />I saw something being dropped through the slit in the window<br />frame-work. Then there was a noise of somebody running away. And<br />there was the sound of hoofs. Horses hoofs.<br />There are no horses anywhere near Kota Tinggi.<br />The Kavirayar was jumping and ran towards the noise shouting,<br />"pidraa avaney..... pidraa...pirdraa....pidraa!"<br />We all rushed outside.<br />There was nothing there. Nobody.<br />No foot marks.<br />And no hoof-marks.<br />The Kavirayar ran back into the house.<br />He picked up the object that had dropped through the window.<br />It was a brown envelope.<br />Inside it, was the passport and all the documents.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />JayBee<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, nithya pillai <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hiiii.....<br />  anyone heard about reborn of ponniyin selvar with his<br />  identity sangu chakara regai.......<br />  do u belive in that??????<br />  nithi<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Get the freedom to save as many mails as you wish.

			<div class="content">Dear Vijay,<br />The JB note on 'kAVIRAYAR' was quite interesting. For everything and for every incident we have no answer of proof. We have several such incidents happening in South India too but when you search for authentic sources, nothing we would get. And That is India.<br />Dhivakar.<br /><br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote:<br />posting this interesting note for Prof JB from agathiar.<br /><br />When I was working in the State of Kelantan in the<br />East Coast of Malaya, I was posted to the General Hospital of<br />the State capital called Kota Bahru.<br />I was taking a very active part in politics, in religious<br />activities and youth activities at that time. I was closely<br />associated<br />with ministers; I founded the Malaysia Hindu Sangam of Kelantan State<br />and was its first president. I was the founder and co-ordinator of<br />Tamil Youth Bell Club for the States of Trengganu and Kelantan.<br />Anyone coming to Kelantan would make it a point to visit me<br />and spend time with me, especially the Indian VIP's.<br />One day I received a letter from one Swamiji about<br />another Swamiji. He was from ThirukkuLambur.<br />On the stipulated day, he arrived.<br />But he was far from looking like a Swamiji.<br /><br />He had a rugged and rustic look. He was wearing a silk jibba<br />and eight mulza veshti. He had an angavasthram. His hair was grown<br />upto the nape of his neck into a type of Baghavathar Crop. He had<br />a thick bristling moustache. There were streaks of grey in his hair<br />and moustache. He was tall and well-built. The complexion was dark.<br />His eyes were large and bulging and his vision was divergent.<br />He looked more like a Rasputin without beard.<br />He looked like having arrived from some medieval times by<br />a time-machine.<br />He stayed in our house for more than a month. But this was the<br />beginning of a friendship which lasted for several years. He made<br />several trips from India and followed us to several places wherever<br />we went.<br />His name was Alzagu Ramaiyya. He said that he belonged to<br />a branch of the Cholzas. In fact, he had a family name - 'Cholzagar'.<br />He had a strange story to tell.<br />When he was young, he was a rowdy. He used to play pranks.<br />One day he was sleeping in a KaLi temple. He had a dream in<br />which KaLi appeared and asked him to drink a small vessel of honey.<br />She also wrote some atcharam on his tongue with Her Trisulam.<br />From: then onwards, he could sing poems and verses in<br />Chenthamilz.<br />The noteworthy thing here, is that, he was illiterate.<br />When he received letters from India, he would ask one of us<br />to read them for him. And somebody would have to write his letters<br />for him.<br />But yet, he sang songs and poems like a versatile poet. And<br />he could speak in clear well-versed Tamil. He could give speeches<br />in good Tamil. And he would speak about religion, spirituality, and<br />ithihasas and puranas.<br />So we named him 'The Kavirayar'.<br />But he preferred to call himself by another name -<br />'Kalai Maa Muni'.<br /><br />About the Kavirayar belonging to the Cholza clan.......<br /><br />The Cholzas have a legendary history from the dim past.<br />Manunidhi Cholzan, Sibi, and some others have a remote past.<br />During the third Sangam, we come across Karikalan,<br />NalangiLLi, NalangiLLi, an several others. Karikaalan's many<br />descendants started several royal dynasties in India and South<br />East Asia.<br />They were dormant for 600 years. We come across<br />KopperunchOlzan, and the father of Mangayarkkarasi wife of<br />NerumARa Pandyan, and a few others.<br /><br />The Cholzas were under the Pallavas. In the frequent wars<br />waged by the Pallavas and the Pandyas, the Cholzas took sides.<br />Then when both the overlords wore themselves out, the Cholzas<br />took over from the Pallavas. Then they overcame the Pandyas<br />and conquered a large territory. Thus the Imperial Cholzas came<br />into being. RajaRaja and Rajendra belong to this line.<br /><br />In 1216, Maravaraman Sundara Pandya I over-ran the<br />Chola Empire during the rule of Kuloththunga III. Soon after<br />the defeat, Kuloththunga died. His son RajaRaja III came to<br />the throne. But during the war, he was imprisoned by his own<br />feudatory, Kopperunjingga of Thirukkovaluur.<br />Due to the intervention of the Hoysala emperor of<br />Mysore, who happened to be RajaRaja's father-in-law,<br />MS Pandya gave back the Chola Mandala to RajaRaja III.<br />But something happened. So MS Pandya attacked again in<br />1246. Soon after that MSPandya died and two kings came<br />to power in quick succession. They were weak. The Hoysala<br />NaraSimha made use of this opportunity because by this time<br />he had become the father-in-law of Maravarman Sundara<br />Pandya II also. So he extended his territory from Mysore<br />right across Coimbatore, Dindigal, and Tiruchi where he built<br />a huge fortress at Samayapuram.<br />Thus he craeted a Hoysala wedge in Tamilnadu,<br />effectively separating the Cholzas in the north and the<br />Pandyas in the south.<br /><br />The last Chola emperor belonging to the Imperial Cholas<br />was Rajendra III. He came to the throne in 1256 A.D. He was<br />the son of RajaRaja III.<br /><br />He defeated MS Pandya II in a war. But the Hoysala<br />took the Pandiyan side this time, to prevent a revival of<br />Cholziyan Imperialism. But Jatavarman Sundara Pandya, the<br />greatest conqueror among the later Pandyas came to power<br />in 1251.<br /><br />He started on an expansionist policy and conquered Chera,<br />Chola,Ceylon and the Telugu Choda territories and also got rid<br />of the Hoysalas.<br /><br />But JS Pandya died in 1268 and was succeeded by<br />Maravarman Kulasekhara Pandya, the last of the Grand Pandyas.<br /><br />There was a last major war in which Rajendra III allied<br />himself with Hoysala Ramanatha, the son of Narasimha. But this<br />grand alliance was totally defeated by MKPandya.<br />This war took place in 1279.<br />And that is the last that we hear of Rajendra III and<br />the Cholas.<br />There is a group of people belonging to a particular<br />community. They claim to be the descendants of the Cholas.<br />Until about 40 years ago, one of the families belonging to<br />this community used to hold a symbolic coronation ceremony<br />in the Chidhambaram Temple just as their fore-runners did.<br /><br />The Kavirayar belongs to one of the kudis of this clan of<br />people. They call themselves 'Cholzagar' which is occassionally<br />used as a title.<br /><br />He had the help of a deity who used to do his bidding.<br />The deity carried a weapon called 'uLi' and used to ride a horse.<br />I am concealing his name. This is a different deity. Not the one<br />that you think.<br />There were also other deities whom he would invoke at times.<br />Also some spirits which would come to him when called.<br />Normally he would apply high quality perfumes. He is<br />seldom without them. But there were times when some bad odour<br />would be around when he is involved in doing some 'kalzichchal'<br />for somebody.<br />But when he passes into the Kavirayar personality, he does<br />not do all this type of work.<br />It was in 1984.<br />I was in a place called Kota Tinggi. The Kavirayar had come<br />to a place called Malacca on his own. He was staying at someone's<br />house. But his frequent pujais disturbed the household very much<br />and they sent him to Kota Tinggi. We made him stay in a room on<br />his own with its own bathroom. It was an old type of British Bungalow<br />quarters. Windows with slit-like shutters and huge doors.<br />After he came to Kota Tinggi, the time came for him to<br />renew his visa.<br />But to his horror, he could not find the passport and other<br />documents. He said that he had placed them in a brown paper<br />envelope and had kept in his 'trunkupetti'.<br />But it was not there.<br />He was very upset.<br />The next morning, he got up very early and took a bath.<br />Without combing his hair and wearing only a towel on his waist,<br />he smeared his arms and fore-head and his chest and belly<br />with kunkumam.<br />Then he jumped and said, "$%#@ *&$3 avanukkaachchu<br />enakkaachchu.....&%$# paaththuppuduvONdaa.....@##$%".<br />He liberally used foul words when he was not in the Kavirayar<br />personality.<br />Then he sat on a sofa in the hall and refused to talk anything<br />nor eat anything.<br />He was unusually silent.<br />Suddenly he jumped up.<br />There was a sound of commotion outside his room.<br />I saw something being dropped through the slit in the window<br />frame-work. Then there was a noise of somebody running away. And<br />there was the sound of hoofs. Horses hoofs.<br />There are no horses anywhere near Kota Tinggi.<br />The Kavirayar was jumping and ran towards the noise shouting,<br />"pidraa avaney..... pidraa...pirdraa....pidraa!"<br />We all rushed outside.<br />There was nothing there. Nobody.<br />No foot marks.<br />And no hoof-marks.<br />The Kavirayar ran back into the house.<br />He picked up the object that had dropped through the window.<br />It was a brown envelope.<br />Inside it, was the passport and all the documents.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />JayBee<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, nithya pillai<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hiiii.....<br />  anyone heard about reborn of ponniyin selvar with his<br />  identity sangu chakara regai.......<br />  do u belive in that??????<br />  nithi<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Get the freedom to save as many mails as you wish.
