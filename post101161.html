However, we are always given to<br />    understand that during the sangam era etc, society was more egalitarian. Why<br />    haven&#39;t we found any evidence for this in our texts?<br />   <br />    Cheers,<br />   <br />    Arun<br />   <br />   <br />    On 6/4/07, sridhar rathinam  wrote:<br />     <br />      Dear Arun<br />      looking at your querry in a different light...<br />      Science may have been a heriditary profession...vaithiyarin magan<br />      vaithiyan....kuyavanin magan kuyavan so the tricks of the trade might have<br />      been best kept family secrets<br />      regards<br />      Sri<br />     <br />      *Arun Krishnan * wrote:<br />     <br />      Hi VJ,<br />     <br />      Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts written in the<br />      southern part of India. My main query was to the utter lack of any<br />      scientific text in tamizh. Why? Again, if your contention is that it was the<br />      kings who decided, then sure, I can go with that...so Sanskrit was then<br />      language of science in India. Or was it? Does anyone know for certain? Just<br />      curious about it that&#39;s all...<br />     <br />      Also, sure the works from Sangams have been lost.. but I can&#39;t believe<br />      that of all the works that have come down to us, ONLY the scientific works<br />      have been lost in totality.. if there had been enough scientific treatises<br />      and volumes, we would have had some idea or inclination about it...<br />      somewhere, in some text..<br />     <br />     <br />      Cheers,<br />     <br />      Arun<br />     <br />      On 6/4/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br />       <br />        Hi,<br />       <br />        wisdom has been passed by word of mouth for C&#39;s even before writing<br />        systems evolved - the easiest way to remember these were through<br />        verses...the rhytymic chanting was a way to focus the mind and<br />        render them to memory..rendering findings in poems was the best way<br />        to capture it for posteriety. It wasnt akin to any da vinci code but<br />       <br />        just an easy way to codify it and commit to memory.<br />       <br />        please also bear in mind that tons of tamil literature is thought to<br />       <br />        have been lost .....wiki accounts...<br />       <br />        According to the Sangam legends first described in the Irayanaar<br />        Agapporul and a commentary to it by Nakkirar &#40;c. seventh/eighth<br />        century CE&#41;.[2] there were three Sangams spanning thousands of<br />        years. The first Sangam, whose seat was southern Madurai, later<br />        submerged into the sea, lasted a total of 4440 years and 4449 poets,<br />       <br />        which included some gods of the Hindu pantheon, took part in it. The<br />       <br />        second Sangam was convened in Kapatapuram, which finds mention in<br />        Valmiki Ramayana &#40;Kishkinda Kanda 42:13&#41;. This Sangam lasted for<br />        3700 years and had 3700 poets participating. This city also<br />        submerged in sea. The third Sangam is described as believed to be<br />        located in the current city of Madurai and lasted for 1850 years<br />        under 49 kings<br />       <br />        check out below links<br />       <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.histmedindia.org/surgery.htm">http://www.histmedindia.org/surgery.htm</a><!-- m --><br />       <br />        It is believed that Visapala, a woman related to Raja Chola,<br />        accompanied him into the battle field and lost a leg.

I would rather<br />       <br />          suggest<br />            that they have a logical basis behind it, not necessarily<br />          scientific.<br />           <br />            Perhaps I wasn&#39;t very clear in my original email. If you look at<br />       <br />          some of the<br />            great civilizations, you see existence of the scientific temper.<br />       <br />          The greeks,<br />            during the 6th -3rd century BC had great mathematicians and<br />          scientists,<br />            culminating possibly in Archimedes and Aristotle. We Indians had<br />       <br />          our own<br />            Susruta and Charaka and Aryabhatta and BHaskaracharya.

Or was the lingua franca<br />        of<br />          science<br />            in India, Sanskrit?

			<div class="content">dear arun<br /><br />What i meant was - just because you dont see it doesnt mean its not <br />there. Your initial posts sounded as though there was no scientific <br />know how for tamils - probably i could have got it wrong. After your <br />clarifications, your post is indeed food for thought and research -  <br />but I would like this forum to be a cross cultural one without any <br />caste/religious overbearings. However see from yours that the path <br />is different form mine and hence please excuse me from further <br />discussions on this post<br /><br />rgds<br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear VK,<br />  <br />  Am a little confused by this particular post of yours.

I<br />  point to a lack of texts in tamizh on<br />  the physical sciences. I am trying to figure out the reason for <br />this. The<br />  reason could be that since the Brahmins were<br />  jealous and zealous guardians of organized knowledge at that point <br />in time,<br />  they used Sanskrit for it. Or there could be<br />  other cultural reasons.<br />  <br />  You write,<br />  <br />  Selflessness comes after selfishness. self realisation and <br />godliness<br />  follow.

An examination of <br />the<br />        ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />        allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the <br />phallus<br />        &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated <br />into the<br />        Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical<br />        counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly<br />        therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman,<br />    white,<br />        yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as <br />vegatable<br />        poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the <br />Siddha<br />        tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the<br />        Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore,<br />    where<br />        the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />       <br />        The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the <br />sub-<br />        continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as<br />    ancient<br />        as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic<br />    study<br />        of nature and its elements and from what they were able to <br />grasp,<br />        they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is <br />now<br />    known<br />        as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles <br />of<br />        nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study <br />of the<br />        human system.<br />       <br />        The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for <br />knowledge for<br />        longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery<br />    over<br />        nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through <br />medicines.<br />    The<br />        people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves<br />    great<br />        yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine <br />propounded<br />    by<br />        them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This <br />system<br />        can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />       <br />        Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? <br />means<br />        perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to<br />    eight<br />        kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons <br />who<br />    had<br />        attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The <br />persons<br />    who<br />        had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as<br />    Siddhars.<br />        They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of <br />years<br />        ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for <br />truth,<br />        avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />       <br />        Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of<br />        medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />        Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm<br />        Literature which are believed to have been written thousands <br />of<br />        years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500<br />    works in<br />        Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life,<br />    nature<br />        of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory,<br />    space<br />        travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />       <br />        The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in <br />Mohenjo-<br />    daro<br />        Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of<br />        Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as <br />found a<br />        place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This <br />has<br />    been<br />        used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for <br />smallpox<br />    and<br />        other infectious diseases and also considered to possess <br />powers<br />    to<br />        ward off evil spirits.

			<div class="content">Dear Vijay,<br /><br />hmm am sorry you got the impression that I meant there was no scientific<br />knowhow for tamils.<br />Obviously with the scale of temples built and the large navies maintained,<br />there had to be<br />significant technological innovations. However, to reiterate, my query was<br />about the lack of<br />texts in "THAMIZH".<br /><br />Also, I don't see where in my posts I had raised an "caste/religious"<br />overbearings. One big<br />problem I have while discussing things with fellow tamilians is that any<br />reference to a caste, even in a<br />spirit of scientific enquiry suddenly makes everyone tiptoe around things. (<br />I grew up in the east of India<br />and my first exposure to casteism was when I came to TN .. incredible. The<br />first question I was asked ni<br />my new school was "which caste are you?").<br /><br />I consider myself to be a rationalist without caste or religious<br />underpinnings.. hence I can, will and do tend<br />to ask uncomfortable questions. If you refer to my speculation about the<br />possible answer to this<br />conundrum being that in the past Brahmins might have exclusively used<br />Sanskrit for all transfer<br />of knowledge, I am asking this in an entirely scientific manner... not to<br />malign Brahmins in any way.<br />(for the record, I am a Brahmin.. let's get it out there so people don't<br />start imputing motives to<br />every statement of mine).<br /><br />From: your postings, you seem to have significant knowledge about a range of<br />topics and hence it<br />would be a shame if you were to stop posting on this topic merely because I<br />raise uncomfortable questions <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/4/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear arun<br /> <br />  What i meant was - just because you dont see it doesnt mean its not<br />  there. Your initial posts sounded as though there was no scientific<br />  know how for tamils - probably i could have got it wrong. After your<br />  clarifications, your post is indeed food for thought and research -<br />  but I would like this forum to be a cross cultural one without any<br />  caste/religious overbearings.

How does<br />  the fact<br />    that we &#40;as in Indian science&#41;<br />    was more advanced than Europe have anything to do with my original<br />  query. I<br />    point to a lack of texts in tamizh on<br />    the physical sciences. I am trying to figure out the reason for<br />  this. The<br />    reason could be that since the Brahmins were<br />    jealous and zealous guardians of organized knowledge at that point<br />  in time,<br />    they used Sanskrit for it.

Lack of patronage for men of science unlike<br />        for the "pulavars"? Obviously, if it is not a paying job,<br />  people<br />      might not<br />        gravitate towards it.

An examination of<br />  the<br />          ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />          allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the<br />  phallus<br />          &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated<br />  into the<br />          Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical<br />          counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly<br />          therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman,<br />      white,<br />          yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as<br />  vegatable<br />          poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the<br />  Siddha<br />          tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the<br />          Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore,<br />      where<br />          the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />         <br />          The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the<br />  sub-<br />          continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as<br />      ancient<br />          as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic<br />      study<br />          of nature and its elements and from what they were able to<br />  grasp,<br />          they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is<br />  now<br />      known<br />          as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles<br />  of<br />          nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study<br />  of the<br />          human system.<br />         <br />          The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for<br />  knowledge for<br />          longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery<br />      over<br />          nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through<br />  medicines.<br />      The<br />          people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves<br />      great<br />          yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine<br />  propounded<br />      by<br />          them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This<br />  system<br />          can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />         <br />          Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit?<br />  means<br />          perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to<br />      eight<br />          kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons<br />  who<br />      had<br />          attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The<br />  persons<br />      who<br />          had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as<br />      Siddhars.<br />          They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of<br />  years<br />          ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for<br />  truth,<br />          avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />         <br />          Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of<br />          medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />          Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm<br />          Literature which are believed to have been written thousands<br />  of<br />          years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500<br />      works in<br />          Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life,<br />      nature<br />          of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory,<br />      space<br />          travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />         <br />          The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in<br />  Mohenjo-<br />      daro<br />          Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of<br />          Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as<br />  found a<br />          place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This<br />  has<br />      been<br />          used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for<br />  smallpox<br />      and<br />          other infectious diseases and also considered to possess<br />  powers<br />      to<br />          ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the<br />  germicidal<br />          action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa,<br />  Tirumular,<br />      the<br />          great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several<br />          thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss<br />      under a<br />          sacred pipal tree.<br />         <br />          vj<br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />   40yahoogroups.com      40yahoogroups.com ,<br />          "Arun Krishnan"<br />           wrote:<br />           <br />            Hi VJ,<br />           <br />            Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts<br />      written in<br />          the<br />            southern part of India.

			<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />I still feel tamils had an access to appropriate technologies suited <br />to that time for the bulk of the population. nothing flaboyant or <br />earth shattering.<br />there seems to have been no organised research and the conveyance of <br />information from one generation to another was severely disrupted in <br />early 14th century muslim invasion.<br />but the ability of tamils to pick up and assimilate any form of <br />science ( right upto software writing ) is well known<br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun <br />Krishnan"  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay,<br />  <br />  hmm am sorry you got the impression that I meant there was no <br />scientific<br />  knowhow for tamils.<br />  Obviously with the scale of temples built and the large navies <br />maintained,<br />  there had to be<br />  significant technological innovations. However, to reiterate, my <br />query was<br />  about the lack of<br />  texts in "THAMIZH".<br />  <br />  Also, I don&#39;t see where in my posts I had raised an "caste/<br />religious"<br />  overbearings. One big<br />  problem I have while discussing things with fellow tamilians is <br />that any<br />  reference to a caste, even in a<br />  spirit of scientific enquiry suddenly makes everyone tiptoe around <br />things. &#40;<br />  I grew up in the east of India<br />  and my first exposure to casteism was when I came to TN .. <br />incredible. The<br />  first question I was asked ni<br />  my new school was "which caste are you?"&#41;.<br />  <br />  I consider myself to be a rationalist without caste or religious<br />  underpinnings.. hence I can, will and do tend<br />  to ask uncomfortable questions. If you refer to my speculation <br />about the<br />  possible answer to this<br />  conundrum being that in the past Brahmins might have exclusively <br />used<br />  Sanskrit for all transfer<br />  of knowledge, I am asking this in an entirely scientific manner... <br />not to<br />  malign Brahmins in any way.<br />  &#40;for the record, I am a Brahmin.. let&#39;s get it out there so people <br />don&#39;t<br />  start imputing motives to<br />  every statement of mine&#41;.<br />  <br />  From: your postings, you seem to have significant knowledge about a <br />range of<br />  topics and hence it<br />  would be a shame if you were to stop posting on this topic merely <br />because I<br />  raise uncomfortable questions <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  <br />  Arun<br />  <br />  On 6/4/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br />   <br />    dear arun<br />   <br />    What i meant was - just because you dont see it doesnt mean its <br />not<br />    there.

An examination <br />of<br />    the<br />            ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />            allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the<br />    phallus<br />            &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated<br />    into the<br />            Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its <br />medical<br />            counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is <br />mainly<br />            therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, <br />bituman,<br />        white,<br />            yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as<br />    vegatable<br />            poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the<br />    Siddha<br />            tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in <br />the<br />            Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and <br />Singapore,<br />        where<br />            the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />           <br />            The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of <br />the<br />    sub-<br />            continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, <br />as<br />        ancient<br />            as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a <br />systematic<br />        study<br />            of nature and its elements and from what they were able to<br />    grasp,<br />            they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is<br />    now<br />        known<br />            as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic <br />principles<br />    of<br />            nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study<br />    of the<br />            human system.<br />           <br />            The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for<br />    knowledge for<br />            longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve <br />mastery<br />        over<br />            nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through<br />    medicines.<br />        The<br />            people who dedicated themselves to this task were <br />themselves<br />        great<br />            yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine<br />    propounded<br />        by<br />            them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This<br />    system<br />            can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />           <br />            Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit?<br />    means<br />            perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers <br />to<br />        eight<br />            kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The <br />persons<br />    who<br />        had<br />            attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The<br />    persons<br />        who<br />            had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as<br />        Siddhars.<br />            They are men born with great talents who lived thousands <br />of<br />    years<br />            ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for<br />    truth,<br />            avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />           <br />            Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the <br />use of<br />            medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular <br />Thirumantiram-<br />            Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of <br />Sangarm<br />            Literature which are believed to have been written <br />thousands<br />    of<br />            years before the Christian era. There are now more than <br />500<br />        works in<br />            Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of <br />life,<br />        nature<br />            of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic <br />theory,<br />        space<br />            travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />           <br />            The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in<br />    Mohenjo-<br />        daro<br />            Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System <br />of<br />            Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as<br />    found a<br />            place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. <br />This<br />    has<br />        been<br />            used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for<br />    smallpox<br />        and<br />            other infectious diseases and also considered to possess<br />    powers<br />        to<br />            ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the<br />    germicidal<br />            action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa,<br />    Tirumular,<br />        the<br />            great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for <br />several<br />            thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal <br />bliss<br />        under a<br />            sacred pipal tree.<br />           <br />            vj<br />           <br />            --- In <br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />       40yahoogroups.com        40yahoogroups.com ,<br />            "Arun Krishnan"<br />             wrote:<br />             <br />              Hi VJ,<br />             <br />              Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts<br />        written in<br />            the<br />              southern part of India.

			<div class="content">Arun<br /><br />Following are some of the things we know but never<br />thought of it from the POV of a scientific temper.<br />1. The environment that fostered a discussion on<br />things like the smell of the queens hair should be<br />tempered very much by the curiosity than the whims of<br />the kings. The way the question was tackled shows a<br />open challenge for anyone to solve, a peer review<br />process, dissension and agreement. I am not being<br />cheek-in-jowl here but the scientific enquiry of this<br />process is mind-boggling.<br />2. Maths. There were ancient tamil mathematical books<br />like Kanakkatikaram, Encuvati, Ponnilakkam and<br />Nellilakkam which are published by 'Ulaga tamilaraichi<br />niruvanam'. These are published from manuscripts as<br />much as 1000 years old.<br />3. There is enough scientific information in the<br />much-derided sangam literature, if only you care to<br />look at it. In fact, 'Kaniyan Poongundranar' is an<br />astronomer (may be an amateur) but the prefix Kaniyan<br />is the ancient tamil term for those who watch the sky<br />and do astronomical calculations. Thus there existed a<br />class of astronomers (we dont know what they found but<br />still it shows that the ancient Tamils were not as<br />averse to science as we think)<br />4. In fact, the most convincing of it is the<br />references of the astronomical events. The reference<br />to 'veLLi ezhundhu viyaazham uRangitru' in Thiruppavai<br />betrays the fact that Tamils know their astronomy<br />atleast 1200-1300 years back.<br />5. But why no big treatises or books? Not like Pliny<br />or Euclid but some manuscripts? If someone were to<br />walk into the 17th-18th century London and may be ask<br />for a copy of Newton's famous treatise in English, he<br />would've been laughing stock. Because Newton wrote his<br />'Principia Mathematica' in Latin and not in English.<br />Reason, Latin was considered the language of choice<br />for all scientific treatises. Whereas, Shakespeare and<br />John donne were writing verses describing nature in<br />English. 17th century England would've made you<br />believe that the English were purely nature loving<br />sentimental bogeys with no scientific temper. Same is<br />true in the first 500-600 years of Rome (replace<br />English with Latin and Latin with Greek). Greeks, of<br />course, had their literature as well as scientific<br />treatises in Greek since no 'superior' language was<br />available and most importantly, Greek is a classical<br />language which has written form from may be the 10th<br />century BC. My theory is the same thing happened in<br />the Tamil/Sanskrit relatioship as the scientific<br />language of choice being Sanskrit and Tamil was the<br />language for the bhakthi/nature (which seems to be<br />agonizing Arun somehow!). This may be the reason why<br />there is no big treatise available in Tamil. For that<br />matter, how much of scientific research is done in<br />Tamil now? English seems to be the language of choice<br />now. Thus may be 200 years down the line, another Arun<br />might pose a question on whether the Tamils in the<br />20th century has seen computers as there seems to be<br />no literature on computers but only agonizing poems on<br />lost loves.<br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />"'I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, Sir,' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself you see.'"<br />-Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div>

			<div class="content">dear arun<br /><br />it isnt a question of comfort for you n me, we are what we are and <br />carry it with pride... but i would rather continue the disc in <br />private with you as we might accidently hurt someone in the group.<br /><br />something to douse the heat n ...<br /><br />There is a saying in Sanskrit <br /><br />VISHNU ALANKARA PRIYA SHIVA ABHISHEKA PRIYA<br />SOORYO NAMASKARA PRIYA DEVI PRADISKNA PRIYA<br />BRAHMANO BHOJANA BHAJANA PRIYA<br /><br />The Devatha Vishnu needs to be richly decorated, while abhisheka is <br />very important to Lord Shiva. Numerous namaskaras are to be offered <br />to Soorya bhagawan, while Mahaa Devi has to be circambulated. The <br />Brahmins must......<br /><br />The first and foremost is the degree coffee - freshly ground coffee -<br />brewed in traditional brass decotion - filter. In davara tumbler - <br />mix with freshly milked full cream cows milk and atleast two spoons <br />of sugar - served piping hot... What a way to get up - reading the <br />headlines in the hindu paper and listening to MS suprabatham.<br /><br />Lets start with breakfast or should we call it brunch . Before <br />breakfast we need to clear the bowels- best way is to have a gulp of <br />inge sorasom - ginger ale - grate the ginger and boil in water till <br />all the essence is extracted. Let is coola <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> - add lemon juice and <br />jaggery or sugar. Gulp when still hot ( donÃ¢Â€Â™t sip) - it should scald <br />the throat as it goes down....<br /><br />My all time favorite would be pongal with either thakali gotsu or <br />thenga chutney ( white chutney). Pongal should be of the consistency <br />of glue - not too stiff, nor too watery. The rice should have lost <br />its individual shape, should be slightly sticky. Lots of molten ghee <br />on top and the garnishing should be the choiceist cashewnuts, black <br />pepper and curry leaves ( karu veppilai) - all crisply roasted in <br />ghee..a medu vadai ( yeah the one with the hole in the centre <br />resembling a doghnut) goes well with this combination. Pongal should <br />always be served on a banana leaf ( saves the trouble of having to <br />get the ghee of the plate while washing) eaten with the hand - The <br />test for a good pongal is that ghee and the aroma must linger even <br />after a through wash for atleast 2 hours. The thakali gotsu - the <br />tomatoes should have lost their individuality but the onions should <br />still retain theirs, the gravy should be hot and spicy ( lot of <br />green chillies) and the whole dish should be watery. The chutney <br />should be of watery consistency ( not getti chutney for pongal) with <br />lot of kadugu and karuveppilai ( thalichathu)<br /><br />The rest in that the order of merit are<br /><br />Poori keyangu - poori must be hot hot and puffy ( smoke comes out <br />when u break the puff) and the keyangu much have just potato, onions <br />( big) and green chilli with turmeric. Saravana bhavan seems to have <br />perfected this one. Min qty in multiples of 5.<br /><br />Idly with mulaga podi or murungakkai sambar. The podi must be coarse <br />and not finely ground. If mixed with a little paruppu podi and <br />molten ghee is heavenly. The mini idly in a bath of murungakkai <br />sambar with molten ghee topping ( again).....<br /><br /><br />Paper roast and getti chutney - the dosa has to be piping hot ( <br />thalaiya pathu kalla podanum - in my grand fathers words - see the <br />person and then heat the tava ). The thinner the dosa crispier the <br />crust, should not to be too crispy / brunt to break into pieces - <br />they have to be in the right consistency to allow you to manouver <br />the thumb, index and middle finger to break a piece of the dosa and <br />dip it into the chutney ( or pick up a whole chunk inside the dosa) <br />and dunk it into your mouth.<br /><br />Rava Dosai and kothamalli chutney - The rava dosai is slightly <br />different in consistency - since the rava need to gel - so itÃ¢Â€Â™s a <br />little more stickey, and is garnished with a few cashewnuts and ghee <br />roasted pepper. It goes well with kothamalli chutney.<br /><br />Mor Kali with elumichangai urgai - this is very simple dish - all u <br />need is rice flour and pulicha thai( sour curd). This with lemon <br />pickle is just divine.<br /><br />Arisi Upma with Vellam (Jaggery) - lot of kandal ( the slightly <br />burnt upma which sticks to the bottom of the vengala panai)<br /><br />Sevai ( elumichai evai and getti chutney)<br /><br />Rava Idly with thakali chutney<br /><br />Rava Kithcadi with kothamalli chutney<br /><br />Idiyappam and paya ( stew)<br /><br />After such a light breakfast, the best way to relax is on either a <br />kayatu kattil under the veppa maram or on the easy chair on the <br />mittam swaying to the gentle breeze.<br /><br />The main course - lunch......<br /><br />Carrot goss malli - must be juicy with lot of lime juice. Maanga <br />ingi / kuru milagu / magali <br />Dangar pachidi<br />Beans Paruppu usili - more beans less paruppu<br />Urulai roast- should not be oily but crispy fried<br />Vazaipoo vadai <br />Vazakkai podi mass - again with just a hint of lime<br />Thair pachidi - cocunut and a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of spice<br />Arisi Appalam ( for vatha kozambu), appalam, vadam, mor molagai, <br />kothavarangai, sundakkai.... Posanikkai/vendakkai/murugakkai vatha <br />kuzambu with karu vadam Vella Posanikkai/venkallai mor kuzambu <br />Thakali / vepambu/mulaga/pineapple rasam - let to soak in a <br />eyachombu Paruppu / milkmaid arisi /semiya payasam - just thick <br />enough to be able to swoosh of the leaf but watery enough to wade <br />into Maa vadu/lime pickle Neer moor ( nei urruki mor perukki) - sour <br />buttermilk, with a hint of lime, garnished with kothamalli and karu <br />veppilai<br /><br />eaten on a large thalai vazha elai - where you build partitions in <br />the mound of rice and swril the pazasam around till you can scoop it <br />up with a swift stroke of the hand and suuuurpppppp it down with an <br />audible suuuuuurpppp. chew on the drumstick till the pulp resembles <br />an idinja ambasador....<br /><br />And tiffin...<br /><br />Adai avial<br />- onion or murungali ( murunga leaf) adai - thick but crispy with <br />avial or jaggery. Is also good with lemon rasam...<br /><br />Thavala dosai / adai<br /><br />Onion/potato/capsicum bajji/ Masal vadai<br /><br />......am hungry all over</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Vijay and Arun,<br />Firstly, Nice to see people discussing about Science here. There are<br />two questions that have to be looked. <br />1. Was there any scientific analysis undertaken by Ancient Tamil people?<br />2. If so, have they been recorded in Tamil?<br />Arun's contention is why there are Scientific treatises in Sanskrit<br />and not in Tamil? <br />To answer this one has to go understand that the scientific<br />environment of our ancient people is not the same as what we are<br />seeing today. In other words, many of our beliefs are being considered<br />as superstitions now. Like for example, avoiding food while there is<br />an eclipse. etc etc. One also should understand that some of the<br />fundamental reasoning behind those practices were known to everyone at<br />that time and I truly believe that the reasoning has derailed on the<br />way, where the current people dont want to get confronted with<br />question of "Why?". It is my belief that every ritual and custom of<br />ours have a meaning and that too a scientific one. <br />Coming to the same example of Dharumi episode from Thiruvilayadal. If<br />the king had the same scientific reasoning what we see today, then he<br />would have done the following: <br />1. Take two new born girl children. Say A and B<br />2. for a certain period of time (again determining the exact period is<br />another experiment!!!) do the following. For A (she is the control)<br />dont apply any oil or perfumed stuff to her hair. For B, use all the<br />available oils and perfumed stuff.<br />3. After the period of time mentioned, remove the hair by shaving them<br />off and allow new hair to grow. <br />4. Check the results.<br />I know it may sound a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> funny, but one will never expect a king who<br />is supposed to protect his people will sacrifies two lives for the<br />sake of such an experiment. Moreover, the dharumi episode was not<br />about the question asked, but who answered it. In anycase, the reason<br />I told this modified example is to make a point that such kind of<br />reasoning is called scientific by us and only by us. This reasoning is<br />what we accept now. But it is an open secret (or fact?) that Indian<br />scientific approach and the european approach were altogether<br />different. When the victorian era britishers saw our practises they<br />deemed them as superstition, since their frequency of scientific<br />temper did not match with our ancient people's scientific temper. They<br />didnt find their kind of evidence to prove the same point. <br /><br />If you agree till here, then you would realize that language was never<br />a barrier to such activities. It is kind of trivial to ask if anything<br />was written down in Tamil. It would be nice to get hold of scientific<br />inscriptions in Tamil. But I dont see anything more than that. For<br />example one cannot prove if by having a scientific treatise in Tamil,<br />the ancient tamils were more scientic than their counterpart kingdoms.<br />Yes, it will surely prove the way they lived their lives. But that's<br />not the point. <br />The very fact that such practices are followed today, deemed as<br />superstition, had originated by our ancestors, is itself a proof that<br />they were scientific enough. In my opinion, writing down the proof was<br />not considered a great act by itself by the Ancient scientists,<br />stating the hypothesis and explaining it to people was, by itself a<br />great and efficient medium of message transmission. <br /><br />Maybe I am wrong, but to my brain, this is what I understand is the<br />reason. Also, Sanskrit is also one of our own languages. I equally<br />feel proud of all Indian languages. The question of Brahmins or any<br />other community taking a strong hold on languages is not a valid point<br />at all. Why do you have to think like that? If Brahmins or other<br />community were the only self made guardians of organized knowledge,<br />then we wouldn't be talking about how scientific our ancestors were.<br />Since, that would be the most protected entity and they would prevent<br />it from dispersing to others. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Ragothaman<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear arun<br />  <br />  What i meant was - just because you dont see it doesnt mean its not <br />  there.

An examination of <br />  the<br />          ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />          allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the <br />  phallus<br />          &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated <br />  into the<br />          Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical<br />          counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly<br />          therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman,<br />      white,<br />          yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as <br />  vegatable<br />          poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the <br />  Siddha<br />          tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the<br />          Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore,<br />      where<br />          the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />         <br />          The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the <br />  sub-<br />          continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as<br />      ancient<br />          as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic<br />      study<br />          of nature and its elements and from what they were able to <br />  grasp,<br />          they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is <br />  now<br />      known<br />          as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles <br />  of<br />          nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study <br />  of the<br />          human system.<br />         <br />          The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for <br />  knowledge for<br />          longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery<br />      over<br />          nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through <br />  medicines.<br />      The<br />          people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves<br />      great<br />          yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine <br />  propounded<br />      by<br />          them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This <br />  system<br />          can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />         <br />          Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? <br />  means<br />          perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to<br />      eight<br />          kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons <br />  who<br />      had<br />          attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The <br />  persons<br />      who<br />          had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as<br />      Siddhars.<br />          They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of <br />  years<br />          ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for <br />  truth,<br />          avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />         <br />          Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of<br />          medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />          Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm<br />          Literature which are believed to have been written thousands <br />  of<br />          years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500<br />      works in<br />          Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life,<br />      nature<br />          of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory,<br />      space<br />          travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />         <br />          The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in <br />  Mohenjo-<br />      daro<br />          Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of<br />          Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as <br />  found a<br />          place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This <br />  has<br />      been<br />          used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for <br />  smallpox<br />      and<br />          other infectious diseases and also considered to possess <br />  powers<br />      to<br />          ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the <br />  germicidal<br />          action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, <br />  Tirumular,<br />      the<br />          great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several<br />          thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss<br />      under a<br />          sacred pipal tree.<br />         <br />          vj<br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --> 40yahoogroups.com      40yahoogroups.com ,<br />          "Arun Krishnan"<br />           wrote:<br />           <br />            Hi VJ,<br />           <br />            Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts<br />      written in<br />          the<br />            southern part of India.

There <br />are<br />  two questions that have to be looked. <br />  1. Was there any scientific analysis undertaken by Ancient Tamil <br />people?<br />  2. If so, have they been recorded in Tamil?<br />  Arun&#39;s contention is why there are Scientific treatises in Sanskrit<br />  and not in Tamil? <br />  To answer this one has to go understand that the scientific<br />  environment of our ancient people is not the same as what we are<br />  seeing today. In other words, many of our beliefs are being <br />considered<br />  as superstitions now. Like for example, avoiding food while there <br />is<br />  an eclipse. etc etc. One also should understand that some of the<br />  fundamental reasoning behind those practices were known to <br />everyone at<br />  that time and I truly believe that the reasoning has derailed on <br />the<br />  way, where the current people dont want to get confronted with<br />  question of "Why?". It is my belief that every ritual and custom of<br />  ours have a meaning and that too a scientific one. <br />  Coming to the same example of Dharumi episode from Thiruvilayadal. <br />If<br />  the king had the same scientific reasoning what we see today, then <br />he<br />  would have done the following: <br />  1. Take two new born girl children. Say A and B<br />  2. for a certain period of time &#40;again determining the exact <br />period is<br />  another experiment!!!&#41; do the following. For A &#40;she is the control&#41;<br />  dont apply any oil or perfumed stuff to her hair. For B, use all <br />the<br />  available oils and perfumed stuff.<br />  3. After the period of time mentioned, remove the hair by shaving <br />them<br />  off and allow new hair to grow. <br />  4. Check the results.<br />  I know it may sound a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> funny, but one will never expect a king <br />who<br />  is supposed to protect his people will sacrifies two lives for the<br />  sake of such an experiment. Moreover, the dharumi episode was not<br />  about the question asked, but who answered it. In anycase, the <br />reason<br />  I told this modified example is to make a point that such kind of<br />  reasoning is called scientific by us and only by us. This <br />reasoning is<br />  what we accept now. But it is an open secret &#40;or fact?&#41; that Indian<br />  scientific approach and the european approach were altogether<br />  different. When the victorian era britishers saw our practises they<br />  deemed them as superstition, since their frequency of scientific<br />  temper did not match with our ancient people&#39;s scientific temper. <br />They<br />  didnt find their kind of evidence to prove the same point. <br />  <br />  If you agree till here, then you would realize that language was <br />never<br />  a barrier to such activities. It is kind of trivial to ask if <br />anything<br />  was written down in Tamil. It would be nice to get hold of <br />scientific<br />  inscriptions in Tamil. But I dont see anything more than that. For<br />  example one cannot prove if by having a scientific treatise in <br />Tamil,<br />  the ancient tamils were more scientic than their counterpart <br />kingdoms.<br />  Yes, it will surely prove the way they lived their lives. But <br />that&#39;s<br />  not the point. <br />  The very fact that such practices are followed today, deemed as<br />  superstition, had originated by our ancestors, is itself a proof <br />that<br />  they were scientific enough. In my opinion, writing down the proof <br />was<br />  not considered a great act by itself by the Ancient scientists,<br />  stating the hypothesis and explaining it to people was, by itself a<br />  great and efficient medium of message transmission. <br />  <br />  Maybe I am wrong, but to my brain, this is what I understand is the<br />  reason. Also, Sanskrit is also one of our own languages. I equally<br />  feel proud of all Indian languages. The question of Brahmins or any<br />  other community taking a strong hold on languages is not a valid <br />point<br />  at all. Why do you have to think like that? If Brahmins or other<br />  community were the only self made guardians of organized knowledge,<br />  then we wouldn&#39;t be talking about how scientific our ancestors <br />were.<br />  Since, that would be the most protected entity and they would <br />prevent<br />  it from dispersing to others. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Ragothaman<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    dear arun<br />    <br />    What i meant was - just because you dont see it doesnt mean its <br />not <br />    there.

The<br />      reason could be that since the Brahmins were<br />      jealous and zealous guardians of organized knowledge at that <br />point <br />    in time,<br />      they used Sanskrit for it.

An examination <br />of <br />    the<br />            ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans <br />owed<br />            allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the <br />    phallus<br />            &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated <br />    into the<br />            Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its <br />medical<br />            counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is <br />mainly<br />            therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, <br />bituman,<br />        white,<br />            yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as <br />    vegatable<br />            poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the <br />    Siddha<br />            tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in <br />the<br />            Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and <br />Singapore,<br />        where<br />            the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />           <br />            The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of <br />the <br />    sub-<br />            continent of India have an impressive and venerable <br />past, as<br />        ancient<br />            as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a <br />systematic<br />        study<br />            of nature and its elements and from what they were able <br />to <br />    grasp,<br />            they had developed a highly systematised medicine which <br />is <br />    now<br />        known<br />            as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic <br />principles <br />    of<br />            nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough <br />study <br />    of the<br />            human system.<br />           <br />            The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for <br />    knowledge for<br />            longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve <br />mastery<br />        over<br />            nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through <br />    medicines.<br />        The<br />            people who dedicated themselves to this task were <br />themselves<br />        great<br />            yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine <br />    propounded<br />        by<br />            them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. <br />This <br />    system<br />            can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />           <br />            Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?<br />chit? <br />    means<br />            perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally <br />refers to<br />        eight<br />            kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The <br />persons <br />    who<br />        had<br />            attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The <br />    persons<br />        who<br />            had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as<br />        Siddhars.<br />            They are men born with great talents who lived thousands <br />of <br />    years<br />            ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search <br />for <br />    truth,<br />            avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />           <br />            Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the <br />use of<br />            medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular <br />Thirumantiram-<br />            Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of <br />Sangarm<br />            Literature which are believed to have been written <br />thousands <br />    of<br />            years before the Christian era. There are now more than <br />500<br />        works in<br />            Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of <br />life,<br />        nature<br />            of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic <br />theory,<br />        space<br />            travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />           <br />            The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in <br />    Mohenjo-<br />        daro<br />            Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System <br />of<br />            Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as <br />    found a<br />            place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. <br />This <br />    has<br />        been<br />            used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for <br />    smallpox<br />        and<br />            other infectious diseases and also considered to possess <br />    powers<br />        to<br />            ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the <br />    germicidal<br />            action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, <br />    Tirumular,<br />        the<br />            great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for <br />several<br />            thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal <br />bliss<br />        under a<br />            sacred pipal tree.<br />           <br />            vj<br />           <br />            --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->   40yahoogroups.com        40yahoogroups.com ,<br />            "Arun Krishnan"<br />             wrote:<br />             <br />              Hi VJ,<br />             <br />              Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts<br />        written in<br />            the<br />              southern part of India.

			<div class="content">After reading this mail, I get reminded of an event a scientist was<br />recalling once in a conference in Delhi. When his group wanted to<br />publish their work in one of the high impact journals, the reviewers<br />told them to look up a paper published by a Japanese scholar. They did<br />look it up after a long search. There were two problems that they<br />faced now.<br />1. The paper was published in a Japanese journal entirely in Japanese.<br />2. The Japanese scholar had done the same work few years back.<br />Although Japanese are very proud of their language, which they should<br />be. But, one can see the difficulty the work was getting transmitted.  <br />Regards,<br />Ragothaman<br /> <br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Muthu Prakash Ravindran<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Arun<br />  <br />  Following are some of the things we know but never<br />  thought of it from the POV of a scientific temper.<br />  1. The environment that fostered a discussion on<br />  things like the smell of the queens hair should be<br />  tempered very much by the curiosity than the whims of<br />  the kings. The way the question was tackled shows a<br />  open challenge for anyone to solve, a peer review<br />  process, dissension and agreement. I am not being<br />  cheek-in-jowl here but the scientific enquiry of this<br />  process is mind-boggling.<br />  2. Maths. There were ancient tamil mathematical books<br />  like Kanakkatikaram, Encuvati, Ponnilakkam and<br />  Nellilakkam which are published by &#39;Ulaga tamilaraichi<br />  niruvanam&#39;. These are published from manuscripts as<br />  much as 1000 years old.<br />  3. There is enough scientific information in the<br />  much-derided sangam literature, if only you care to<br />  look at it. In fact, &#39;Kaniyan Poongundranar&#39; is an<br />  astronomer &#40;may be an amateur&#41; but the prefix Kaniyan<br />  is the ancient tamil term for those who watch the sky<br />  and do astronomical calculations. Thus there existed a<br />  class of astronomers &#40;we dont know what they found but<br />  still it shows that the ancient Tamils were not as<br />  averse to science as we think&#41;<br />  4. In fact, the most convincing of it is the<br />  references of the astronomical events. The reference<br />  to &#39;veLLi ezhundhu viyaazham uRangitru&#39; in Thiruppavai<br />  betrays the fact that Tamils know their astronomy<br />  atleast 1200-1300 years back.<br />  5. But why no big treatises or books? Not like Pliny<br />  or Euclid but some manuscripts? If someone were to<br />  walk into the 17th-18th century London and may be ask<br />  for a copy of Newton&#39;s famous treatise in English, he<br />  would&#39;ve been laughing stock. Because Newton wrote his<br />  &#39;Principia Mathematica&#39; in Latin and not in English.<br />  Reason, Latin was considered the language of choice<br />  for all scientific treatises. Whereas, Shakespeare and<br />  John donne were writing verses describing nature in<br />  English. 17th century England would&#39;ve made you<br />  believe that the English were purely nature loving<br />  sentimental bogeys with no scientific temper. Same is<br />  true in the first 500-600 years of Rome &#40;replace<br />  English with Latin and Latin with Greek&#41;. Greeks, of<br />  course, had their literature as well as scientific<br />  treatises in Greek since no &#39;superior&#39; language was<br />  available and most importantly, Greek is a classical<br />  language which has written form from may be the 10th<br />  century BC. My theory is the same thing happened in<br />  the Tamil/Sanskrit relatioship as the scientific<br />  language of choice being Sanskrit and Tamil was the<br />  language for the bhakthi/nature &#40;which seems to be<br />  agonizing Arun somehow!&#41;. This may be the reason why<br />  there is no big treatise available in Tamil. For that<br />  matter, how much of scientific research is done in<br />  Tamil now? English seems to be the language of choice<br />  now. Thus may be 200 years down the line, another Arun<br />  might pose a question on whether the Tamils in the<br />  20th century has seen computers as there seems to be<br />  no literature on computers but only agonizing poems on<br />  lost loves.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said Alice, &#39;because I&#39;m<br />not myself you see.&#39;" <br />  -Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">What a discussion? Didnt check the mail for few days and my god, <br />what a flood of mails.<br /><br />Aruns basic question is, why dont we have scientific treaties in <br />tamil and only in Sanskrit.<br /><br />Mr.Ramachandran, epigraphist from State Archeological survey, when <br />we met during a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> meeting, put forth a point, which I feel is very <br />logical. As we have English as the official langugae today, Sanskrit <br />was the official language in olden days. It was not the language of <br />only the affluent or rather the brahmins, but it was the court <br />language of the kings.<br /><br />Thats why we find most of the pallava kalvettu's in Sanskrit, almost <br />all the other kalvettus atleast start with a sanskrit phrase. <br /><br />So logically, this answers the question why there is no scientific <br />treaties or books available in Tamil.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>
