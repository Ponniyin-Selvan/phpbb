			<div class="content">British did India no favor by building rails or bridges, they did it for their own cause for the 'long haul', unfortunately they bumped into some road blocks in name of genuine freedom fighters such as Gandhi , Patel , Bharathi and Bose etc. Our politicians are following the footsteps of brits so they are no good. North south divide - hindu muslim rift - language barriers etc was all done by brits. They did that over a period of 100 years, they never fixed anything, they ignited a time bomb that will put them totally in control at any point of our life. They were interested in archeology not to build indian history but to track and posses the wealth we had.<br /><br />They stole our money, our morals, our values and everything we had, they left us in such a dire state that we landed up with politicians who work exactly like the british.<br />The crown was nothing short of a petty criminal.<br /><br />Today, they repent, who says nations do not have consequence. No kingdom can rule for a long period, every single atom that is born has an expiry date and the brits are feeling for their misdeeds while slaving poor countries.<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Vijay Veerasamy <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Friday, November 23, 2007 12:11:53 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] British India vs Post Independence India<br /><br />I think our history systematically ignored in north<br />after independence.<br /><br />As far as I know British are good for uniting/building<br />India.<br /><br />Politicians are rubbish systematically killed good<br />governance left by British.<br /><br />I remember one bridge collapsed during 1997-1999 near<br />Chennai on east coast road constructed at that time.<br />The comedy was authorities tried to demolish(by<br />blasting) old bridge built by British didn't collpase<br />but due to impact on the new bridge completely fallen.<br /><br />The whole day I was unable to control my laugh reading<br />this funny!<br /><br />So post independence Indian politics/governance infact<br />worsened itself made British better like the above<br />incident.<br /><br />There were 180 ponds/lakes until 1947 in Chennai<br />effectively helping water supply/drainage.

			<div class="content">The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />today, when compared with contemporary nations: <br /><br />1) The Sati system<br />2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />3) Untouchability & bad treatment of lower caste.<br />4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />5) Fate of widows<br />6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) & the<br />devadasi system<br />7) Slavery<br />8) Marriage at childhood<br />9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br /><br />But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />main crux to be focussed.<br /><br />The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!<br /><br />--- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br /> <br />  what did the british break up?<br />  what except a geographic cohesion link us even<br />  today.<br />  if you feel our terrorism and day to day problems<br />  are due to the<br />  british you are mistaken.<br />  we are just making him a bogey man for everything.<br /> <br />  i am not ridiculing our freedom fighters. but how<br />  many of them if<br />  alive today will like the state of affairs in the<br />  country.<br />  do you think they would be happy.<br />  when the british left there were 500 states. &#40; if<br />  they had not come<br />  at all there would have ben a 1500&#41;states the<br />  average size of nepal<br />  and some like hyderabad bigger than many european<br />  states. they had a<br />  great chance of surviving today.<br />  the smaller ones would have been gobbled up by the<br />  bigger ones but we<br />  would definitely not have had one entity caled<br />  india.<br />  there would have been a perpetual blood bath in this<br />  part of the<br />  world. we would have become like central africa.<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Nawabs stood no chance in changing India to<br />  persia.

			<div class="content">-Hi<br /><br />I would like to point out some actions taken by the british <br />government and people against some of their officials who were said <br />to have looted india.<br /><br />robert Clive had to defend his actions against his numerous and <br />vocal critics in Britain. Cross-examined by a Parliament suspicious <br />of his vast wealth, he claimed to have taken relatively limited <br />advantage of the opportunities presented to him: "By God...I stand <br />astonished at my own moderation".<br />Despite his vindication, on 22 November 1774 he committed suicide at <br />his Berkeley Square home in London by stabbing himself with a pen-<br />knife.<br /><br />warren hastings was impeached ( though later acquitted)<br />dyer- the butcher of jalinwala bagh was put up before a commmision<br /><br />even jackson durai is reported to have been suspended for <br />antagonising kattabomman.<br /><br />it is so heart warming when we see black and white pictures of gandhi <br />being welcomed by the comon man in uk during the round table <br />conference. <br />inspite of all the politics indians share a rare warmth with the <br />british and the commonwealth because our founding fathers realised <br />another colonial ruler would have been worser.<br /><br /><br />it is not a question of english or indians.people all over the world <br />get mesmerised by power.<br /><br />right now we have extra judicial killings in kashmir and the north <br />east. human rights violations in nandigram. <br />though some of these can be justly compared to the british actions, <br />they may be worse as these are by a democratically elected government <br />against the people who have to be protected by them. <br />after all the british had conquered a territory and it was in their <br />interests to hold on to it, just as it is our aim to get it released.<br /><br />I wish people would read kalki's article praising the british for <br />their bravery during the nazi bombing. how he could segregate issues <br />was fantastic.<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Venkateswaran K <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />  about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />  really spread to India through the Britishers.

The children<br />  should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />  illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage.

			<div class="content">Dear Venkateswaran,<br /><br />I would definitely be against all your points. What you described, may<br />have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />characteristics of india.<br /><br />I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing our<br />territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill of<br />ourself.<br /><br />Ok. let me counter your points.<br /><br />1) The Sati system<br />The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the women.<br />Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain areas of<br />North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request you to read a<br />first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to a women<br />committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br /><br />I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards this<br />started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We should<br />also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the dress style is<br />entirely different..<br /><br />3. Untouchability: <br /><br />This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower caste. <br />Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the SC castes<br />do not drink water in other SC caste's family.<br /><br />Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in india,<br />the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the semitic<br />concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br /><br />The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br /><br />4. Education & Employment: <br /><br />Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your ignorance. As<br />per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools in Bengal province. <br />Almost all villages had schools, and most of today's BC/MBC & some SC<br />castes received education.<br />The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in all<br />over madras presidency.<br /><br />You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.<br /><br /><br /><br />5) Fate of widows<br />You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But they<br />had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the western<br />nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th century, we had<br />adequate representation & protection of women .<br /><br />6. Devadasi: <br /><br />Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system were<br />meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the devadaasis<br />enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadasi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadasi</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the highly<br />narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as sin. (whereas<br />in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and devadasis, while<br />enjoying high status, also had the privilege of choosing her partner. <br />Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. the concept of brahmacharya<br />and celebacy came only after buddhism effect.)<br /><br />See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the bharatanatyam, were<br />pioneered by devadaasis,.. Many of the popular artists, like lata<br />mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as prostitutes..<br />Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam cannot originate from a<br />prostitutes.. The devadasis are degraded to prostitution, because of<br />loss of their patronage, during British rule, as they took over all<br />sources of wealth.<br /><br /><br />7. Slavery: <br />Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of time..<br />probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br /><br />8. Child Marriage: <br /><br />Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close relatives<br />till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the girl child<br />should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The girl child grows<br />as part of her husband's family, right from her childhood and get<br />adapted to it.<br /><br />Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those days.<br /><br />"When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in the west<br />even today, child marriage is far far better"<br /><br />If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why it is<br />considered as evil.<br /><br />9. Priestly Class<br /><br />Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, and<br />spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested with<br />brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />vellalars.<br /><br />also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of untouchability,<br />gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br /><br />So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few castes<br />are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed priestly<br />hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br /><br />10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br /><br />This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our mother<br />tongues..<br /><br />11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br /><br />Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its sacrificed in<br />temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br /><br />Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated slaughtering<br />house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own community<br />(not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, and killing<br />thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br /><br />Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br /><br />Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like that, let's<br />stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br /><br /><br />we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br /><br />I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who committed<br />numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa Inquisition is one<br />of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, committed by the europeans. <br />Refer the below links.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br />Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one is<br />barbaric.<br /><br />No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really a<br />continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of our<br />culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going to<br />achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a paradise in<br />the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, still india is our<br />only land for us)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Venkateswaran K <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />  about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />  really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />  those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />  society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />  today, when compared with contemporary nations: <br /> <br />  1&#41; The Sati system<br />  2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />  garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />  3&#41; Untouchability & bad treatment of lower caste.<br />  4&#41; Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />  5&#41; Fate of widows<br />  6&#41; Marriage of girls to gods &#40; pottu kattutal &#41; & the<br />  devadasi system<br />  7&#41; Slavery<br />  8&#41; Marriage at childhood<br />  9&#41; Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />  10&#41; Suppression of mother tongues.<br />  11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br /> <br />  But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />  main crux to be focussed.<br /> <br />  The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />  children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />  pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />  truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />  enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />  should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />  illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />  they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">-Hi<br />everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting <br />personal or emotional about it.<br /><br />that was a long reply and befor vk replies i'll just like to add <br />santayana's statement on history<br /><br />'those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"<br /><br />just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a <br />confident indian.<br />its just hogwash.<br />the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a <br />problem.<br /><br />we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi <br />system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them or <br />placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.<br /><br />in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic excesses <br />in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called <br />patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in his <br />society and points out to them bravely.<br /><br />its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point out.<br /><br /><br />venketesh</div>
