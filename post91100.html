It describes the events in the Indian independence movement <br />in 1947-48, beginning with the appointment of Lord Mountbatten as <br />the last viceroy of British India, and ending with the death and <br />funeral of Mahatma Gandhi. this book contains a lot of bare ( gory) <br />facts - and makes you look at a lot of our father figures in new <br />light ( incl the mahatma, nehru, patel). there are also interesting <br />accounts of Jinnah...incidentally this book is banned in pakisthan...<br /><br />The authors having interviewed many of those who were there, <br />including Lord Mountbatten, the book gives a detailed account of the <br />last year of British India, the princely states' reactions to <br />independence, the partition of India and Pakistan, and the bloodshed <br />that followed. It also covers the events leading to the <br />assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The book is a result of deeply <br />scanned and researched events which often are left out by the <br />historians. The maps of India and Pakistan were drawn on religious <br />grounds by a man named Cyril Radcliffe who had never visited India <br />in his life. The book also explains the fury of both Hindus and <br />Muslims, misled by their communal leaders, during the partition and <br />the biggest mass slaughter in the history of India - more people <br />lost their lives in this painful year than the two world wars put <br />together...<br /><br /><br />why i quote this book is that,the letter of assession and the <br />situation leading to raja Hari singh signing it are clearly outlined <br />in the book...<br /><br />The Raja did not want to accede either to india or to pakisthan but <br />wanted to remain independant. Pakisthan wanted to get kashmir by <br />force - but couldnt afford an outright war - hence they covertly <br />armed afridis ( mujahideen??)from the north west frontier province <br />and let them a free hand to ran sack kashmir and thereby intimidate <br />the king to accede to pakisthan....they were successful and the band <br />of gun men were just a few miles from the only servicable airport in <br />srinagar ......<br /><br />Lord mountbatten refused to send troops into kashmir till the king <br />signed the assession - Mr. menon meets with the king takes the <br />signed copy an flies back to delhi late evening( no night flights <br />those days)...the raja goes to sleep telling his aide not to wake <br />him up if indian army doesnt arrive by day break and instead shoot <br />him in his sleep.....<br /><br />the gunmen are hours away from securing the airport when they come <br />across a christian mission with 13 foreign nuns and spend the night <br />committing .......and fail to reach the airport...<br /><br />indian <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>force plane lands in srinagar at 4.45 am and are <br />successfull in beating back the gunmen.....thus kashmir came to <br />india. go back and read the letter from Raja Hari singh now<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf">http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf</a><!-- m --><br /><br />this happened on 26th Oct 1947.

It describes the events in the Indian independence <br />movement <br />  in 1947-48, beginning with the appointment of Lord Mountbatten as <br />  the last viceroy of British India, and ending with the death and <br />  funeral of Mahatma Gandhi. this book contains a lot of bare &#40; <br />gory&#41; <br />  facts - and makes you look at a lot of our father figures in new <br />  light &#40; incl the mahatma, nehru, patel&#41;. there are also <br />interesting <br />  accounts of Jinnah...incidentally this book is banned in <br />pakisthan...<br />  <br />  The authors having interviewed many of those who were there, <br />  including Lord Mountbatten, the book gives a detailed account of <br />the <br />  last year of British India, the princely states&#39; reactions to <br />  independence, the partition of India and Pakistan, and the <br />bloodshed <br />  that followed. It also covers the events leading to the <br />  assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The book is a result of deeply <br />  scanned and researched events which often are left out by the <br />  historians. The maps of India and Pakistan were drawn on religious <br />  grounds by a man named Cyril Radcliffe who had never visited India <br />  in his life. The book also explains the fury of both Hindus and <br />  Muslims, misled by their communal leaders, during the partition <br />and <br />  the biggest mass slaughter in the history of India - more people <br />  lost their lives in this painful year than the two world wars put <br />  together...<br />  <br />  <br />  why i quote this book is that,the letter of assession and the <br />  situation leading to raja Hari singh signing it are clearly <br />outlined <br />  in the book...<br />  <br />  The Raja did not want to accede either to india or to pakisthan <br />but <br />  wanted to remain independant. Pakisthan wanted to get kashmir by <br />  force - but couldnt afford an outright war - hence they covertly <br />  armed afridis &#40; mujahideen??&#41;from the north west frontier province <br />  and let them a free hand to ran sack kashmir and thereby <br />intimidate <br />  the king to accede to pakisthan....they were successful and the <br />band <br />  of gun men were just a few miles from the only servicable airport <br />in <br />  srinagar ......<br />  <br />  Lord mountbatten refused to send troops into kashmir till the king <br />  signed the assession - Mr. menon meets with the king takes the <br />  signed copy an flies back to delhi late evening&#40; no night flights <br />  those days&#41;...the raja goes to sleep telling his aide not to wake <br />  him up if indian army doesnt arrive by day break and instead shoot <br />  him in his sleep.....<br />  <br />  the gunmen are hours away from securing the airport when they come <br />  across a christian mission with 13 foreign nuns and spend the <br />night <br />  committing .......and fail to reach the airport...<br />  <br />  indian <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>force plane lands in srinagar at 4.45 am and are <br />  successfull in beating back the gunmen.....thus kashmir came to <br />  india. go back and read the letter from Raja Hari singh now<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf">http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  this happened on 26th Oct 1947.

			<div class="content">Do you know why we got freedom at midnight? 15th August alright, but why did<br />it have to be the stroke of midnight? It never stuck me as odd - but after<br />all, Pakistan got its freedom during daylight! why should our independence<br />be gotten at midnight?<br /><br />I didnt realize the difference until I got a gleaning from today's 'The<br />Hindu'<br /><br />Interesting <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of new taken from today's hindu (<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories/2007081551020400.htm">http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories ... 020400.htm</a><!-- m -->) for your<br />reading:<br /><br />The British Government had decided that the transfer of power to India, as<br />represented by the Constituent Assembly should take place on the 15th of<br />August. The British do not consult astrologers when they take political<br />decisions, but there were quite a few eminent personages in Delhi who<br />believed (many of them still do) in the effect of stellar combinations on<br />human affairs and some of them began consulting astrologers as to whether<br />the 15th was an auspicious day for the occasion. The advice was that it was<br />not; a far more auspicious day was the 14th. But this was the day fixed for<br />the renunciation of British authority over Pakistan and in fact, Lord<br />Mountbatten, the Viceroy, was in Karachi that morning formally to announce<br />the transfer of power to that country and he flew back to Delhi the same<br />afternoon. A solution for the problem was discovered, to the best of my<br />recollection, by the agile brain of Sardar K. M. Panikkar, a brilliant<br />writer of history in the English language, a scholar in Malayalam, also a<br />deep student of the more recondite features of Hindu religion, and withal a<br />great wit. He said he had discovered a formula which would appease the stars<br />as well as make it unnecessary for the British government to change the date<br />which had been announced in Parliament. The members of the Constituent<br />Assembly would meet on the 14th, about half-an-hour or so before midnight;<br />this would propitiate the stars. They would, however, take the oath of<br />allegiance to Free India after the stroke of midnight which, according to<br />British recognition, would be the 15th. Everybody seemed satisfied and<br />arrangements were made accordingly.<br /><br />On 8/14/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hi sir,<br /> <br />  the linkto the audio file:<br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.harappa.com/sounds/nehru.html">http://www.harappa.com/sounds/nehru.html</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  text of the speech<br /> <br />  Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes<br />  when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but<br />  very substantially.

We end today a period of ill fortune and India<br />  discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is but a<br />  step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and<br />  achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to<br />  grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?<br /> <br />  Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests<br />  upon this Assembly, a sovereign body representing the sovereign<br />  people of India. Before the birth of freedom we have endured all the<br />  pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of the<br />  sorrow. Some of those pains continue even now. Nevertheless, the<br />  past is over and it is the future that beckons to us now.<br /> <br />  That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving<br />  so that we might fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and the<br />  one we shall take today. The service of India means the service of<br />  the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and<br />  ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of<br />  the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from<br />  every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and<br />  suffering, so long our work will not be over.<br /> <br />  And so we have to labour and to work, and work hard to give reality<br />  to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also for the<br />  world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together<br />  today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. Peace<br />  has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is prosperity<br />  now, and so also a disaster in this One World that can no longer be<br />  split into isolated fragments.<br /> <br />  To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an<br />  appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure.<br />  This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for ill<br />  will or blaming others.

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />This is true - this is also the reason why Pakistan got theirs on <br />14th - a day ahead of us.  <br /><br />You can read more on these and why the exact date was picked by <br />Mountbatten in the book Freedom at midnight - when the viceroy took <br />charge with a specific agenda by the crown to go ahead with the <br />release of india, he got questioned on when he would handover <br />charge ...and he gave the first date that came to his mind - the day <br />where he scored his major success against the invading japanese <br />forces - during his tenure as the commander of the british forces in <br />the far east - which he thought was his favorite month/day. <br /><br />There is speculation to this day as to if the viceroy did this is <br />haste - the famous Mountbatten Plan was drafted and the actual <br />division between the two new dominions was taken on 3rd June.The <br />border between India and Pakistan was determined by Sir Cyril <br />Radcliffe, who had very little time to survey the actual land border <br />to assess the physical boundries - dykes, lakes and canals etc. He <br />had to depend on outdated land records and instead of the clinical <br />strike of a surgeons scalpel - he used a butchers strike to cut <br />through...<br /><br />But more startling facts are revealed in the book, that Md Jinnah <br />was ailing from acute TB ( having very little time left to live) and <br />this information was kept secret even from the british secret <br />service...Mountbatten himself stated later that had he known of <br />this,he might have delayed the partition and ......<br /><br /><br />More startling facts the assassination of mahatma and how the <br />investigations preceeding the actual shooting and the laxity of the <br />government/police machinery and dealt with in graphical detail in <br />this book - a must read. not for the faint hearted.<br /><br /><br />rgds<br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Madan U Sreenivasan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Do you know why we got freedom at midnight? 15th August alright, <br />but why did<br />  it have to be the stroke of midnight?

The British do not consult astrologers when they take <br />political<br />  decisions, but there were quite a few eminent personages in Delhi <br />who<br />  believed &#40;many of them still do&#41; in the effect of stellar <br />combinations on<br />  human affairs and some of them began consulting astrologers as to <br />whether<br />  the 15th was an auspicious day for the occasion. The advice was <br />that it was<br />  not; a far more auspicious day was the 14th. But this was the day <br />fixed for<br />  the renunciation of British authority over Pakistan and in fact, <br />Lord<br />  Mountbatten, the Viceroy, was in Karachi that morning formally to <br />announce<br />  the transfer of power to that country and he flew back to Delhi <br />the same<br />  afternoon. A solution for the problem was discovered, to the best <br />of my<br />  recollection, by the agile brain of Sardar K. M.
