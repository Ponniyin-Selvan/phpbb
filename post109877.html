			<div class="content">Hi Malathi,<br />I am from coimbatore.I disagree on this part of your mail-girls of coimbatore see movies, shop for saree , eat out and are thoroughly spoilt.please do come and see them now.There are women like Rajshree Pathy,Mrs.Nandhini Rangasamy,Dr.Asha Rao,Mrs .Rajini krishnamoorthy to name a few who are heading bussiness and educational institutions.Some youngsters in their late twenties are also managing schools very well.My friend whose family is one of the top ten families in coimbatore is in charge of a multi specality hospital and she runs it so well.<br />Even here in coimbatore you can see young girls zooming in their two wheelers late in the night.<br />with regards,<br />shanthi<br /><br /><br />Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani). Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlike stress ridden Chennai <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else.<br /><br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never ever seen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what do we do, same ultimately.<br /><br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more. I beleive Shoba also said she is from there.<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Anandhi Subramanian  wrote: <br /><br />From: Anandhi Subramanian <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 12:35 PM<br /><br />Malathi,<br /><br />You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.<br /><br />I did my Masters from ADU, coimbatore. Unforgettable years in my life.<br /><br />Anandhi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Malathi Mahadevan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 5:21 AM<br /><br />Arun, Coimbatore.. oh wow..I could write volumes..I grew up there...if you want to combine all the 'graamiya' movies made it would not take a candle to the conservativsm in Coimbatore as far as women go. When I went to school there - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich people and very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was also a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if you want to<br />relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br /><br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br /><br />More later,<br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Arun Krishnan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Arun Krishnan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 3:45 AM<br /><br />Hi Madan,<br /><br />Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan <br /><br />Hi Arun,<br /><br />I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment to his daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.<br /><br />So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br />2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <br /><br />Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spite of all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that here in Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy.<br /><br />Just my tuppence worth.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan <br /><br /><br />Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, we have a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And have you noticed there wasn&#39;t much response to this subject....? !</div></blockquote>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart from Malathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small subgroup this forum is to larger one that is the society.<br /><br />The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br />2008/9/4 Priya <br /><br /><br />Thanks Malathi and Shri for your comments.<br /><br />Malathi, What you told about women's mindset about women's self<br />respect is greatly true.

			<div class="content">Hi Malathi,<br />I am from coimbatore.I disagree on this part of your mail-girls of coimbatore see movies, shop for saree , eat out and are thoroughly spoilt.please do come and see them now.There are women like Rajshree Pathy,Mrs.Nandhini Rangasamy,Dr.Asha Rao,Mrs .Rajini krishnamoorthy to name a few who are heading bussiness and educational institutions.Some youngsters in their late twenties are also managing schools very well.My friend whose family is one of the top ten families in coimbatore is in charge of a multi specality hospital and she runs it so well.<br />Even here in coimbatore you can see young girls zooming in their two wheelers late in the night.<br />with regards,<br />shanthi<br /><br /><br />Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani). Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlike stress ridden Chennai <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else.<br /><br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never ever seen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what do we do, same ultimately.<br /><br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more. I beleive Shoba also said she is from there.<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Anandhi Subramanian  wrote: <br /><br />From: Anandhi Subramanian <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 12:35 PM<br /><br />Malathi,<br /><br />You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.<br /><br />I did my Masters from ADU, coimbatore.

When I went to school there - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich people and very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was also a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if you want to<br />relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br /><br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br /><br />More later,<br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Arun Krishnan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Arun Krishnan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 3:45 AM<br /><br />Hi Madan,<br /><br />Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan <br /><br />Hi Arun,<br /><br />I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment to his daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.<br /><br />So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br />2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <br /><br />Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spite of all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that here in Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy.<br /><br />Just my tuppence worth.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan <br /><br /><br />Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, we have a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And have you noticed there wasn&#39;t much response to this subject....? !</div></blockquote>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart from Malathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small subgroup this forum is to larger one that is the society.<br /><br />The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br />2008/9/4 Priya <br /><br /><br />Thanks Malathi and Shri for your comments.<br /><br />Malathi, What you told about women's mindset about women's self<br />respect is greatly true. I too accept it. And have you noticed there<br />wasn't much response to this subject....? !<br /><br />regards<br />Priya<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Shriram Rajaram <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi priya,<br /> <br />  i usually dont like to read big emails in english!! but this one is<br />tamizh doesnt make me lazy to read the entire thing!<br /> <br />  P.S: this is the same in French to me....i love to read any big emails<br /> <br />  Shri<br /> <br /><br />  --- El miÃƒÂ©, 3/9/08, Priya Balachandran <br />escribiÃƒÂ³: <br />  De: Priya Balachandran <br /><br />  Asunto: [ponniyinselvan] Men&#39;s mind set about women&#39;s self-respect<br />  Para: ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />  Fecha: miÃƒÂ©rcoles, 3 septiembre, 2008 4:01<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¿ Ã Â®Â…Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â³Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯ÂŠÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â©Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¯Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â¯Â†Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â©Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯Â</div></blockquote>Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯Â†Ã Â®Â£Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â³Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â®Â®Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â© Ã Â®Â‡Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â®Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â…Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤ Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â´Ã Â®Â²Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â‡Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â•<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â±Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â.<br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â² Ã Â®Â‡Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â™Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â³Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â…Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â°Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯Â†Ã Â®Â£Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â³Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¯Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¯Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂˆÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¯Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â®Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂŠÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â±Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â±Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯Â.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Ã Â®Â‡Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â±Ã Â¯ÂˆÃ Â®Â¯ Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â´Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â™Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â³Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â…Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â</div></blockquote>Ã Â®ÂŽÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â¿ Ã Â®Â‰Ã Â®Â³Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â³Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â?

			<div class="content">Dear Shanthi, I was talking of the Kovai of my days(70s and 80s). Very gladto hear of the progress. It would be pertinent though to look at some statistics also - I have been to different parts of TN - Tiruchy, Madurai, Kovai,Â  for example. Comparatively speaking Kovai lifestyle was much more laid back and more prosperous, definitely.<br />Â <br />In my class of 54 girls only 3 of us did post graduation. Out of that one stayed back in Kovai, one went to Delhi and I came to US. It was completely unthinkable among the rest to go out of Kovai. Even when I visited some beloved friends they areÂ  astonished 'enna panareenga anga' .Also was pertinent that in those days atleast there were no bookshops or libraries in Kovai - other than those selling textbooks and tea stalls with tamil magazines. I was among the minority who used to go to railway station Higginbothams for buying books or frequent old newspaper shops to grab discarded copies. It is a true fact.<br />Â <br />If things have improved am truly happy since it was the land I grew up in,<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Tue, 9/9/08, shanthi palaninathan  wrote: <br /><br />From: shanthi palaninathan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Tuesday, September 9, 2008, 6:02 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Malathi,<br />I am from coimbatore.I disagree on this part of your mail-girls of coimbatore seeÂ  movies, shop for saree , eat out and are thoroughly spoilt.please do come and see them now.There are women like Rajshree Pathy,Mrs.Nandhini Rangasamy,Dr. Asha Rao,Mrs .Rajini krishnamoorthy to name a few who are heading bussiness and educational institutions. Some youngsters in their late twenties are also managing schools very well.My friend whoseÂ  family is one of the top ten families in coimbatore is in charge of a multi specality hospital and she runs it so well.<br />Even here in coimbatore you can see young girls zooming in their two wheelers late in the night.<br />with regards,<br />shanthi<br /><br /><br />Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani) . Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) <br />Â <br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlikestress ridden Chennai <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else. <br />Â <br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never everseen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what doÂ we do, same ultimately.<br />Â <br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more.

When I went to schoolthere - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich peopleand very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was alsoÂ a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if<br />you want to relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br />Â <br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br />Â <br />More later,<br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Arun Krishnan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Arun Krishnan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 3:45 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Madan,<br /><br />Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Arun,<br /><br />Â Â  I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.<br /><br />Â Â  So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. <br /><br />Just my tuppence worth.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And have you noticed there wasn&#39;t much response to this subject....? !</div></blockquote>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.<br /><br />The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br /><br />2008/9/4 Priya <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks Malathi and Shri for your comments. <br /><br />Malathi, What you told about women's mindset about women's self<br />respect is greatly true. I too accept it.

			<div class="content">Udanx, SPS sir has already gave you an explanation which made my job easier. I think you didn't get my point. In my last mail itself I told that 'there are some women and men who have succeeded by themselves (at least as far as we know that they are not dependent on anyone) like Mother Teresa and Abdul kalam'.<br /><br />And also I told earlier that both men and women are dependent in one way or other in a society.<br /><br />when you say that somebody influence your carreer's success, it doesn't strictly mean that they have to help you in your carreer. They should cooperate with you in such a way that you have enough time to concentrate in your carrer. Even the wives or husbands who donot know anything about your job could contribute to your success by looking after all the responsibilties at home, including your responsibilities. That may or may not come to light even in case of great successful person.<br /><br />you have told that 'behind every bright man's failure in life / business there is definetly a woman's hand'!. So you yourself accept a woman has influence in man's failure. This implies that a woman has influence in man's life and so also in success. That of course applies for a woman. I just go by your words only.<br /><br />Its my humble opinion that, nobody is trying to prove you wrong, we are just exchanging our views. Ofcourse opinion differs, that does mean somebody's wrong and somebody's right. Have no hard feelings, and be cool.<br /><br />thanks and regards,<br />Priya<br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Udanx <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Tuesday, September 9, 2008 4:07:48 AM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br /><br /><br />SPS,<br /><br />Let your wife take a bow from me. I salute that lady who had been a visionary about real estates. But again the sample size is small from your end as well. Both the parties can keep on quoting examples which will keep this thread active for sometime. But I trust thats not the motive of this thread.<br /><br />In one of my earlier mails in this thread I have accepted that given the freedom and suport women can shine in their fields and I quoted the case of ICICI Bank. I will go even a step ahead, with the support and freeodm woman out class / out smart men. But it is mandatory for ALL SUCESSFUL woman that she gets freedom and support.<br /><br />Where as MOST OF THE SUCESSFUL MEN didnt need support from woman. This is my observation about the society. If I am proved wrong I am ready to eat my words. After all this group is for learning new things / sharing ideas and knowledge.<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />Thats the end of my mail for woman folks<br /><br /><br />Guys,<br /><br />It may be noted that behind every bright man's failure in life / business there is definetly a woman's hand!<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />PS: I am that my inbox will be bombarded with feminist in our group for the previous line. Lunch @ Andra Mess and Curd rice in action ... Kanna Kattudhu ... So thought of writing a mail which will keep me awake for some time now! Velila Ore Mazha What to do?<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Atpu, very well said <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br />Â <br />Men and women being equal does not mean they are 'same' there are basic differences which will never be the same - the average man is usually strongerthan a woman, a woman can have children and has certain natural nurturing tendencies, women think from the 'heart' as someone said and men from the 'head'. These differences are exactly why there are differences in treatmentas you point out - it is courtesy to open doors, carry bags and such things to a woman, and if you see carefully usually many men *like* a woman to ask them for help with heavy luggage, let them drive the car, and so on. It has nothing to do with being liberal it is just simple good natured acts ofcourtesy to one another with gentle awareness of how we are different. <br />Â <br />Female strength is moral courage not physical. It is conceptually not understood at all unfortunately in many parts of our country despite having so much of historical and religious background emphasizing it.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Tue, 9/9/08, atpu555  wrote: <br /><br />From: atpu555 <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Tuesday, September 9, 2008, 4:03 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear all,<br /><br />To share my thoughts, if I may..<br /><br />Behind every successful person, there will be several people who would <br />have played important parts.

			<div class="content">Priya,<br /><br />Success in career and success in personal life are two different things.<br />Career wise there are lot of sucessful men / women, whose personal life is<br />pathetic. So suscess in one field (Career) doesnt need sacrifice by the<br />partner in the other (Personal).<br /><br />But if you want to strike a balance of good career and good personal life<br />then the sacrifice of the partner comes in picture. I am talking about<br />sucess in career alone. Now tell me what are we talking / discussing about.<br />Are we in the same page? If YES Then we will discuss.<br /><br />~ Udanx<br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>
