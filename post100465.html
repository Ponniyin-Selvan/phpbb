			<div class="content">Dear Venkatesh and Satish,<br /><br />Thanks for your mails. We requested to notify our mistakes in the <br />past. You did it. This helps us to correct ourselves.<br /><br />Dear VK and Shankaran,<br /><br />That is the right attitude towards finding truth. Keep it up.<br /><br />Dear All,<br /><br />Since, there were some discussions and finger pointing based on an <br />article published in our varlaaru.com, we feel it is our <br />responsibility to explain. So, I take this opportunity to clarify <br />certain things happening for past 1 year on behalf of varalaaru team.<br /><br />1. Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos<br /><br />When we made trip to thanjavur and pazhaiyaarai last year by this <br />time, some of us accepted that the person in thanjavur painting was <br />Rajaraja and the person in panchavan madhevi pallippadai was <br />Rajendra based on the location and 'who else it could be' basis. But <br />for some of us, it was not convincing proof. So, i just wanted to <br />let them understand what all they have to accept if they start <br />accepting without considering other negative evidences. So, I posted <br />a picture of Buddha statue with chakra mark in it. As Rajaraja also <br />had sangu chakra rekhai in his palms according to Thiruvalangadu <br />copper plates, i told it has to be considered as Rajaraja. People <br />started disproving the statement and gave valid points why it cannot <br />be Rajaraja. I was happy and hoped that people would apply the same <br />rules for the issues raised during the trip too. So, I ended the <br />drama with explanation of my actual intention.<br /><br />Swetha oru dheerkka dharisi. Her words<br /><br />"Kamal, neenga Japan ponalum intha pavam ungalai uruthu vanthu <br />oottum!"<br /><br />has become true now. I have changed the description of the pictures. <br />So, new members won't get misguided.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />2. Rajaraja and Karuvoor thevar painting<br /><br />It was told that the young man and old man in thanjavur painting <br />were Rajaraja and his spiritual guru Karuvoor thevar. But from <br />inscriptions of Rajarajeswaram, we knew that Rajaraja's guru <br />was 'Eesana siva pandithar' and not Karuvoor thevar. Karuvoor thevar <br />was not mentioned in any of Rajaraja period inscriptions. It clearly <br />proves that there was no relationship between Rajaraja and <br />Karuvooraar even if a person by name Karuvoor thevar lived during <br />that period. Thiruvisaippaa was quoted for proof. When i went <br />through that, i misunderstood Thirubhuvanam with Thiru poovanam. <br />When Venkatesh notified that, I couldn't reply immediately as i <br />became busy at work and some personal commitments. After that, new <br />threads were started and i forgot to reply to that. Anyway, I accept <br />that it was my mistake.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />3. Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu.<br /><br />Satish wrote this in his reply to Venkateswaran Kasirajan last week. <br />At first, SPS introduced Dr.Kudavoil Balu to varalaaru.com team <br />during mid 2004. Then, varalaaru team met Dr.Balu during December <br />2004 and early January 2005 while bringing special issue for <br />Rajarajeswaram. In all these three meetings, Dr.Balu mentioned that <br />Periya koyil was built based on Magudagamam concept. We requested <br />him to show the book. At that time, he said it is in Sanskrit. As of <br />now, in tamilnadu, only his guru Dr.Nagasamy can read and understand <br />that and even he himself cannot read it. When we met Dr.Kalaikkovan <br />on 26th January in Trichy as part of our 5 days mega trip, we asked <br />if he knows anything about Magudagamam. He said he also heard it <br />from Dr.Balu only during Big temple Kudamuzhukku around 10 years <br />ago. At that time itself he asked but couldn't see the book till <br />date. Whenever we discussed with Dr.Kalaikkovan about magudagamam <br />concept, he never told that it doesn't exist. He always told that he <br />hasn't seen it yet. Satish joined us in one or two trips during the <br />thiruvalanjuzhi research. At that time, we are not sure if <br />Dr.Kalaikkovan told satish like this. Satish only knows. In his <br />article also, he didn't mention that it does not exist. He just <br />wanted to see it.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />4. Varalaaru article claims that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s life was very well documented<br /><br />Venkatesh raised this point in his reply to Satish's mail and he <br />tried to disprove saying "then why are we groping in the dark about <br />most of the details of his life and death?". I don't think anywhere <br />in the article it is mentioned that all the events in his life were <br />very well documented. It says only his significant achievements were <br />documented. Though unusually Rajaraja documented extensively, we <br />cannot expect him to mention when did he catch cold, how many times <br />he sneezed and all. I request to read the articles properly before <br />making such sweeping statements.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />5. Who else it could be? Rajaraja and Rajasimma<br /><br />In his second mail to VK, Satish quoted that when Dr.Kalaikkovan <br />said that the statue of a king in Dharmaraja radham is Rajasimma <br />on 'who else it could be' basis, we accepted. In the same way, when <br />he said that painting in periya koyil is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> on the same basis, we <br />didn't accept. With this, he came to a conclusion that <br />Dr.Kalaikkovan accepts assumptions indirectly.<br /><br />Dear Satish,<br /><br />Do you really think both 'Who else it could be' are same? I am not <br />sure if you have read the book 'Adhyandha kaamam' completely. <br />Otherwise, you wouldn't have raised this point. I give the summary <br />of points considered before concluding it is Rajasimma. If you are <br />not convinced still, it is my inability to explain as I don't have <br />the book with me right now and please go through the book.<br /><br />Labeled Royal Portraits are usually met with only on prominent parts <br />of the temple such as the walls or the niches. You may refer to <br />Mahavaraaha temple at Mamallapuram and several other temples in the <br />cholamandalam (Thiruvaavaduthurai, Thiruvisaloor, Konerirajapuram, <br />etc). Dr. Kudavoil Balu himself has mentioned a few such labeled <br />portraits carved on the walls of the temple towers at Chidambaram in <br />his book entitled 'Goburakkalai marabu'.<br /><br />Though labeled portrait sculptures are detected so far in the greeva <br />naasikaas or koodu in the kapodha, male figures worshipping linga <br />are depicted in many temples. Thiruvalanjuzhi is a good example <br />where one can identify many such figures. Don't you think that one <br />should take much care before identifying a figure as a particular <br />royal person? Is this not his duty to provide enough evidences to <br />substantiate such identity before it is questioned?<br /><br />In the case of adhyandha kaamam, the creator of the temple was <br />identified after a thorough analysis of its architecture, iconology <br />and epigraphic records. This and the titles (Srimega, Sri Trilokya <br />vardhana and Vidhi) engraved on the niche where the sculpture is <br />placed, helped to confirm the portrait figure as Rajasimma.<br /><br />Ram is translating the chapter 'Nizhalum Nijamum' from the <br />book 'Adhyandha kaamam' as Dr. Michael Lockwood asked for the <br />English version. We will send it soon.<br /><br />Now, let us see the case of rajarajeswaram. In the saanthaaram <br />paintings, two persons are said to be Rajaraja.<br /><br />a. Person worshipping Nataraja<br /><br />Appearance of the person worshipping Nataraja has no dissimilarities <br />with Cheraman peruman naayanar portrayed in Sundarar panel. Cheraman <br />peruman was also a king. We cannot say only Rajaraja worshipped <br />Nataraja. So, it can be any king. All we can say is one king is <br />portrayed. That's all. 'Who else it could be' argument is <br />inappropriate here. We know for sure that two persons in other side <br />panel is Sundarar and Cheraman because we know the theme behind it <br />and other pieces of paintings in that panel are also supporting <br />this. This worshipping panel may also have some theme behind it. <br />Unless a complete study like 'Adhyandha kaamam' is carried out, we <br />cannot say who is who. Not only panel, which has that person, entire <br />panel in the wall has to be studied properly without any <br />preconceived notion. Even when the well known sundarar panel was <br />studied by Dr.Kalaikkovan, we encountered lot of stunning details. <br />They are going to be published in his book 'Vaanan vandhu vazhi <br />thandhu' shortly.<br /><br />b. Young man and old man<br /><br />The two persons are said to be Rajaraja and his guru karuvoor <br />thevar. Already it is proved that there is no relationship between <br />these two. The attire and hairstyle doesn't match with a king. <br />Moreover, Dr.Kudavoil Balu proved that they are 'Sanakaadhi <br />munivargal'. I am not sure if he has written any article on this. <br />But when varalaaru team met him in thanjavur for second or third <br />time, he explained how he concluded that they are sanakaadhi <br />munivargal. All his points were very much valid and acceptable. You <br />can ask him when you meet next time.<br /><br />So, from this, we can conclude that both cannot be said to be <br />Rajaraja and both 'who else it could be' are not same.<br /><br />Here, i would like to have a disclaimer. We are in the beginning <br />stage of learning historical research methodologies and subject. Our <br />explanation capabilities are limited. So, please do not go by our <br />statements which are not complete or quoted in different scenario. <br />When you encounter such things, please look at the source or ask for <br />more explanation. Because, already such confusion occurred in the <br />past regarding podhikai. In Pullamangai and Thiruvalanjuzhi, we had <br />less time and had lot of things to see other than podhikai. So, I <br />couldn't explain well. In that case, consulting the articles of <br />Kattadakkalai series would be helpful. Hope you understand my point.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />6. School of thought and ego clash<br /><br />Venkatesh used to mention about "School of thought" in couple of his <br />mails in the sense we are adherents of Dr.Kalaikkovan's school of <br />thought. So, we hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu during his talk in tanjore. <br />I really don't understand where the scope for school of thought is <br />in the current scenario.<br /><br />Dear Venkatesh,<br /><br />Which one do you mean by 'School of thought' here? If you <br />say 'Rajaraja was ego-centric person. So, he might have projected <br />him somewhere in his masterpiece temple', that is school of thought. <br />If you say 'Tholkappiyam has words like 'enmanaar pulavar'. So it <br />may belong to 7th century AD', that is school of thought. If you <br />say 'Thirukkural uses some of Jainism concepts. So, thiruvalluvar <br />may be a Jain', that is school of thought. But how can Magudagamam <br />and pon vimaanam concept be considered as School of thought when we <br />have evidences to disprove the role of Magudagamam in big temple?<br /><br />And you said 'at last the clash of the egos has come to the <br />forefront'. It is not so. As i stated in the point 3, this issue was <br />brought out around 10 years before when the reference of magudagamam <br />was first quoted in Big temple Kumbabishekam malar. Many scholars <br />witnessed this. What do you mean by 'behind the scene and proxy <br />squabbling'? What is the necessity for us to hide and fight? Didn't <br />we ask these questions directly to Dr.Kudavoil Balu? If our <br />questions were answered already, why are we asking again and again? <br />Moreover, none of our questions are unanswerable during our times or <br />as difficult as finding Tutankhamen tomb.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />7. Varalaaru team hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu<br /><br />Dear Venkatesh,<br /><br />In the same mail, you said 'so many times we have all discussed how <br />Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled'. I frankly say that till this point <br />of time, we really don't understand how did we hassle him. You told <br />many times that we hassled him. But never told how. Even when Ram <br />asked you directly in the beach meeting, it was not responded <br />properly and topic got diverted. You said 'not only me. All of us <br />felt like that'. When I checked with some of the members, they said <br />they didn't think that Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled. I already <br />explained in the earlier messages. I am repeating here. Till this <br />date, varalaaru team is in good relationship with Dr.Kudavoil Balu. <br />We met couple of times even after our tanjore trip. If we are not <br />respecting him, why should we bring special issue on him? Why should <br />he allow us to publish his articles in guest section? Why should we <br />meet him again when we went to thanjavur? And I used to hear offline <br />comments like whatever Dr. Kudavoil Balu says, varalaaru team <br />doesn't accept. It is not true. When he says anything with proper <br />supportive evidences, we always accepted them. Best example is the <br />Sanakaadhi munivargal in the painting. If we oppose him blindly, why <br />should we accept this?<br /><br />Satish may know that we ask many questions before accepting any info <br />told by even Dr.Kalaikkovan. How can cross verification be <br />considered as hassling? Dr.Balu is a well experienced scholar in the <br />field of epigraphy. His hard work cannot be discarded by anyone. <br />Already we asked him these questions we have asked here. He would <br />have faced lot of such questions from scholars like Subbarayalu as <br />well as beginners like us. He knows how to handle it. In spite of <br />all these, if you still want to believe that he was hassled, well, <br />go ahead. We don't have any objections.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />team<br /><br />I think this is the most important thing to be clarified. Because, <br />we are directly blamed here. Couldn't believe when we read the <br />following lines from SPS's mail. Immediately thought of asking 'You <br />too SB sir?'.<br /><br />"Last year by this time we visited Thanjai ... we were thrilled to <br />go... after returning as Vencat rightly observed of various schools <br />of thoughts surfaced in open, some new members could not understand <br />the intricacies ... there was some discomfort."<br /><br />Also, it was painful to hear from a PSVP member who is in close <br />friends circle that 'because of Ram's questions only, members lost <br />interest in proceeding further and not co-operating to materialize <br />anything from PSVP'.<br /><br />Another statement from a member who didn't participate in the trip. <br />We don't know whether to laugh or worry. 'That was ponniyin selvan <br />tour. Varalaaru team unnecessarily involved history and spoiled the <br />mood of the trip'. If so, why was Dr. Kudavoil Balu invited? Did he <br />explain how did kalki write <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>?<br /><br />I am asking the following questions to all PSVP members.<br /><br />Dear all PSVP members,<br /><br />For the sake of argument, let us assume that we had hassled Dr. <br />Kudavoil Balu. But, because of that, <br /><br />Why should PSVP members get demoralised? Do you expect us not to ask <br />any questions? Where is the research without asking questions? Can <br />any student learn the subject properly without asking questions? If <br />SPS hadn't asked me and Lavanya the question 'Is Ravidasan real or <br />fictitious?' on 28th Jan 2003, what would we be doing now? Do you <br />think whatever scholars say have to be accepted without cross <br />verifying? Does cross verification mean insulting or questioning the <br />credibility of the scholar? Then what is the need of question time <br />in the conferences after presentation of each paper? Didn't <br />varalaaru team face such difference of opinions surfacing in open? <br />Wasn't the article presented by me and Pavithra in the Tamilnadu <br />history congress conference torn into pieces by scholars? Weren't <br />their questions answered patiently by us? Did we get demotivated <br />because of that? Didn't we co-operate to bring out varalaaru.com <br />after that? Do you think 2 years journey of varalaaru.com was a cake <br />walk? Did we bring out 400 articles just like that without any <br />struggle? How can things like big temple be achieved if just one <br />incident demotivates you all?<br /><br />Since couple of our discussions with Dr.Kudavoil Balu were visible <br />to some members, above conclusion was reached. What would have <br />happened if our meetings with Dr.Rajavelu, Iravadham Mahadevan, <br />Michael Lockwood, and Dr.K.Rajan etc were seen? We would not be <br />surprised even by the comment like 'because of varalaaru team only, <br />flow of mails is less in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group'. Though we couldn't control, me <br />and Ram refrained ourselves from asking any question to <br />Mr.S.Ramachandran in T.Nagar meeting regarding his speech about <br />letters in the inscriptions. Otherwise, it would have been possible <br />to hear comment like 'because of me and Ram only, not many members <br />enrolled for inscriptions reading course'.<br /><br />This is also one of the reasons why we don't inform the group about <br />our trips. Many members expressed their interest to participate in <br />our trips and asked to inform in advance. We also thought of doing <br />so. But after seeing these things, we changed our mind to avoid such <br />unnecessary comments. Apologies to those who were interested.<br /><br />Varalaaru team always wanted to help PSVP in all possible ways. It <br />is your responsibility or interest to ask what you need from us or <br />what do you want us to do. If you really feel that we are thorn in <br />the flesh, it is not so difficult to sideline or avoid 5 of us and <br />make things happen and continue the great work.<br /><br />Hope you all understand what I tried to say. Though some names are <br />mentioned explicitly, no personal offense is meant.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Kamal,<br /><br />Quite a long mail. Took a long time for me to read. All your points <br />are very much valid. I am bound to reply, because my name was openly <br />quoted many a times.<br /><br />First things first, I am a very poor reader, second, I have a very <br />poor retention power. So even if I had read the books you quoted, i <br />dont realize the points. Third, I am not a great scholor in any <br />subject and I dont have even the basic knowledge to question on many <br />of the points you raise. I am just like any other common man, who <br />has a passion for history but not as high as yours. YOu people are <br />becoming experts and proven writers, but I am not. So many of my <br />words would have been on the cream and not in depth.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venkatesh and Satish,<br />  <br />  1. Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos</div></blockquote>Sorry to say, this was a real mockery which took everyone aback. <br />Your intentions might be good, but the way it was presented was not <br />good. Lets admit that.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>*****************************************<br />  <br />  3. Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu.</div></blockquote>Any common man like me will decipher this only as I quoted. On the <br />surface, it looks like saying it doesnt exisit. As I said, I am not <br />a scholar to understand such nuances of the article and its my <br />mistake. Apologies.<br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>5. Who else it could be? Rajaraja and Rajasimma</div></blockquote>Again the above point holds good. For a common man like me same <br />logic holds good. Probably, if just a gist about the difference was <br />given to me or anyone like me, even an one liner, as you <br />said, 'Adyantha kamam deals with this', it would have made a <br />difference, rather than brushing aside the topic with a giggle.<br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>*****************************************<br />  <br />  6. School of thought and ego clash<br />  7. Varalaaru team hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu</div></blockquote>I dont even remember what Venkatesh claims or swetha says, or for <br />that matter I even dont know what was said on that day, one thing is <br />fresh in my memory even now. Do you remember my question to you all, <br />I mean ALL, on the very first day of the first trip I came with you? <br />It was 29 January, Sunday, evening, in the van, after a days trip <br />with Dr.Kudavoil - I was new to this arena and was just observing <br />what Dr.KB told and what you people questioned. THough much of that <br />didnt enter my blockhead, I asked you people, 'why do you laugh for <br />everything Dr.Balu says?'. Its the first impression everyone gets. <br />Only after a couple of visits with you and getting to know each one <br />personally, I could digest that point. <br /><br />I am extremely sorry for bringing this up, but since I am quoted, I <br />am bound to respond. I was thinking that its only me who took it in <br />that sense, but later came to know that(after nearly 10 months) <br />everyone feels the same. Thats the first impression every one gets. <br />If I am pointed one time, it can be others mistake,if I am pointed <br />more than once, its my mistake.<br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />  team</div></blockquote>Same as above. First impression is the best impression, it could be <br />wrong, but still you are making an impression, my friend. That makes <br />all the difference.<br /><br />Kamal, Ram, Lavanya, Gokul and Krupa,<br /><br />I think I am one of the very few fortunate (I think I can count the <br />numbers) people who know all five of you personally and I take the <br />pride of knowing you all. I share a very special friendship with you <br />all. Request you to contribute more and keep up the spirit of this <br />group alive for the coming years. One thing, this mail is good to <br />have put out everything openly. I always feel its better to pour <br />out rather than taking things personally to heart. <br /><br />What the scholars say are above the heads of the common people like <br />me. Thats one of the main reason history is not appreciated by many. <br />You being in the younger age group can bridge this gap and make <br />things simple and interesting to all. As I commented for this months <br />varallaru.com, two years you have come a long way, get into the next <br />orbit and try to make things simpler and intersting to all. <br /><br />As Venkatesh pointed, if anything more, lets take in the personal <br />mail chain.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by shan karan  using id shan_karan2000</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Friends,<br /><br />First of all Congrrats Varalaaru team.<br /><br />An article in last issue reached many and its bought up many valuable discussions here, so our varalaaru .com is a gr8 sucess, keep up the good work.<br /><br />Venkatesh/Satish<br /><br />Its as simple as , our varalaaru team having Dr.Kalikovan as their master, nothing wrong it, thier views with Dr.Kudavayil diff many times , we have seen. Its all based thier approach towards history.Let me put it like this Dr.Kudavayil balu has a style of taking history to common man, so his style and his finding may differ from others, thats dosen't mean that any of us under grading him.<br /><br />Kamal<br /><br />Really its a big mail.anyhow my name is also mentioned in ur mail , i feel i have to explain my views in that :<br /><br />Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos<br /><br />Pls take it lightly a sort of fun, in the middle of hard subject.We every one knows that<br /><br />2. Rajaraja and Karuvoor thevar painting<br /><br />As i have told earlier Karuvoor thevar is not a single person, may be that even been a title given as like Viyasar, but sure <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> 's guru is not Karuvoor thevar, Guru is "Eesana siva pandithar" .<br /><br />3.Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu<br /><br />Dr.Kalaikovan in his article saying that he wants a read that magudaagamam, and now we r in the process of finding that book, sure we can come back with better result in coming days. Let us wait for sometime in this pls, really its a good input and we can have some interesting inputs.<br /><br />4. Varalaaru article claims that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s life was very well documented<br /><br />Yes <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> achivements well documented, accept still there are so many questions left, let us take it like this " May be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> is keen on documenting his achivements and not his personal life" may be thats y we have left out with questions like " what he did in between 969 to 985 , and how and where he died and all.<br /><br />But Kamal you could have posted this better way - sorry kamal<br /><br />a. Person worshipping Nataraja<br /><br />Its a long pending question, even i too remember i have asked the same to Dr.Kalaikovan in Rajarajeswaram and his reply" could be" even Gokul perosnally accepted that it should be only <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>, the point we need to take up here is , that painting are fresco, and panel need to be completed in set few hrs. We can think like this " as a great person <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> buliding that temple , we can feel that it should be only <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>"<br /><br />But friends we have no evidence, we can feel and belive that all.<br /><br />8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru<br />team<br /><br />NO , i am not accepting that, PSVP is the second line team of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group , which is require lot of support and inputs for First line Varalaaru team.<br /><br />Let the questions come, by that way only we can understand the history, views may diff, discussion will go , i feel thats all require, we all r matured persons, been together on subject interest, we need questions , may be the questions from few like me on basic things , but our first line team responded postively , and the qestions from them giving us new lights, so let us welcome and PSVP NEVER GOT DEMOTIVATED and its welcomes the questions and open discussion as a subject matter.<br /><br />Regards<br />Shankaran<br /><br />"S.Kamalakkannan"  wrote:<br />Dear Venkatesh and Satish,<br /><br />Thanks for your mails. We requested to notify our mistakes in the<br />past. You did it. This helps us to correct ourselves.<br /><br />Dear VK and Shankaran,<br /><br />That is the right attitude towards finding truth. Keep it up.<br /><br />Dear All,<br /><br />Since, there were some discussions and finger pointing based on an<br />article published in our varlaaru.com, we feel it is our<br />responsibility to explain. So, I take this opportunity to clarify<br />certain things happening for past 1 year on behalf of varalaaru team.<br /><br />1. Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos<br /><br />When we made trip to thanjavur and pazhaiyaarai last year by this<br />time, some of us accepted that the person in thanjavur painting was<br />Rajaraja and the person in panchavan madhevi pallippadai was<br />Rajendra based on the location and 'who else it could be' basis. But<br />for some of us, it was not convincing proof. So, i just wanted to<br />let them understand what all they have to accept if they start<br />accepting without considering other negative evidences. So, I posted<br />a picture of Buddha statue with chakra mark in it. As Rajaraja also<br />had sangu chakra rekhai in his palms according to Thiruvalangadu<br />copper plates, i told it has to be considered as Rajaraja. People<br />started disproving the statement and gave valid points why it cannot<br />be Rajaraja. I was happy and hoped that people would apply the same<br />rules for the issues raised during the trip too. So, I ended the<br />drama with explanation of my actual intention.<br /><br />Swetha oru dheerkka dharisi. Her words<br /><br />"Kamal, neenga Japan ponalum intha pavam ungalai uruthu vanthu<br />oottum!"<br /><br />has become true now. I have changed the description of the pictures.<br />So, new members won't get misguided.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />2. Rajaraja and Karuvoor thevar painting<br /><br />It was told that the young man and old man in thanjavur painting<br />were Rajaraja and his spiritual guru Karuvoor thevar. But from<br />inscriptions of Rajarajeswaram, we knew that Rajaraja's guru<br />was 'Eesana siva pandithar' and not Karuvoor thevar. Karuvoor thevar<br />was not mentioned in any of Rajaraja period inscriptions. It clearly<br />proves that there was no relationship between Rajaraja and<br />Karuvooraar even if a person by name Karuvoor thevar lived during<br />that period. Thiruvisaippaa was quoted for proof. When i went<br />through that, i misunderstood Thirubhuvanam with Thiru poovanam.<br />When Venkatesh notified that, I couldn't reply immediately as i<br />became busy at work and some personal commitments. After that, new<br />threads were started and i forgot to reply to that. Anyway, I accept<br />that it was my mistake.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />3. Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu.<br /><br />Satish wrote this in his reply to Venkateswaran Kasirajan last week.<br />At first, SPS introduced Dr.Kudavoil Balu to varalaaru.com team<br />during mid 2004. Then, varalaaru team met Dr.Balu during December<br />2004 and early January 2005 while bringing special issue for<br />Rajarajeswaram. In all these three meetings, Dr.Balu mentioned that<br />Periya koyil was built based on Magudagamam concept. We requested<br />him to show the book. At that time, he said it is in Sanskrit. As of<br />now, in tamilnadu, only his guru Dr.Nagasamy can read and understand<br />that and even he himself cannot read it. When we met Dr.Kalaikkovan<br />on 26th January in Trichy as part of our 5 days mega trip, we asked<br />if he knows anything about Magudagamam. He said he also heard it<br />from Dr.Balu only during Big temple Kudamuzhukku around 10 years<br />ago. At that time itself he asked but couldn't see the book till<br />date. Whenever we discussed with Dr.Kalaikkovan about magudagamam<br />concept, he never told that it doesn't exist. He always told that he<br />hasn't seen it yet. Satish joined us in one or two trips during the<br />thiruvalanjuzhi research. At that time, we are not sure if<br />Dr.Kalaikkovan told satish like this. Satish only knows. In his<br />article also, he didn't mention that it does not exist. He just<br />wanted to see it.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />4. Varalaaru article claims that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s life was very well documented<br /><br />Venkatesh raised this point in his reply to Satish's mail and he<br />tried to disprove saying "then why are we groping in the dark about<br />most of the details of his life and death?". I don't think anywhere<br />in the article it is mentioned that all the events in his life were<br />very well documented. It says only his significant achievements were<br />documented. Though unusually Rajaraja documented extensively, we<br />cannot expect him to mention when did he catch cold, how many times<br />he sneezed and all. I request to read the articles properly before<br />making such sweeping statements.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />5. Who else it could be? Rajaraja and Rajasimma<br /><br />In his second mail to VK, Satish quoted that when Dr.Kalaikkovan<br />said that the statue of a king in Dharmaraja radham is Rajasimma<br />on 'who else it could be' basis, we accepted. In the same way, when<br />he said that painting in periya koyil is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> on the same basis, we<br />didn't accept. With this, he came to a conclusion that<br />Dr.Kalaikkovan accepts assumptions indirectly.<br /><br />Dear Satish,<br /><br />Do you really think both 'Who else it could be' are same? I am not<br />sure if you have read the book 'Adhyandha kaamam' completely.<br />Otherwise, you wouldn't have raised this point. I give the summary<br />of points considered before concluding it is Rajasimma. If you are<br />not convinced still, it is my inability to explain as I don't have<br />the book with me right now and please go through the book.<br /><br />Labeled Royal Portraits are usually met with only on prominent parts<br />of the temple such as the walls or the niches. You may refer to<br />Mahavaraaha temple at Mamallapuram and several other temples in the<br />cholamandalam (Thiruvaavaduthurai, Thiruvisaloor, Konerirajapuram,<br />etc). Dr. Kudavoil Balu himself has mentioned a few such labeled<br />portraits carved on the walls of the temple towers at Chidambaram in<br />his book entitled 'Goburakkalai marabu'.<br /><br />Though labeled portrait sculptures are detected so far in the greeva<br />naasikaas or koodu in the kapodha, male figures worshipping linga<br />are depicted in many temples. Thiruvalanjuzhi is a good example<br />where one can identify many such figures. Don't you think that one<br />should take much care before identifying a figure as a particular<br />royal person? Is this not his duty to provide enough evidences to<br />substantiate such identity before it is questioned?<br /><br />In the case of adhyandha kaamam, the creator of the temple was<br />identified after a thorough analysis of its architecture, iconology<br />and epigraphic records. This and the titles (Srimega, Sri Trilokya<br />vardhana and Vidhi) engraved on the niche where the sculpture is<br />placed, helped to confirm the portrait figure as Rajasimma.<br /><br />Ram is translating the chapter 'Nizhalum Nijamum' from the<br />book 'Adhyandha kaamam' as Dr. Michael Lockwood asked for the<br />English version. We will send it soon.<br /><br />Now, let us see the case of rajarajeswaram. In the saanthaaram<br />paintings, two persons are said to be Rajaraja.<br /><br />a. Person worshipping Nataraja<br /><br />Appearance of the person worshipping Nataraja has no dissimilarities<br />with Cheraman peruman naayanar portrayed in Sundarar panel. Cheraman<br />peruman was also a king. We cannot say only Rajaraja worshipped<br />Nataraja. So, it can be any king. All we can say is one king is<br />portrayed. That's all. 'Who else it could be' argument is<br />inappropriate here. We know for sure that two persons in other side<br />panel is Sundarar and Cheraman because we know the theme behind it<br />and other pieces of paintings in that panel are also supporting<br />this. This worshipping panel may also have some theme behind it.<br />Unless a complete study like 'Adhyandha kaamam' is carried out, we<br />cannot say who is who. Not only panel, which has that person, entire<br />panel in the wall has to be studied properly without any<br />preconceived notion. Even when the well known sundarar panel was<br />studied by Dr.Kalaikkovan, we encountered lot of stunning details.<br />They are going to be published in his book 'Vaanan vandhu vazhi<br />thandhu' shortly.<br /><br />b. Young man and old man<br /><br />The two persons are said to be Rajaraja and his guru karuvoor<br />thevar. Already it is proved that there is no relationship between<br />these two. The attire and hairstyle doesn't match with a king.<br />Moreover, Dr.Kudavoil Balu proved that they are 'Sanakaadhi<br />munivargal'. I am not sure if he has written any article on this.<br />But when varalaaru team met him in thanjavur for second or third<br />time, he explained how he concluded that they are sanakaadhi<br />munivargal. All his points were very much valid and acceptable. You<br />can ask him when you meet next time.<br /><br />So, from this, we can conclude that both cannot be said to be<br />Rajaraja and both 'who else it could be' are not same.<br /><br />Here, i would like to have a disclaimer. We are in the beginning<br />stage of learning historical research methodologies and subject. Our<br />explanation capabilities are limited. So, please do not go by our<br />statements which are not complete or quoted in different scenario.<br />When you encounter such things, please look at the source or ask for<br />more explanation. Because, already such confusion occurred in the<br />past regarding podhikai. In Pullamangai and Thiruvalanjuzhi, we had<br />less time and had lot of things to see other than podhikai. So, I<br />couldn't explain well. In that case, consulting the articles of<br />Kattadakkalai series would be helpful. Hope you understand my point.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />6. School of thought and ego clash<br /><br />Venkatesh used to mention about "School of thought" in couple of his<br />mails in the sense we are adherents of Dr.Kalaikkovan's school of<br />thought. So, we hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu during his talk in tanjore.<br />I really don't understand where the scope for school of thought is<br />in the current scenario.<br /><br />Dear Venkatesh,<br /><br />Which one do you mean by 'School of thought' here? If you<br />say 'Rajaraja was ego-centric person. So, he might have projected<br />him somewhere in his masterpiece temple', that is school of thought.<br />If you say 'Tholkappiyam has words like 'enmanaar pulavar'. So it<br />may belong to 7th century AD', that is school of thought. If you<br />say 'Thirukkural uses some of Jainism concepts. So, thiruvalluvar<br />may be a Jain', that is school of thought. But how can Magudagamam<br />and pon vimaanam concept be considered as School of thought when we<br />have evidences to disprove the role of Magudagamam in big temple?<br /><br />And you said 'at last the clash of the egos has come to the<br />forefront'. It is not so. As i stated in the point 3, this issue was<br />brought out around 10 years before when the reference of magudagamam<br />was first quoted in Big temple Kumbabishekam malar. Many scholars<br />witnessed this. What do you mean by 'behind the scene and proxy<br />squabbling'? What is the necessity for us to hide and fight? Didn't<br />we ask these questions directly to Dr.Kudavoil Balu? If our<br />questions were answered already, why are we asking again and again?<br />Moreover, none of our questions are unanswerable during our times or<br />as difficult as finding Tutankhamen tomb.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />7. Varalaaru team hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu<br /><br />Dear Venkatesh,<br /><br />In the same mail, you said 'so many times we have all discussed how<br />Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled'. I frankly say that till this point<br />of time, we really don't understand how did we hassle him. You told<br />many times that we hassled him. But never told how. Even when Ram<br />asked you directly in the beach meeting, it was not responded<br />properly and topic got diverted. You said 'not only me. All of us<br />felt like that'. When I checked with some of the members, they said<br />they didn't think that Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled. I already<br />explained in the earlier messages. I am repeating here. Till this<br />date, varalaaru team is in good relationship with Dr.Kudavoil Balu.<br />We met couple of times even after our tanjore trip. If we are not<br />respecting him, why should we bring special issue on him? Why should<br />he allow us to publish his articles in guest section? Why should we<br />meet him again when we went to thanjavur? And I used to hear offline<br />comments like whatever Dr. Kudavoil Balu says, varalaaru team<br />doesn't accept. It is not true. When he says anything with proper<br />supportive evidences, we always accepted them. Best example is the<br />Sanakaadhi munivargal in the painting. If we oppose him blindly, why<br />should we accept this?<br /><br />Satish may know that we ask many questions before accepting any info<br />told by even Dr.Kalaikkovan. How can cross verification be<br />considered as hassling? Dr.Balu is a well experienced scholar in the<br />field of epigraphy. His hard work cannot be discarded by anyone.<br />Already we asked him these questions we have asked here. He would<br />have faced lot of such questions from scholars like Subbarayalu as<br />well as beginners like us. He knows how to handle it. In spite of<br />all these, if you still want to believe that he was hassled, well,<br />go ahead. We don't have any objections.<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru<br />team<br /><br />I think this is the most important thing to be clarified. Because,<br />we are directly blamed here. Couldn't believe when we read the<br />following lines from SPS's mail. Immediately thought of asking 'You<br />too SB sir?'.<br /><br />"Last year by this time we visited Thanjai ... we were thrilled to<br />go... after returning as Vencat rightly observed of various schools<br />of thoughts surfaced in open, some new members could not understand<br />the intricacies ... there was some discomfort."<br /><br />Also, it was painful to hear from a PSVP member who is in close<br />friends circle that 'because of Ram's questions only, members lost<br />interest in proceeding further and not co-operating to materialize<br />anything from PSVP'.<br /><br />Another statement from a member who didn't participate in the trip.<br />We don't know whether to laugh or worry. 'That was ponniyin selvan<br />tour. Varalaaru team unnecessarily involved history and spoiled the<br />mood of the trip'. If so, why was Dr. Kudavoil Balu invited? Did he<br />explain how did kalki write <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>?<br /><br />I am asking the following questions to all PSVP members.<br /><br />Dear all PSVP members,<br /><br />For the sake of argument, let us assume that we had hassled Dr.<br />Kudavoil Balu. But, because of that,<br /><br />Why should PSVP members get demoralised? Do you expect us not to ask<br />any questions? Where is the research without asking questions? Can<br />any student learn the subject properly without asking questions? If<br />SPS hadn't asked me and Lavanya the question 'Is Ravidasan real or<br />fictitious?' on 28th Jan 2003, what would we be doing now? Do you<br />think whatever scholars say have to be accepted without cross<br />verifying? Does cross verification mean insulting or questioning the<br />credibility of the scholar? Then what is the need of question time<br />in the conferences after presentation of each paper? Didn't<br />varalaaru team face such difference of opinions surfacing in open?<br />Wasn't the article presented by me and Pavithra in the Tamilnadu<br />history congress conference torn into pieces by scholars? Weren't<br />their questions answered patiently by us? Did we get demotivated<br />because of that? Didn't we co-operate to bring out varalaaru.com<br />after that? Do you think 2 years journey of varalaaru.com was a cake<br />walk? Did we bring out 400 articles just like that without any<br />struggle? How can things like big temple be achieved if just one<br />incident demotivates you all?<br /><br />Since couple of our discussions with Dr.Kudavoil Balu were visible<br />to some members, above conclusion was reached. What would have<br />happened if our meetings with Dr.Rajavelu, Iravadham Mahadevan,<br />Michael Lockwood, and Dr.K.Rajan etc were seen? We would not be<br />surprised even by the comment like 'because of varalaaru team only,<br />flow of mails is less in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group'. Though we couldn't control, me<br />and Ram refrained ourselves from asking any question to<br />Mr.S.Ramachandran in T.Nagar meeting regarding his speech about<br />letters in the inscriptions. Otherwise, it would have been possible<br />to hear comment like 'because of me and Ram only, not many members<br />enrolled for inscriptions reading course'.<br /><br />This is also one of the reasons why we don't inform the group about<br />our trips. Many members expressed their interest to participate in<br />our trips and asked to inform in advance. We also thought of doing<br />so. But after seeing these things, we changed our mind to avoid such<br />unnecessary comments. Apologies to those who were interested.<br /><br />Varalaaru team always wanted to help PSVP in all possible ways. It<br />is your responsibility or interest to ask what you need from us or<br />what do you want us to do. If you really feel that we are thorn in<br />the flesh, it is not so difficult to sideline or avoid 5 of us and<br />make things happen and continue the great work.<br /><br />Hope you all understand what I tried to say. Though some names are<br />mentioned explicitly, no personal offense is meant.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />All new Yahoo!

Felt Happy!<br />Now criticising .. Unhappy ?! No .. Nice that you sought<br />clarification. Thanks for providing the opportunity:<br /><br />Main Word is "OPEN " in my message ..<br /><br />For us, you and me included, really interested in knowing the Truth,<br />whatever we discuss will look alright including expressions of<br />opposite stands.. because we meet and express things quite often. But<br />for new comers - including such of those who flew from as far place<br />from Mumbai and enrolled membersship in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> to join the tour - such<br />differences may appear as if there is division.<br /><br />I recall onething in the trip : <br />Just then we were enchanted by the Architecture marvel.. we were<br />thrilled by 81 dance postures .. <br />Kamal and Ram did the explaining of the paintings to our group  <br /><br />" People may think it is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and his Queens .. There is no conclusive<br />evidence ..<br />People may think this is Karuvurar and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, there is no conclusive<br />evidence ..<br />Some of the members opined it is likely to be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> .."<br /><br />I would have preferred <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> guide to do his <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> and then we share our<br />views ... I meant this when I put the word OPEN. I do not regret Dear<br />Kamal... Nobody's view - Dr. Nagaswamy - Dr. Kudavoil - Dr. Kvn or <br />Dr. Rjvelu 's view is conclusive on this because nothing is supported<br />by any inscriptional evidence..<br /><br />In ground level, Ram asked me it may be Kulothunga also .. !  <br /><br />You yourself gracefully admit that we are all students .. not Scholars .. <br /><br />That is why we have to discuss among ourselves before bringing out<br />things with the scholars ....<br /><br />Beyond this I want to put the Lakshman Rekha ..for myself.<br /><br />But there are interesting issues :<br /><br />1. Was it <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or not ? I vote for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> because in the opposite side<br />wall painting similar looking person is sitting in devotion in front<br />of Peruvudyar. Cheramanperumal is out of the list.<br /><br />2. Was it Sanakadhi munivars .. In the book (1973) Themizhaga koir<br />kalaigal, Dr. Nagaswamy observed that they were Karuvurar and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. Now<br />they are viewed as Sanakaadhi munivars by him, Dr Kudavoil and Dr Kkvn<br />included...<br /><br />My view is : In <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s life there are three impt segments :<br /><br />i. ARUMOZHI : Pre 985 - Ponniyinselvan - Darling of Chozha crowd<br />ii. RAJARAJAN : 985 - 1006 AD . Commencing Big temple construction.<br />More as a Wattior.. King of Kings .. 1006 to 1010 Transition to<br />Sivapathasekaran.<br /><br />iii. SIVA PATHASEKARAN 1010 - 1014?<br />This is a crucial period .. <br /><br />We are discussing of " .. Ezhundaruliya thirumundril .. " "<br />Periyadevar ..Godification. " etc. In this process, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> might have<br />preferred to be identified more as a Sivanadiyar .. His grant to<br />Thiruchengottangudi - Seeradevar etc., are all need to be studied in<br />detail apart from Thiruvisalur - Thiruvalanchuzhi - Papanasam<br />inscriptions .<br /><br />I think Kalki also thought of this and introduces Mahendra as<br />Sivanadiyar (apart from conversion from Jain to Sivam ) in Sivakamiyin<br />Sabadam .. <br /><br />Therefore I opine the person with Beard might be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and the person<br />with Royal illumination in face might have been Rajendra - both SIVA<br />PAATHA SEKARAN and SIVA SARANA SEKARAN would have considered<br />themselves as the Disciples of Dakshinamurthy or so they Artists<br />depicted them.<br /><br />It is purely my view ..but the Paintings might have been from Rajendra<br />period - prior to <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram">GKC</acronym> in memory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> ! <br /><br />Expecting more to hear ..<br /><br />Re other points I prefer to go under the rug..<br /><br />Mikka anbudan, sps</div>
