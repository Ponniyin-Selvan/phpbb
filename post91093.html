			<div class="content">Hi,<br />I am not sure about what the impact would have been if education was in Tamil or any other indian language instead of English. Probably many of our friends who are now in US, UK, and all other places would not have gone to such places and would be staying in seermigu Tamil Nadu. India as such would be only a tourist destination for foreigners and there would be no Multi National Companies here.<br />Also our culture would have been entirely different. There would be no English movies in theatres. And also all the TV presentations would have been in good tamil instead of like enakku tamil avvalavaa varaadu type.<br />Negatively, we would not be chatting/discussing here in this group for probably there would have been no ponniyinselvan group or Positively we would be conversing, chatting, typing everything in our mothertoungue Tamil.<br />But regarding <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> I can definitely say that it would not have created this much interest in the minds of the readers if it had been in English. I read the English version of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> but did not quite enjoy it. I am not criticising the English version. Surely it is a varaprasaadam for those who cannot read Tamil. But it cannot capture the true essence. Also in the English version i found lots of tamil words, it was actually like reading a tanglish version. Surely there are some words in tamil for which there is no equivalent English wrod. As you said the Natural flavor or spark comes only with Tamil.<br />Kalkiyoda Nadai, Varnanai all those is very difficult to capture in English.<br />Regarding the other languages, there is a mention about prakrutham by Kalki in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>. Most of the jain scriptures are in Prakrutham only and jaina munivargal know this language even now. there are few places where they teach this language.<br />Regards,<br />Poonguzhali<br />mathava ramanan  wrote:Dear All,<br />When our common interest is with Ponniyin<br />Selvan, and Kalki's great contribution to Tamil and<br />making us all love in classical historical novel, I<br />begin to think of it in relation to Gandhi's Opinion<br />on education in English.<br />"I find daily proof of the increasing & continuing<br />wrong being done to the millions by our false<br />de-Indianizing education."<br />More at,<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br />I wonder, with the same thoughts, had <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> been written<br />in English,by "KALKI" if it would have generated the<br />same interest among us?<br />Afterall there are English works by writers like RK<br />Narayanan and others,but I doubt if it could match the<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> "spark" as we see it here.May be we need to accept<br />that the "natural flavour" or "sparks" comes only with<br />mother tongue.<br /><br />May be we need to think on more Tamil Classics and<br />popularising the kinds of historical novels as novels<br />more specifically,than just historical<br />facts.Ofcourse,visits to places mentioned in<br />historical novels helps us to know facts from<br />fictions.<br /><br />I also wonder at the different languages mentioned in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>?I am sure there might be more than Tamil?But have<br />no idea,what other languages??????<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />Mathav<br /><br /><br />=====<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Nothing will benefit human health or increase the chances for survival of life on earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet-A.Einstein.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/">http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do you Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo!

Probably many of our<br />  friends who are now in US, UK, and all other places<br />  would not have gone to such places and would be<br />  staying in seermigu Tamil Nadu. India as such would<br />  be only a tourist destination for foreigners and<br />  there would be no Multi National Companies here.<br />  Also our culture would have been entirely different.<br />  There would be no English movies in theatres. And<br />  also all the TV presentations would have been in<br />  good tamil instead of like enakku tamil avvalavaa<br />  varaadu type.<br />  Negatively, we would not be chatting/discussing here<br />  in this group for probably there would have been no<br />  ponniyinselvan group or Positively we would be<br />  conversing, chatting, typing everything in our<br />  mothertoungue Tamil.<br />  But regarding <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> I can definitely say that it would<br />  not have created this much interest in the minds of<br />  the readers if it had been in English. I read the<br />  English version of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> but did not quite enjoy it. I<br />  am not criticising the English version. Surely it is<br />  a varaprasaadam for those who cannot read Tamil. But<br />  it cannot capture the true essence. Also in the<br />  English version i found lots of tamil words, it was<br />  actually like reading a tanglish version. Surely<br />  there are some words in tamil for which there is no<br />  equivalent English wrod. As you said the Natural<br />  flavor or spark comes only with Tamil.<br />  Kalkiyoda Nadai, Varnanai all those is very<br />  difficult to capture in English.<br />  Regarding the other languages, there is a mention<br />  about prakrutham by Kalki in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>. Most of the jain<br />  scriptures are in Prakrutham only and jaina<br />  munivargal know this language even now. there are<br />  few places where they teach this language.<br />  Regards,<br />  Poonguzhali<br />  mathava ramanan  wrote:Dear<br />  All,<br />  When our common interest is with Ponniyin<br />  Selvan, and Kalki&#39;s great contribution to Tamil and<br />  making us all love in classical historical novel, I<br />  begin to think of it in relation to Gandhi&#39;s Opinion<br />  on education in English.<br />  "I find daily proof of the increasing & continuing<br />  wrong being done to the millions by our false<br />  de-Indianizing education."<br />  More at,<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br />  I wonder, with the same thoughts, had <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> been<br />  written<br />  in English,by "KALKI" if it would have generated the<br />  same interest among us?<br />  Afterall there are English works by writers like RK<br />  Narayanan and others,but I doubt if it could match<br />  the<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> "spark" as we see it here.May be we need to<br />  accept<br />  that the "natural flavour" or "sparks" comes only<br />  with<br />  mother tongue.<br /> <br />  May be we need to think on more Tamil Classics and<br />  popularising the kinds of historical novels as<br />  novels<br />  more specifically,than just historical<br />  facts.Ofcourse,visits to places mentioned in<br />  historical novels helps us to know facts from<br />  fictions.<br /> <br />  I also wonder at the different languages mentioned<br />  in<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>?I am sure there might be more than Tamil?But have<br />  no idea,what other languages??????<br /> <br />  Best Wishes,<br />  Mathav<br /> <br /> <br />  =====<br />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  Nothing will benefit human health or increase the<br />  chances for survival of life on earth as the<br />  evolution to a vegetarian diet-A.Einstein.<br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/">http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  __________________________________________________<br />  Do you Yahoo!?<br />  Yahoo!

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by mathava ramanan  using id smaramanan</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear All,<br />Thank you Sridhar for sharing thoughts and<br />mentioning,the time immortality of Tamil language as<br />Kalthonri man thonra kaalathe mun thonriya mootha<br />mozhi.....<br /><br />It definitely makes one feel proud.<br /><br />As for feeling on "foregin crazy" attitude. I don't<br />think its a curse or it applies to everyone.Some are<br />upholding the land's<br />traditions,cultures,langues,etc...thats one reason as<br />pointed for the growth of Tamil to internet from<br />Olaisuvadi...But my point is there are many,who do<br />have this "foreign crazy" attitude...still...the sad<br />part is they represent the "elites" or "imitators".<br />Which I wanted to think from,<br /><br />Gandhi's,(before 1950s)<br />Hundreds of youth believe that without the Knowledge<br />of English. freedom of India is practically<br />impossible.<br />Education through a foreign Language entails a certain<br />degree of strain, and our boys have to pay dearly for<br />it. To a large extent, they lose the capacity of<br />shouldering any other burden afterwards., for they<br />become a useless lot who are weak of body, without any<br />zest for work and imitators of the West. They have<br />little interest in original research or deep<br />thinking, and the qualities of courage, perseverance.<br />bravery and fearlessness are lacking. That is why we<br />are unable to make new plans or carry our projects to<br />meet our problems.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If Mahatma's words spoken more than 50 years is<br />difficult and may be even painful to accept.<br />But what about,the questions of the President as a<br />Scientist in 1998,just few years before...<br /><br />Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign<br />things?<br />Is it a legacy of our colonial years? We want foreign<br />television sets. We<br />want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why<br />this obsession with<br />everything imported? Do we not realise that self<br />respect<br />comes with self reliance?<br /><br />Cann't we get answers from Mahatma's and President's<br />words.(May be this is one reason,why President likes<br />to talk to Children who are unspoilt(or before the<br />influence) with this "foreign craze")<br /><br />Again on Gandhi's words,lays lots of answer..for me to<br />not call it a curse,its just our "thinking" from the<br />education,media,hald learnt(or articulated)<br />history,etc.<br /><br />The foreign medium has caused brains fag, put an undue<br />strain upon the nerves of our children, made them<br />crammers and imitators, unfitted them for original<br />work and thought, and disabled them for filtrating<br />their learning to the family or the masses. The<br />foreign medium has made our children practically<br />foreigners in their own lands. It is the greatest<br />tragedy of the existing system. Among the many evils<br />of foreign rule, this blighting imposition of a<br />foreign medium upon the youth of the country will be<br />counted by history as one of the greatest.<br /><br />May be one hasn't "still" come to the period which<br />Mahatma is referring as "counted by history".<br /><br />Brains have been made to what Mahatma calls as "daily<br />proof" for more than 50 years has taken a toll,that<br />people find it hard to understand/accept what Mahatma<br />is talking about.<br /><br />How did,people who constructed Big Temples,dams,ships<br />acquired the knowledge?<br />India's contribution to the world of science and<br />technology is as immeasurable as any other<br />contributions.Remember the number systems being taught<br />as Arabic was learnt from Indians.Europeans learnt it<br />from Arabs.<br /><br />Did we know that colonizers had to "engineer" against<br />many obstracles during their initial periods of<br />149x,not to mention their engieering skills in ship<br />building to carry them across the rough seas,but also<br />against the "foreign" languages??????<br /><br />And more reasons for the introduction of "English"<br />among the masses are mentioned in the wonderful(might<br />be hard and difficult to accept at different<br />pages),book by Michael Adas,"Machines as the measure<br />of men".<br /><br />I think,<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group could think in terms of finding<br />answers to<br />How did the transformation that we see today had taken<br />place in Chola Nadu???from its great heights???<br />What can be learnt????<br /><br />If our language from Chola period had changed,why did<br />it change?????<br /><br />If languages needs to be replaced,why????how its<br />done????whats the time period????<br />Who gains?????Who loses?????on what???Why???<br /><br />It might be easy to accept that the "natural flavour"<br />is distinctly seen in reading a classical novel like<br />Kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>,but I wonder what makes it difficult to<br />learn from those words to our present situations???<br />Should we look at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as mere piece of writing...None<br />would say so,afterall its a master piece for knowing<br />the social,political,economic,spiritual what many<br />conditions of the not so old<br />Tamils(afterall,Thirukkural age is as Twice as the<br />time period of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>)<br />My purpose is to "learn" and "share".I spent time in<br />learning some Hindi and French and some "cheap books<br />on contents,but paying more money" on those fanssy<br />"English" titles like Famous 5s,Secret 7setc..,but was<br />stupid not to have spent some time on classics like <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />or others...<br /><br />I hope to hear more from members,if you all had the<br />patience to read till now...<br /><br />I

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by mathava ramanan  using id smaramanan</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear All,<br />Wishing all the participants best<br />wishes for the wonderful opportunities to interaction.<br /><br />Pavithra,Thank you very much for some<br />additional inputs to my learning process...<br />on the discussion group especially from people who<br />have read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>,as it helps them to compare the<br />historical significance to the present.<br /><br />I would also like to share some more thoughts as they<br />come across my brain which definitely needs some rest<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />1. To the idea, that language would be needed to<br />spread is great.But think,if language is only for<br />spreading???Whats the role of language???Does it has<br />any roles with cultural preparations???<br />If one has to behave as "English", then the society<br />needs to be prepared for "English" tastes??If I<br />understand correctly, this is one reason for language<br />spread,apart from what you mentioned.So it might be<br />that it is to "complete" or even "begin".<br /><br />2. Yes, I agree to that some tries to gain on some all<br />the time in earth's history.Even if we don't use the<br />word "gain" I think, "invasion" implies<br />gain/lose????This is what one tries to learn in<br />History I suppose....<br /><br />3. I am not sure, of the "Change is the only thing<br />that can lead to improvement"????I think this is a<br />very complicated statement,atleast for my thinking...<br />May be bacause I read somewhere,"change is the result<br />of instability".<br />But in anycase,the term "change" itself has many<br />dimensions to look for...<br />When we mean,change what change one is talking about?<br />I mean in what time-space????What change do we<br />need?What for that change???Is it a change for better<br />or worse???Change willingly accepted or forced on<br />us???<br /><br />Evolution is also a change process,so is the Erosion<br />and so are the results of these two processes????And<br />How about growth and development are also change<br />processes and whats their results???<br /><br />So if we apply this idea,in what category would the<br />changed Tamil fall into????May be both,like it did<br />develop and yet we are not that expert as those old<br />Tamils were once???I wish I know...<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />4.I agree completely that what we read moulds and<br />shapes us,but also wants to add,that<br />they(books/readings) are one factor in many others<br />which shapes us.Among others are,education one<br />receives as a<br />whole,culture,tradition,religion,family,music,dance,thenew<br />medias like TV,films,etc.....<br /><br /><br />Just one last thought,since I learnt here(didn't had<br />the facility to browse the internet,when I was in<br />Chennai,otherwise may be I would have learnt that<br />there <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, how Galileo Galilie to John of Arc suffered<br />in history with different levels of punishment,I<br />constantly try to see two sides of a coin.<br /><br />A term,I recently came across,is the "social<br />construction". To think, English is education or<br />knowledge might be a social construction or not??<br /><br />If man didn't land in moon,as some believes so,then<br />could it be a social construction????or not???<br /><br />The wonderful thing on these is one cann't say,how it<br />takes in time-space for any social construction to<br />embedd in brains...I think I need to shut my thoughts<br />as I see stars in the monitor...<br /><br />ok time to say bye,<br />Mathav<br /><br /><br />--- Pavithra Srinivasan <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear all...<br /> <br />  Mathav...<br /> <br />   If our language from Chola period had changed,why<br />  did<br />   it change?????<br /> <br /> <br />  Any country that invades and has been invaded must<br />  be subjected to changes<br />  in languages, right?

			<div class="content">Hi Mathav,<br /><br />Wonderful views. I share the same thoughts as yours.<br />I believe people have a mind block about the language and culture.<br />It is always good to learn new languages and know about cultures. And<br />it is best to respect/appreciate multiple cultures. But I guess we<br />should learn and adopt with a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more discretion.<br />We need to know where it is heading us,What our language and<br />culture means to us. Whether it is our identity or not? Once a<br />majority answers such questions in the affirmative, then a question<br />of whether our language has to be alive in future say 500 or 1000 yrs<br />from now. The answer would become very obvious.<br />I read the message about "change" and its necessity to progress.<br />There can be no doubt about the importance of "adopting". We all know<br />the word "late". I've read that we call a person who had passed away<br />as "late Mr. someone". What it means is he has been late with the<br />times. Or in other words he hasn't arrived to the current times. Or<br />it is something very similar to this. No doubt some of you would have<br />known this. But I am not here to doubt the importance<br />of "chane/adopting" even a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. But that need not be at the<br />cost of the wonderful language/culture(read liguistic tradition)<br />which has come safe across 2000 years.<br /><br />I disagree to the view that the language can survive "only when"<br />there are changes according to times. I think the people can adopt<br />new languages/culure of work,scientific temper for their living<br />keeping the language in question as pristine as ever.<br /><br />Let me give a simple example of how a language survives.I am from<br />India. But I live in Malaysia. Here we have a huge local Indian<br />community. People call Indians as Tamils. I mean it is a synonym.<br />They ask me "why pakistanis are always troubling tamils." What he<br />meant was " why pak is troubling India?" The guys mother toungue is<br />supposed to be telugu. He doesn't know telugu. Tamil is his un<br />official mother toungue. This is not tamil nadu to pretend that it is<br />quite natural.<br /><br />There are malayalees aswell who are more fluent in tamil. The<br />point I want to convey is the tamils were strict about their language<br />in this land. The others are ok to adopt any thing. It is a very good<br />nature of theirs. For eg. malayalees can adopt anything on earth. It<br />is a great nature that I respect. Very Little resistance to change.<br />But the sad side effect is the language will not survive.It is very<br />evident from this land. I felt proud at times, when I have time and<br />chance to emote, about the fact that tamils, our ancestors, knowingly<br />or unknowingly, have stood by their language. That should give the<br />wise a great <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of hint. Discretion has to follow.<br /><br />Having seen the real world example, I would definitely subscribe to<br />this school of thought.<br /><br />-Mani<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, mathava ramanan<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All,<br />  Thank you Sridhar for sharing thoughts and<br />  mentioning,the time immortality of Tamil language as<br />  Kalthonri man thonra kaalathe mun thonriya mootha<br />  mozhi.....<br /> <br />  It definitely makes one feel proud.<br /> <br />  As for feeling on "foregin crazy" attitude. I don&#39;t<br />  think its a curse or it applies to everyone.Some are<br />  upholding the land&#39;s<br />  traditions,cultures,langues,etc...thats one reason as<br />  pointed for the growth of Tamil to internet from<br />  Olaisuvadi...But my point is there are many,who do<br />  have this "foreign crazy" attitude...still...the sad<br />  part is they represent the "elites" or "imitators".<br />  Which I wanted to think from,<br /> <br />  Gandhi&#39;s,&#40;before 1950s&#41;<br />  Hundreds of youth believe that without the Knowledge<br />  of English. freedom of India is practically<br />  impossible.<br />  Education through a foreign Language entails a certain<br />  degree of strain, and our boys have to pay dearly for<br />  it. To a large extent, they lose the capacity of<br />  shouldering any other burden afterwards., for they<br />  become a useless lot who are weak of body, without any<br />  zest for work and imitators of the West. They have<br />  little interest in original research or deep<br />  thinking, and the qualities of courage, perseverance.<br />  bravery and fearlessness are lacking. That is why we<br />  are unable to make new plans or carry our projects to<br />  meet our problems.<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  If Mahatma&#39;s words spoken more than 50 years is<br />  difficult and may be even painful to accept.<br />  But what about,the questions of the President as a<br />  Scientist in 1998,just few years before...<br /> <br />  Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign<br />  things?<br />  Is it a legacy of our colonial years? We want foreign<br />  television sets. We<br />  want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why<br />  this obsession with<br />  everything imported? Do we not realise that self<br />  respect<br />  comes with self reliance?<br /> <br />  Cann&#39;t we get answers from Mahatma&#39;s and President&#39;s<br />  words.&#40;May be this is one reason,why President likes<br />  to talk to Children who are unspoilt&#40;or before the<br />  influence&#41; with this "foreign craze"&#41;<br /> <br />  Again on Gandhi&#39;s words,lays lots of answer..for me to<br />  not call it a curse,its just our "thinking" from the<br />  education,media,hald learnt&#40;or articulated&#41;<br />  history,etc.<br /> <br />  The foreign medium has caused brains fag, put an undue<br />  strain upon the nerves of our children, made them<br />  crammers and imitators, unfitted them for original<br />  work and thought, and disabled them for filtrating<br />  their learning to the family or the masses. The<br />  foreign medium has made our children practically<br />  foreigners in their own lands. It is the greatest<br />  tragedy of the existing system. Among the many evils<br />  of foreign rule, this blighting imposition of a<br />  foreign medium upon the youth of the country will be<br />  counted by history as one of the greatest.<br /> <br />  May be one hasn&#39;t "still" come to the period which<br />  Mahatma is referring as "counted by history".<br /> <br />  Brains have been made to what Mahatma calls as "daily<br />  proof" for more than 50 years has taken a toll,that<br />  people find it hard to understand/accept what Mahatma<br />  is talking about.<br /> <br />  How did,people who constructed Big Temples,dams,ships<br />  acquired the knowledge?<br />  India&#39;s contribution to the world of science and<br />  technology is as immeasurable as any other<br />  contributions.Remember the number systems being taught<br />  as Arabic was learnt from Indians.Europeans learnt it<br />  from Arabs.<br /> <br />  Did we know that colonizers had to "engineer" against<br />  many obstracles during their initial periods of<br />  149x,not to mention their engieering skills in ship<br />  building to carry them across the rough seas,but also<br />  against the "foreign" languages??????<br /> <br />  And more reasons for the introduction of "English"<br />  among the masses are mentioned in the wonderful&#40;might<br />  be hard and difficult to accept at different<br />  pages&#41;,book by Michael Adas,"Machines as the measure<br />  of men".<br /> <br />  I think,<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group could think in terms of finding<br />  answers to<br />  How did the transformation that we see today had taken<br />  place in Chola Nadu???from its great heights???<br />  What can be learnt????<br /> <br />  If our language from Chola period had changed,why did<br />  it change?????<br /> <br />  If languages needs to be replaced,why????how its<br />  done????whats the time period????<br />  Who gains?????Who loses?????on what???Why???<br /> <br />  It might be easy to accept that the "natural flavour"<br />  is distinctly seen in reading a classical novel like<br />  Kalki&#39;s <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>,but I wonder what makes it difficult to<br />  learn from those words to our present situations???<br />  Should we look at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as mere piece of writing...None<br />  would say so,afterall its a master piece for knowing<br />  the social,political,economic,spiritual what many<br />  conditions of the not so old<br />  Tamils&#40;afterall,Thirukkural age is as Twice as the<br />  time period of <acronym

others...<br /> <br />  I hope to hear more from members,if you all had the<br />  patience to read till now...<br /> <br />  I wonder,when we would have an education,which would<br />  fulfill the dreams of Mahatma,Mahakavi and<br />  President????<br /> <br />  Best Wishes,<br />  Mathav<br /> <br />  --- sridhar rathinam <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    Madhav<br />    I share your veiws on

olaisuvadis as the egyptian<br />    papyrus or the sumerian tablets......<br />    As for Sanskrit in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> there is no clear mention of<br />    that in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> though there are some references to that<br />    the story.<br />    Prathakirutham may have evolved into present days<br />    marathi or kannada<br />    Yes thamil would be threatened to extinction but its<br />    a language which has sustained more than 2200 years<br />    as we know so I think it would sustain itself.But<br />    there comes the reole of e groups and networks to<br />    promote the language and heritage.<br />    The need for English I think its quite useful...its<br />    like needing hindi to survive in India you can be a<br />    foolish like me nad not learn it but the wise thing<br />    would be to learn hindi in india thats were the<br />    keralites,andras and kanadigas score over<br />    thamil....the other side of the arguement is tamil<br />    is the mother of malayalam,kannada anf telugu and<br />    thulu so should it be forced to the same status as<br />    them????<br />    The need of english is the need of the hour..atleast<br />    as far the western world is concerned Latinand greek<br />    were replaced by german in the mediaval times and<br />    then french was the supreme language of scholars and<br />    academicians that the language. english replaced it<br />    in the 18th and 19th centuray and was the prime<br />    language and was called &#39;Lingua franca&#39;&#40;explaining<br />    the importnace french had before&#41;<br />    The examples of germans,japaneses ,french and<br />    italians isnt apt...because apart from french<br />    everybody else learns english alongside their mother<br />    tongue...<br />    It helps you to propagate your language and heritage<br />    better imagine our egroup as a tahmil website..how<br />    many members we would havew lost.<br />    I agree with Pavithra that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in english will be a<br />    no no no one can match kalkis flair.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Tamil from the sangam period and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> period is<br />    different to the sopoken tamil.<br />   <br />   <br />    Is this one way of gaining on English,at Tamil or<br />    local language???How could we think of Mahakavi&#39;s<br />    developing Tamil and still loving other<br />    languages????<br />   <br />    Cheers<br />
