			<div class="content">Hi,<br />I have written what I have known. I have tried to<br />prove my point to some extent. You are most welcome to<br />correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br />Regards<br />Senthan Amudan<br /><br /><br /><br />__________________________________<br />Yahoo! Music Unlimited<br />Access over 1 million songs. Try it free.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://music.yahoo.com/unlimited/">http://music.yahoo.com/unlimited/</a><!-- m --><br />I know everybody has a different idea about the dam...but I heard that it was built this way...interestingly..I read it the same way in some magazine..some years back ...<br />Let me explain u shortly..I know there are few historians here..who wud have known about this..they cud validate my statements...it was like this....<br /><br />Though Cauvery was a perennial river during the summer months the water used to be less or sometimes no water. So they used to put big square cut boulders, in such a way that there is a space in between the boulders to act like channels for diverting.And during the rainy season the water that comes in, will remove the sand around the boulder and immerse the boulder into the soil, as the same way when we keep our feet in a sea-shore where u find that ur feet will<br />get buried down b'cos the sea water would be forcing out the soil near and below ur feet and this phenomenon occurs only with loose soil. Here too every summer they placed the boulders exactly one over the other after the previous boulders placed gets immeresed into the soil. Since it is a plain, after 12 feet there will be solid ground made of clay soil.This is exactly correct b'cos our coconut grove on the river bank[near the dam]too has clay soil below 12 feet. So even on the river bed it should be the same.<br />So when the last most boulder reaches the clay soil it wud not go down anyfurther so it starts to stay still this will be the same for the boulders placed above. At the river-bed level they wud put few more boulders which act as channels, there by diverting the water to other places.This is the way by which the boulders in place would divert the water, until the British came. Even when the British built it, they didn't put any foundation for<br />the dam all they did was to build an over bridge and put in shutters to contain the flow.The important aspect of this type of construction is, normally dams are more susceptible to Earth quakes(slightly a shake-in below the dam, not like the one in Kashmir) due to water weight. But since this has a foundation as if done naturally this dam is less susceptible.[I hope civil Engineers can give more briefing on this]<br /><br />I heard this from my Periyappa who was an Engineer at the dam and also I got that to be confirmed few years before, after I read it in a magazine. They have explained it pictorially in that magazine.(Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the magazine)<br /><br />Now let me answer few of the questions raised already in this group.<br /><br />1.Was the dam was actually built by Nayak kings while Karikalan just strengthened the bunds?<br /><br /><br />This question has to answered in a very detailed manner taking into account of the nayaks rule<br />and the local people over there at that time. After the Pandya Kingdom was destroyed by maulikafur due to the Pandya brother's fued over the throne, the Tamil Land was with out any emperor, who can rule the big land mass. The warlords who existed in Pandya reign formed themsleves to be independent rulers of their places. similar to what the Chola warlords and generals have done, immediately after the destruction of the Chola Empire. Since there was no strong opposition, the nayaks invaded Tamil nadu. They where very careful that they didn't cross over the ways of those local Chieftains. After the invasion they established themselves as the rulers of Tamil Country, but their control was within the fortress and some areas around the fortress. They had to depend on the support of the local cheiftains. Infact the local cheiftains didn't pay any tribute to the Nayaks and the Maratha rulers, from start until the British rule. Even the Greatest King of Nayak Dynasty who took up wars until Mysore was unable to contain these local cheiftains and infact he even built a very storng and big fortress around Madura and Trichirapalli to safegaurd from the warlords.The region of Kallanai should also comes under the Local Chieftains, so the possibility that the Nayak kings would have build a dam was very less,as there were frequent fueds between the Nayak Kings and the local chieftains.Even if they had did so they could have built some more channels with boulders to split the water flow, nothing more than that.<br />In saying the warlords and Chieftains, even the important Chola generals like the Mazhavarayar , Raajaleeyar, Paluvetaraiyar, Munaiyatharaiyar, Vallavaraiyar should have been the local chieftains. Infact in these Chola Areas one could still see people having their family names as Mazhavarayar , Raajaleeyar, Paluvetaraiyar, Munaiyatharaiyar, Vallavaraiyar [Which were found in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>] and adding to it some like Eelanataraiyar, Thenkondaaar, Kalathil Vendraar, Chozhagar and many such family names. And these names are also to be found in inscriptions of Chola kings and been mentioned as the generals and cheiftains in the Chola Country. So they could be the local cheiftains in Chola Country who were called as independents during Nayaks rule as per British records.Even today, the people with such family names abound near Kallanai and other surrounding areas, thats why I feel some local cheiftain among them would have had the power over that area comprising kallanai.<br /><br />References about the power of Nayak Kings and Maratha rulers: Colonel Nelson's Madura Manual, 1872<br /><br />2. The question whether actual Kallanai was at Palamaneri/Nemam?<br /><br />The Palamaneri and Nemam are two different villages situated to the north bank of the river.<br />[There is even an idea that the river's actual path was over these villages and also over Lalgudi and further Anbil on the north of Coleroon or Kollidam. Because in these areas to north of the river, one can find water in few feets of drilling. While the areas to the south of the river, drilling for water requires to be done for more feets than the northern areas.] But the present river has been split into Cauvery, Vennar, Vettar and Kollidam, if the river is not in its original track all these sub-rivers wouldn't have formed. And the present sub rivers should have formed even before 2000 years ago....thereby the sub-rivers found the path to join the sea. 2000 years is a very less time in which a river can change from it actual course and remain in a new course and split into sub rivers. And it should have caused a very worst disaster as that could have caused destruction all the way until it ends with the sea, and if that is the case definitely there would be some accounts are proofs regarding such an disaster. So we can conculde that the river's original course was the present one<br />But why do the northern areas of the river are fertile and have water in short depth?..This could be b'cos before the construction of the dams at Karnataka, the river should have overflowed(almost everyyear????), since the (reservoir) Coleroon or Kollidam is in the north of Cauvery, the excess water flows into Kollidam, while the southern banks were less affected. And many times the Kollidam too should have over flowed into the northern areas, which should have made the rich sand deposits on the northern areas near the banks and also could be reason for water being available at fewer feet depths. So I think frequent overflowing could have made people to think that the river's original course was over the Palamaneri, Nemam and other villages on the north bank which inturn could have brought in the conclusion that Kallanai too should have been built somewhere in these areas where the river flowed.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have written these things on my perspective, I may be wrong. Correct me if required.</div>

The Grand Anicut is the most <br />ancient surviving irrigation work in Kaveri river delta. It is <br />attributed to the Chola king Karikalan, and dates back to the 2nd <br />century. It is considered the oldest water-diversion structure in <br />the world still in use.<br />A poet sings<br />"Karikaalan kattivaithaan kallanai"<br /><br />Let us analyze the facts<br />The sangam literature Pattinappaalai sung by uruthirang kannanar was <br />solely sung in praise of Karikaal chola. It has no mention of <br />Kallanai. We only understand that he strengthened the banks of <br />cauvery.<br />Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates<br />Parantaka's plate is dated 932 A.D. It gives the names of the <br />progenitors of the Chola line beginning with Vishnu, followed by <br />Brahma, Marichi, Kasyapa, Surya and Usinara. Karikala, Sibi and <br />Koccengannan.<br />Karikala<br />Three important events in the life of Karikala are mentioned.<br />(1) He caused the crest of the Cholas marked on the slopes of <br />Himalayas.<br />(2) He raised embankments on either side of river Kaveri and <br />controlled its flood<br />(3) He made Kanchi a city of palaces.<br />Udayendram plates<br />Parantaka Chola's Udayendram plates mention only the name of <br />Karikala without referring to his exploits.<br /><br />Hence Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates are perhaps the <br />earliest Chola record to refer to the exploits of Karikala. Even <br />though his conquests and building Kanchi palaces are as debatable <br />let us see only Kallanai now.<br /><br />The copper plates which mention Karikala as one of the ancestors of <br />Cholas do not mention anything about Kallanai. Usually it is <br />customary to record the grandest achievements of their ancestors <br />(Sibi- sparrow, Manu needhi - chariot etc)<br /><br />One more inscription throws a different light about uruthirang <br />kannanar A mandapa was donated to kannanar by Karikala . Around 1200 <br />AD Sundara pandiyan ransacked the whole of chola kingdom. He <br />destroyed all forts, palaces etc. but left this one single mandapa <br />untouched! There is a detailed inscription in thiruvellarai - in the <br />form of a Tamil poem Â– which records this. Though it was a chola who <br />donated the gift, it was a gift for a Tamil poet - uruthirang <br />kannanar - that's all pandiyan considered!<br />Second if they measured the chola land to device an ulagalanthan <br />KOL, then there must be some mention of water sources and dams. <br />However there is no such evidence.<br /><br />Karikalan never built Kallanai. Kaverikku iru puramum karai <br />eduppiththaan.That's all. Kallanai was constructed during Nayak <br />period. That was verysmall dam and today what we see is the <br />expansion by British people. Astudent of Jawaharlal Nehru University <br />did a PhD on Kallanai and provedbeyond any doubt that it was built <br />by nayaks and subsequent expansions byBritish people.<br /><br />If we analyze the date of Karikalan , we can come to a conclusion of <br />around 9th century or later ,And the other Famous chola king Ko <br />Chenkkannan praised in sangam literature built Jambukeshwarar Temple <br />which still stands today is around 10th century AD, But the legend <br />advances the date of sangam literatue to 2nd century AD without any <br />basis.</div>

It gives the names of the<br />  progenitors of the Chola line beginning with Vishnu, followed by<br />  Brahma, Marichi, Kasyapa, Surya and Usinara. Karikala, Sibi and<br />  Koccengannan.<br />  Karikala<br />  Three important events in the life of Karikala are mentioned.<br />  &#40;1&#41; He caused the crest of the Cholas marked on the slopes of<br />  Himalayas.<br />  &#40;2&#41; He raised embankments on either side of river Kaveri and<br />  controlled its flood<br />  &#40;3&#41; He made Kanchi a city of palaces.<br />  Udayendram plates<br />  Parantaka Chola&#39;s Udayendram plates mention only the name of<br />  Karikala without referring to his exploits.<br /> <br />  Hence Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates are perhaps the<br />  earliest Chola record to refer to the exploits of Karikala. Even<br />  though his conquests and building Kanchi palaces are as debatable<br />  let us see only Kallanai now.<br /> <br />  The copper plates which mention Karikala as one of the ancestors of<br />  Cholas do not mention anything about Kallanai. Usually it is<br />  customary to record the grandest achievements of their ancestors<br />  &#40;Sibi- sparrow, Manu needhi - chariot etc&#41;<br /> <br />  One more inscription throws a different light about uruthirang<br />  kannanar A mandapa was donated to kannanar by Karikala . Around 1200<br />  AD Sundara pandiyan ransacked the whole of chola kingdom. He<br />  destroyed all forts, palaces etc. but left this one single mandapa<br />  untouched! There is a detailed inscription in thiruvellarai - in the<br />  form of a Tamil poem Â– which records this. Though it was a chola<br />who<br />  donated the gift, it was a gift for a Tamil poet - uruthirang<br />  kannanar - that&#39;s all pandiyan considered!<br />  Second if they measured the chola land to device an ulagalanthan<br />  KOL, then there must be some mention of water sources and dams.<br />  However there is no such evidence.<br /> <br />  Karikalan never built Kallanai. Kaverikku iru puramum karai<br />  eduppiththaan.That&#39;s all. Kallanai was constructed during Nayak<br />  period. That was verysmall dam and today what we see is the<br />  expansion by British people. Astudent of Jawaharlal Nehru University<br />  did a PhD on Kallanai and provedbeyond any doubt that it was built<br />  by nayaks and subsequent expansions byBritish people.<br /> <br />  If we analyze the date of Karikalan , we can come to a conclusion of<br />  around 9th century or later ,And the other Famous chola king Ko<br />  Chenkkannan praised in sangam literature built Jambukeshwarar Temple<br />  which still stands today is around 10th century AD, But the legend<br />  advances the date of sangam literatue to 2nd century AD without any<br />  basis.</div></blockquote></div>
