The theme leads to the <br />  sterling friendship of the poet with King Kopperunchozhan. <br />Building <br />  a world of imagination on the hints found in the lyrics of <br />  Pisirandaiyar, Bharatidasan presents a tale of love, hate, <br />betrayal, <br />  murder and dark humour as when the child Ponnu speaks about his <br />  mother&#39;s death. The aim throughout is to announce aloud the <br />  greatness of Tamil culture. As when we note that the ancient Tamil <br />  artisans could make life-like images in wax. Bharatidasan&#39;s <br />  favourite word-play gives pep to the dialogue. <br />  <br />  The rivalry of the Pandya and Chola kingdoms is ignited by the <br />  murder of the Pandyan girl Pachaikili by her husband due to a ruse <br />  engineered by the Chola youth Thooyan. Taking advantage of this <br />  case, the Chola Princes try to wrest power from their father. <br />  <br />  The king seeks to kill his sons, but the poet Pullatrur Eyitranar <br />  calms him down and advises him not to stain the greatness of Tamil <br />  culture by fratricide. The king accepts the admonition and decides <br />  to quit the world by withdrawing from sustenance in the time-<br />tested <br />  tradition of "vadakkiruthal.&#39;&#39; His bosom friend Pisirandaiyar of <br />  Pandyan kingdom hears of this and hurries to his side and so does <br />  another poet, Pothiyar. Both of them join the King in his resolve <br />to <br />  die. <br />  <br />  Death cannot be proud in the face of such incandescent friendship <br />  between the emperors of land and the emperors of poesy. <br />  <br />  Bharatidasan&#39;s tribute to the Sangam poet speaks of him as "Paa <br />  Vendhar" since poets were the acknowledged legislators of Moral <br />Law <br />  in ancient Tamil land. Bharatidasan&#39;s admirers have given the same <br />  sobriquet to their idol and call him Paa Vendhar Bharatidasan.<br />  <br />  ......another version<br />  <br />  Kopperunchozhan was a chozhar king &#40;c.375-345 B.C.E.&#41; <br />  He was a modest, just, and a poet king who had great poets of his <br />  time as his loyal friends. <br />  Pisir Andhaiyaar was the greatest Tamil poet of that time.He lived <br />  at a village called "Pisir" in the Pandyan Empire, near the city <br />of <br />  Poandhai in pesent Kanyakumari district. <br />  He had been a great fan of Kopperunchozhan without even having <br />seen <br />  him ever.He had considered himself a great fiend of the Chozha <br />king <br />  owing to the latter&#39;s vast knowledge in Tamizh, being a good poet <br />  and a great patron of Tamil scholars. <br />  One day, &#40;around 345 B.C.E.&#41;after having a contradiction in <br />  administrative principles with his son the crown prince <br />  Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli, and after the latter having called <br />him <br />  unfit to continue as king, the Chozhar king decided to observe <br />  fasting unto death-the ritual called as "vadakkiruththal"-a way of <br />  ending one&#39;s life with esteem, after having finished all his <br />social <br />  duties and in all gratitude for the almighty God Sivaperumanaar. <br />  The problem was that the father did not agree to the prince&#39;s wish <br />  to attack the Pandyan king of that time Pandyan Arivudai Nambi, <br />just <br />  to establish the Chozhar supremacy over him.The prince had earlier <br />  been provoked by- the Pandyan Nambi&#39;s historic victory over <br />invading <br />  North Indian Emperor, a king of the Nanda dynasty at a huge battle<br />  &#40;c. 345 B.C.E.&#41; near south Kalinga on the banks of the Krishna <br />  River, the then northern border of Thamizhagam and Nambi declared <br />  himself "the Emperor of South India". <br />  Kopperunchozhan didnot agree for an invasion on Madurai because it <br />  was not righteous to wage an unnecessary war for no reason, to <br />kill <br />  innocent soldiers and people when both countries enjoyed peace and <br />  prosperity and were in their respective golden age of fertility <br />and <br />  flourishing wealth.And afterall, the Pandyan Emperor had just done <br />  his duty on behalf of all Tamizh people to prevent the invading <br />  Nanda Emperor from entering South India and one has to pay him <br />with <br />  gratitude for establishing Tamizh supremacy over North Indian <br />  Empire; if not showing enemity towards Nambi Pandyan, <br />  But the crown prince Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli unfortunately <br />  couldnot understand the king&#39;s righteousness because of his pumped <br />  up youth and called him unfit to continue as king, <br />  So, When the king sat down for the ritual, his dear friends who <br />  could not bear the separation, and in support for their king&#39;s <br />  righteousness also sat along with him to lay down their lives too. <br />  Hearing this news, Pisirandhaiyaar hurried to Uraiyur, in order to <br />  join the ritual to die along with his dearest friend the King. <br />  On meeting the great poet for the first time, the king embraced <br />  Pisirandhaiyaar, with tears in his eyes, still unable to believe <br />  this extraordinary true and loyal heart-melting friend willing to <br />  accompany him through the path of death to the land of golden <br />  garden - the Heaven. <br />  Then both the king and his beloved friend Pisirandhaiyaar and <br />other <br />  poets sat on the South banks of River Ponni fasting unto death and <br />  reached the high Heavens together.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Vijaya Kumar,<br /><br />Vadakkiruththal is a Jain theory of leaving their body by fasting unto death. The Chola and Pisiraanthiaar may have practised the faith. But the period you have mentioned is confusing.<br /><br />No doubt the story was very famous among Tamil scholars, but the end was little different. What I have heard that the King and Poet did not see each other till their death. May be - Telepathi worked out? Venkatesh or SPS can explain more.<br /><br />Dhivakar<br /><br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote:<br />sorry - the topic should be father against son or son against father<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2003/05/02/stories/2003050201260300.<br />  htm<br /> <br />  "Pisirandaiyar" &#40;1959&#41; is about the Sangam poet who seems to have<br />  been youthful-looking even at an advanced age because of his<br />  balanced view of life and a loving family.

Bharatidasan&#39;s admirers have given the same<br />  sobriquet to their idol and call him Paa Vendhar Bharatidasan.<br /> <br />  ......another version<br /> <br />  Kopperunchozhan was a chozhar king &#40;c.375-345 B.C.E.&#41;<br />  He was a modest, just, and a poet king who had great poets of his<br />  time as his loyal friends.<br />  Pisir Andhaiyaar was the greatest Tamil poet of that time.He lived<br />  at a village called "Pisir" in the Pandyan Empire, near the city<br />of<br />  Poandhai in pesent Kanyakumari district.<br />  He had been a great fan of Kopperunchozhan without even having<br />seen<br />  him ever.He had considered himself a great fiend of the Chozha<br />king<br />  owing to the latter&#39;s vast knowledge in Tamizh, being a good poet<br />  and a great patron of Tamil scholars.<br />  One day, &#40;around 345 B.C.E.&#41;after having a contradiction in<br />  administrative principles with his son the crown prince<br />  Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli, and after the latter having called<br />him<br />  unfit to continue as king, the Chozhar king decided to observe<br />  fasting unto death-the ritual called as "vadakkiruththal"-a way of<br />  ending one&#39;s life with esteem, after having finished all his<br />social<br />  duties and in all gratitude for the almighty God Sivaperumanaar.<br />  The problem was that the father did not agree to the prince&#39;s wish<br />  to attack the Pandyan king of that time Pandyan Arivudai Nambi,<br />just<br />  to establish the Chozhar supremacy over him.The prince had earlier<br />  been provoked by- the Pandyan Nambi&#39;s historic victory over<br />invading<br />  North Indian Emperor, a king of the Nanda dynasty at a huge battle<br />  &#40;c. 345 B.C.E.&#41; near south Kalinga on the banks of the Krishna<br />  River, the then northern border of Thamizhagam and Nambi declared<br />  himself "the Emperor of South India".<br />  Kopperunchozhan didnot agree for an invasion on Madurai because it<br />  was not righteous to wage an unnecessary war for no reason, to<br />kill<br />  innocent soldiers and people when both countries enjoyed peace and<br />  prosperity and were in their respective golden age of fertility<br />and<br />  flourishing wealth.And afterall, the Pandyan Emperor had just done<br />  his duty on behalf of all Tamizh people to prevent the invading<br />  Nanda Emperor from entering South India and one has to pay him<br />with<br />  gratitude for establishing Tamizh supremacy over North Indian<br />  Empire; if not showing enemity towards Nambi Pandyan,<br />  But the crown prince Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli unfortunately<br />  couldnot understand the king&#39;s righteousness because of his pumped<br />  up youth and called him unfit to continue as king,<br />  So, When the king sat down for the ritual, his dear friends who<br />  could not bear the separation, and in support for their king&#39;s<br />  righteousness also sat along with him to lay down their lives too.<br />  Hearing this news, Pisirandhaiyaar hurried to Uraiyur, in order to<br />  join the ritual to die along with his dearest friend the King.<br />  On meeting the great poet for the first time, the king embraced<br />  Pisirandhaiyaar, with tears in his eyes, still unable to believe<br />  this extraordinary true and loyal heart-melting friend willing to<br />  accompany him through the path of death to the land of golden<br />  garden - the Heaven.<br />  Then both the king and his beloved friend Pisirandhaiyaar and<br />other<br />  poets sat on the South banks of River Ponni fasting unto death and<br />  reached the high Heavens together.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Here?s a new way to find what you're looking for - Yahoo!

King Adhiyamaan was ruling Thagadur (Presently Dharmapuri <br />District). The district got its name from the work dharmam which <br />means gifting.

Your car has remote keys?<br /><br />This may come in handy someday. Good reason to own a cell phone:<br />If u happen to lock your keys in the car and the spare keys at home,<br />call someone on your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot <br />from<br />your car door and have theother person at your home press the unlock<br />button, holding it near thephone on their end. Your car will unlock.<br /><br />Saves someone from having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no<br />object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach<br />someone who has the other "remote" for your car, you can unlock the<br />doors (or the trunk).<br /><br />Editor's Note: *It works fine! We tried it out and it unlocked our <br />car<br />over a cell phone!"<br /><br />3) HiddenBattery power<br /><br />Imagine your cell battery is very low, u r expecting an important <br />call<br />and u don't have a charger. Nokia instrument comes with a reserve<br />battery.<br />To activate,<br />press the keys *3370# Your cell will restart with this reserve and <br />the<br />instrument will show a 50% increase in battery.

The theme leads to <br />the <br />    sterling friendship of the poet with King Kopperunchozhan. <br />  Building <br />    a world of imagination on the hints found in the lyrics of <br />    Pisirandaiyar, Bharatidasan presents a tale of love, hate, <br />  betrayal, <br />    murder and dark humour as when the child Ponnu speaks about his <br />    mother&#39;s death. The aim throughout is to announce aloud the <br />    greatness of Tamil culture. As when we note that the ancient <br />Tamil <br />    artisans could make life-like images in wax. Bharatidasan&#39;s <br />    favourite word-play gives pep to the dialogue. <br />    <br />    The rivalry of the Pandya and Chola kingdoms is ignited by the <br />    murder of the Pandyan girl Pachaikili by her husband due to a <br />ruse <br />    engineered by the Chola youth Thooyan. Taking advantage of this <br />    case, the Chola Princes try to wrest power from their father. <br />    <br />    The king seeks to kill his sons, but the poet Pullatrur <br />Eyitranar <br />    calms him down and advises him not to stain the greatness of <br />Tamil <br />    culture by fratricide. The king accepts the admonition and <br />decides <br />    to quit the world by withdrawing from sustenance in the time-<br />  tested <br />    tradition of "vadakkiruthal.&#39;&#39; His bosom friend Pisirandaiyar of <br />    Pandyan kingdom hears of this and hurries to his side and so <br />does <br />    another poet, Pothiyar.
