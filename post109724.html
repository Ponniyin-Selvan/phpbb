			<div class="content">Madan, Thanks for your response. You said you wrote a long reply and discarded being a male. There is nothing wrong in posting whatever your views are. Please don't have any inhibitions. What I feel is whenever we think about an issue, our gender/sex (whether male or female) should have no effecton it. Otherwise, it might be biased. <br />By the way, I donot understand what you imply by most women tend<br />to 'think' from their heart, please clarify. <br />Regards,<br />Priya<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Madan U Sreenivasan <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Friday, September 5, 2008 2:49:47 AM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br /><br /><br />Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this<br />matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there,<br />and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (mywife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, we have a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And have you noticed there wasn&#39;t much response to this subject....? !</div></blockquote>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.<br /><br />The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend<br />to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject.

			<div class="content">Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani). Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) <br />Â <br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlikestress ridden Chennai <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else. <br />Â <br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never everseen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what doÂ we do, same ultimately.<br />Â <br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more. I beleive Shoba also said she is from there.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Anandhi Subramanian  wrote: <br /><br />From: Anandhi Subramanian <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 12:35 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malathi, <br />Â <br />Â  You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.<br />Â <br />Â  I did my MastersÂ from ADU, coimbatore.Â Unforgettable yearsin my life.<br />Â <br />Anandhi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Malathi Mahadevan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 5:21 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Arun, Coimbatore.. oh wow..I could write volumes..I grew up there...if you want to combine all the 'graamiya' movies made it would not take a candle to the conservativsm in Coimbatore as far as women go. When I went to schoolthere - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich peopleand very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was alsoÂ a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if<br />you want to relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br />Â <br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br />Â <br />More later,<br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Arun Krishnan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Arun Krishnan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 3:45 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Madan,<br /><br />Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Arun,<br /><br />Â Â  I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.<br /><br />Â Â  So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. <br /><br />Just my tuppence worth.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And have you noticed there wasn&#39;t much response to this subject....? !</div></blockquote>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.<br /><br />The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject.

			<div class="content">Actually I have mixed thoughts/experiences on that. Atleast in US. I have handled several home renovation projects and dealt with contractors - painters, electricians, plumbers etc. Be clear in communication, specific about $that is all and most of the time work gets done. I must confess I cannot possibly do that back home. I don't know how to deal with laborers in indianfashion and bargain about money. I don't bargain in India, am too soft hearted to bargain with people who sell vegetables and make a hundred times less money than I do. And what that means is to be taken for a long merry ride. <br />Â <br />In US you cannot get things done if you are condescending or patronizing. People do not like that at all. A plumber is like a software engineer. Just another profession. As long as we can remember that it is usually easy.

In Sinapore, when we lived there, the ONLY place where women were reluctant to go was to little India. My cousin summed it up succinctly.. "Kannalaye Rape panniduvaanga" .. we never found this anywhere else in Singapore.. so this has something to do with our culture.. Tamil/Indian callit what you will. Maybe the conservativeness and the segregation of sexes from a very young age, leads to suppressed feelings which comes out as boorishness.

			<div class="content">Dear Malathi , Anandhi<br />I live in Kovai now. Grew up in Chennai. We've been here only for 5+ yrs.now. <br />Kovai continues to be polite & has not lost any of the charms Malathi mentioned. The Auto drivers have changed though, I cannot say they cheat but they charge the moon, you end up paying more than you would in Chennai for thesame distance. I do not know if it is still safe at night, but mornings asearly as 5a.m. I've seen women walking alone in the race course & it is quite safe to do that. I've not seen any eveteasing in the last 5 yrs. Peoplecontinue to be conservative , I would rather use the word traditional, Â women are educated & go to work too, may be not from the affluent business families. <br />As for equality or freedom of women I'd say it totally depends on the womanto establish her individuality, while keeping the family in mind. <br />Regards<br />Shobha<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Malathi Mahadevan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 2:45 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani). Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) <br />Â <br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlikestress ridden Chennai <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else. <br />Â <br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never everseen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what doÂ we do, same ultimately.<br />Â <br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more.

When I went to schoolthere - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich peopleand very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was alsoÂ a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if<br />you want to relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br />Â <br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br />Â <br />More later,<br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/5/08, Arun Krishnan  wrote: <br /><br />From: Arun Krishnan <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Friday, September 5, 2008, 3:45 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Madan,<br /><br />Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there).

I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.<br /><br />Â Â  So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu.

I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. <br /><br />Just my tuppence worth.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />2008/9/5 Madan U Sreenivasan  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And have you noticed there wasn&#39;t much response to this subject....? !</div></blockquote>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.<br /><br />The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br /><br />2008/9/4 Priya <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks Malathi and Shri for your comments. <br /><br />Malathi, What you told about women's mindset about women's self<br />respect is greatly true. I too accept it. And have you noticed there<br />wasn't much response to this subject....? ! <br /><br />regards<br />Priya<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Shriram Rajaram <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi priya,<br />  <br />  i usually dont like to read big emails in english!! but this one is<br />tamizh doesnt make me lazy to read the entire thing!<br />  <br />  P.S: this is the same in French to me....i love to read any big emails<br />  <br />  Shri<br />  <br />  --- El miÃ©, 3/9/08, Priya Balachandran <br />escribiÃ³: <br />  De: Priya Balachandran</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Asunto: [ponniyinselvan] Men&#39;s mind set about women&#39;s self-respect<br />  Para: ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />  Fecha: miÃ©rcoles, 3 septiembre, 2008 4:01<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  à®•à®²à¯à®•à®¿ à®…à®µà®°à¯à®•à®³à®¿à®©à¯<br />à®ªà¯Šà®©à¯à®©à®¿à®¯à®¿à®©à¯ à®šà¯†à®²à¯à®µà®©à®¿à®²à¯</div></blockquote>à®ªà¯†à®£à¯à®•à®³à¯à®•à¯à®•à¯ à®šà®®à®®à®¾à®© à®‡à®Ÿà®®à¯<br />à®…à®¨à¯à®¤ à®šà¯‚à®´à®²à®¿à®²à¯<br />à®‡à®°à¯à®ªà¯à®ªà®¤à®¾à®•<br />à®•à®¾à®Ÿà¯à®Ÿà®ªà¯à®ªà®Ÿà¯à®Ÿà®¿à®°à¯à®•à¯à®•à®¿à®±à®¤à¯. <br />à®ªà®² à®‡à®Ÿà®™à¯à®•à®³à®¿à®²à¯ à®…à®µà®°à¯<br />à®ªà¯†à®£à¯à®•à®³à®¿à®©à¯<br />à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆà®•à¯à®•à¯ <br />à®®à¯à®•à¯à®•à®¿à®¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®µà®®à¯<br />à®•à¯Šà®Ÿà¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯<br />à®•à¯à®±à®¿à®ªà¯à®ªà®¿à®Ÿà¯à®•à®¿à®©à¯à®±à®¾à®°à¯. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>à®‡à®©à¯à®±à¯ˆà®¯ à®¤à®®à®¿à®´à¯<br />à®•à¯à®Ÿà¯à®®à¯à®ªà®™à¯à®•à®³à®¿à®²à¯ à®…à®¤à¯</div></blockquote>à®Žà®ªà¯à®ªà®Ÿà®¿ à®‰à®³à¯à®³à®¤à¯? à®•à®£à®µà®°à¯à®•à®³à¯<br />à®¤à®™à¯à®•à®³à¯ à®®à®©à¯ˆà®µà®¿à®¯à®¿à®©à¯<br />à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆà®¯à¯ˆ à®Žà®¨à¯à®¤<br />à®…à®²à®³à®µà¯à®•à¯à®•à¯<br />à®®à¯à®•à¯à®•à®¿à®¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®µà®®à¯<br />à®•à¯Šà®Ÿà¯à®•à®¿à®±à®¾à®°à¯à®•à®³à¯? à®¤à®©à¯à®©à¯ˆ à®µà®¿à®Ÿ<br />à®®à®©à¯ˆà®µà®¿à®¯à®¿à®©à¯ à®•à®°à¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®•à¯à®•à¯<br />à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆà®•à¯à®•à¯à®®à¯<br />à®…à®¤à®¿à®•à®®à¯ à®®à¯à®•à¯à®•à®¿à®¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®µà®®à¯<br />à®•à¯Šà®Ÿà¯à®•à®¿à®°à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾ , à®šà®®à®®à®¾à®•<br />à®¨à®¿à®©à¯ˆà®•à®¿à®°à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾ à®…à®²à¯à®²à®¤à¯<br />à®¤à®¾à®´à¯à®µà®¾à®• à®¨à®¿à®©à¯ˆà®•à®¿à®°à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾?<br />à®…à®²à¯à®²à®¤à¯ à®•à¯Šà®Ÿà¯à®ªà¯à®ªà®¤à¯à®¤à®¾à®©à¯<br />à®¨à®²à¯à®² à®ªà®£à¯à®ªà¯ à®Žà®©à¯à®ªà®¤à®¾à®²à¯ <br />à®•à¯Šà®Ÿà¯à®•à¯à®• à®®à¯à®¯à®²à¯à®•à®¿à®±à®¾à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾?<br />à®®à®©à¯ˆà®µà®¿à®•à¯à®•à¯<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆ à®‰à®£à¯à®Ÿà¯ à®Žà®©à¯à®ªà®¤à¯ˆ<br />à®ªà®²à®°à¯ à®®à®±à®¨à¯à®¤à¯</div></blockquote>à®µà®¿à®Ÿà¯à®•à®¿à®±à®¾à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾? à®®à®±à¯à®±à®µà®°à¯<br />à®®à¯à®©à¯à®©à®¿à®²à¯à®²à¯ˆà®¯à®¿à®²à¯<br />à®®à®©à¯ˆà®µà®¿à®¯à®¿à®©à¯ à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆ<br />à®•à¯‡à®Ÿà®¾à®¤à®¾à®µà®©à¯à®©à®®à¯<br />à®ªà®¾à®°à¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®•à¯Šà®²à¯à®•à®¿à®± à®…à®µà®°à¯à®•à®³à¯<br />à®¤à®¾à®©à¯ à®®à®Ÿà¯à®Ÿà¯à®®à¯ à®…à®¤à¯ˆ<br />à®ªà¯‹à®°à¯à®Ÿà¯à®ªà®¤à¯à®¤à®¾à®¤à¯<br />à®‰à®³à¯à®³à®¾à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾? à®ªà¯†à®£à¯à®•à®³à¯‡<br />à®¤à®™à¯à®•à®³à¯ à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆà®¯à¯ˆ<br />à®…à®µà®°à¯à®•à®³à¯à®³à¯à®•à¯à®•à®¾à®• à®µà®¿à®Ÿà¯à®Ÿà¯<br />à®•à¯Šà®Ÿà¯à®ªà¯à®ªà®¤à®¾à®²à¯ à®…à®¤à¯ˆ<br />à®ªà¯†à®°à®¿à®¤à®¾à®• à®Žà®£à¯à®£à¯à®µà®¤à®¿à®²à¯à®²à¯ˆà®¯à®¾?<br />à®‡à®²à¯à®²à¯ˆ à®®à®©à¯ˆà®µà®¿à®¯à®¿à®©à¯<br />à®šà¯à®¯à®®à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾à®¤à¯ˆà®•à¯à®•à¯ à®ªà®™à¯à®•à®®à¯<br />à®µà®¿à®³à¯ˆà®¯ à®•à¯‚à®Ÿà®¾à®¤à¯ à®Žà®©à¯à®ªà®¤à®¿à®²à¯<br />à®•à®°à¯à®¤à¯à®¤à®¾à®•à¯à®•<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>à®‡à®°à¯à®•à®¿à®±à®¾à®°à¯à®•à®³à®¾?<br />à®…à®©à¯ˆà®µà®°à®¿à®©à¯ à®•à®°à¯à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®•à®³à¯ˆà®¯à¯à®®à¯</div></blockquote>à®…à®±à®¿à®¯ à®†à®µà®²à®¾à®• à®‰à®³à¯à®³à¯‡à®©à¯...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>à®¨à®©à¯à®±à®¿,<br />  <br />  à®ªà®¿à®°à®¿à®¯à®¾</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Nandakumar, very well said!! <br />Â <br />I strongly believe both JJ and Indira Gandhi are men in women bodies, in other words they had to sacrifice all femininity to be where they are.

Feminine styles of leadership is not understood at all, definitely not in male dominated societies such as India and United States. Some european cultures seemed better evolved in that regard - some women I have met from France and Sweden seemed lot more confident, gentle leaders without aggression. BTW there are lots of men who are like that too who do not conform to traditional definions of being male (loud, aggressive, dominating) and yet are very good leaders in their own right. <br />Â <br />Am not sure if anyone has addressed this issue before, the #1 problem womenhave in India is sexual abuse at work. There is little/no protection from law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces abuse from male managers and co workers.

			<div class="content">Yes it is hard for a woman to succeed anywhere, even in an ordinary work situation without backing of a man. It is simple statistics there are more men than women and it is still a man's world. I am not sure if that is any more complex than that.<br />Â <br />Ravi, interesting to know that women are better strategists, sounds logicalto me since generally men are given to more direct thinking almost all thetime. Very generally that is. Am not at all sure about the marketing part,for one thing there are very few women in marketing compared to men and it would be unfair to draw any conclusion based on that.<br />Â <br />As far as generalising about innocence and other traits, well all people men or women are human. It is not possible to generalise like that. But on the other hand an advanced society provides certain options to people who arecaught in bad/troublesome situations. Unfortunately that is very much missing in India. A woman caught in a sexual abuse situation is more than likely to be stigmatised (we are Sita's country after all!!) let alone protected. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Sun, 9/7/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Sunday, September 7, 2008, 3:35 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their professional life. After K.V Kamath, till recently all the three No.2 in ICICI Bank were women. Also another fact about women is that without a backing Spouse / father /Mentor (Male) no women has won even a panjayat election. This was way backin early 90s when myÂ EnglishÂ Professor quoted a research paper.

I have<br />    heard several women say that even in the States, that since <br />climbing the<br />    corporate ladder means being a &#39;man&#39; atleast technically they <br />don&#39;t consider<br />    that progress. Feminine styles of leadership is not understood at <br />all,<br />    definitely not in male dominated societies such as India and <br />United States.<br />    Some european cultures seemed better evolved in that regard - <br />some women I<br />    have met from France and Sweden seemed lot more confident, gentle <br />leaders<br />    without aggression.

There is little/no <br />protection from<br />    law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces abuse <br />from male<br />    managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so called<br />    professional environments - the woman being married is perhaps <br />only a little<br />    safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is <br />interested <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />    But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their <br />families.<br />   <br />    Malathi<br />   <br />    --- On *Sat, 9/6/08, Nandakumar Selvaraj *wrote: <br />   <br />    From: Nandakumar Selvaraj</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men&#39;s mind set about women&#39;s <br />self-respect<br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Date: Saturday, September 6, 2008, 11:14 AM<br />   <br />   <br />    Hi,<br />   <br />    some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian <br />countries. They<br />    have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the <br />powerful and<br />    autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh <br />hasina,<br />    Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a coterie <br />group like<br />    Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up people <br />who are<br />    actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.<br />   <br />    I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but not<br />    authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many <br />times, there<br />    might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a little<br />    determination and setting up of priorities can get them to break <br />it. As<br />    Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you reach it. Nobody <br />needs to<br />    give any freedom, you just take it as it is your right as a human <br />being.<br />   <br />    Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system&#40;most <br />ill suited<br />    for women&#39;s needs&#41;. Traditional indian societies have come a long <br />way from<br />    keeping women in their kitchens.<br />   <br />    It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-teasing to <br />go away<br />    and Sex based Segregation helps promote eve-teasing and <br />aggressive behaviour<br />    in boys.<br />   <br />    If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she would <br />have not<br />    accomplished so much in her time.<br />   <br />    Regards<br />   <br />    Nanda<br />   <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: Anandhi Subramanian <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Friday, 5 September, 2008 8:09:25 PM<br />    Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men&#39;s mind set about women&#39;s <br />self-respect<br />   <br />    Priya,<br />   <br />    I was able to read the tamil version, but the subject is too <br />complicated<br />    for me to channelize my thoughts.<br />   <br />    In my opinion, women have freedom.
