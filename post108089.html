			<div class="content">Venkat, I agree with you on the last point - that Alfred Nobel being on thecommitee would have changed things. I am not sure at all about other issues. Whom do we learn about Gandhi from - a racist bigot like Churchill orÂ hypocrite/religious fundamentalist like Jinnah? Surely one has to qualify even to comment on Gandhi. <br />Â <br />Whatever we like or do not like about Gandhi, nobody can really question his integrity or purity of intent, or putting it differently perhaps - nobodycame close to that degree of integrity as Einstein said. In truth Gandhi had no 'enemies' he only opposed in principle what they did - he did not oppose the tax on salt per se, he opposed the fact that the British held monopoly to selling tax,Â  not paying that tax was a criminal offence and tax was available for free, the poorest of the poor only eat fish or rice with salt which could not be possible if they had to pay for it.<br />Â <br />Gandhi's actions lead to violence and bloodshed, well perhaps. Perhaps if Gandhi had been a saint like Ramakrishna or Gautama Buddha he could have just practised his principles spiritually and there would have been no bloodshed. But then there would have been no Martin Luther Kings or Mandelas either. <br />Â <br />The point we can award the British for essentialy is their sense of fairness which was an important part of why Gandhi's principles worked against them. Whether Gandhi would be effective against Hitler or Bin Laden is questionable, although the deep rooted principle of non violence and compassion isessentially something that will sustain over time and inspire millions, asit still is with Dalai Lama.

I read about this a few months back. The<br />    Assassination<br />        part<br />          - I dont remember, but what I remember is, it was rejected<br />          continuously based on the fact that, many a times his actions<br />    led<br />      to<br />          blood shed in the form of Hindu-muslim riots. So though he was<br />        against<br />          violence, his actions resulted in violence and hence he didnt<br />    get<br />        the<br />          noble peace prize.<br />         <br />          Regards,<br />          Satish<br />         <br />          --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Humble Groups"<br />           wrote: <br />           <br />           <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rediff.com/news/">http://www.rediff.com/news/</a><!-- m --> 2008/jul/ 22gandhi. htm<br />           <br />            "&#40;Mahatma&#41; Gandhi was short-listed for the Nobel Prize FIVE<br />        times,"<br />            Norwegian Nobel committee chief Ole Danbolt Mjos has<br />    revealed.<br />           <br />            Regards<br />            Thiru<br />           <br />           <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ponniyinselvan.in">http://www.ponniyinselvan.in</a><!-- m --><br />           <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://feeds.ponniyinselvan">http://feeds.ponniyinselvan</a><!-- m -->. in/PonniyinSelva n<br />           <br />         <br />       <br />     <br />   <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />   --<br />   "Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />   difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />   -- Benjamin Franklin</div></blockquote></div>
