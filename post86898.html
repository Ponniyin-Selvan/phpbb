			<div class="content">hi sirs,<br /><br />old thread - on VD: <br /><br />note this reference from Epigrahica indica XVI...<br /><br /><br />The princes called Vanada-Rayars were the lineal descendants of the <br />Bana kings, who, in the earlier period of South Indian History, were <br />the vassals of the Pallavas and ruled over the North Arcot District <br />and portions of the Mysore Province ; their kingdom was known as<br />Banappadi or Perumbanappadi. When the Pallavas were subverted by the <br />Cholas, they became subordinates of the Cholas, and the Vanada-<br />Rayars continued faithful to the latter till the reign of Kulottunga <br />III. Rajaraja Vanakovaraiyan, alias Ponparappinan Magadaipperamal,<br />one of the vassals of Kulottunga III, rebelled against bis suzerain <br />and entered into political compacts with some southern petty <br />princes. He drifted on to the south and appears eventually<br />to have joined the Pandyas, who were thea growing in power and were <br />soon to subvert the Chola supremacy during the reign of Rajaraja III <br />and his son Rajendra-Chola III. The Vanada-Rayars continued to be <br />friends and subordinates of the Pandyas till the Musalman invasion of<br />Madura under Malik Kafur. When the Pandya king was taken prisoner <br />and carried away by the Muhammadans(*******), the Vanada-Rayars took <br />service under the Vijayanagara kings and ruled over the- Madura <br />country. They were Vaishnavas in religion, and they gave donations, <br />as<br />may be seen from their inscriptions, to the Vishnu temples at <br />Alagarkoyil, Tiruppullani and Srlvilliputtur. Visvanatha-nayaka had <br />evidently ousted the Vanada-Hayars from Madura and<br />made it the capital of a kingdom which he formed from the districts <br />of Madura and Tinnevelly and portions of the Travancore State.<br /><br /><br />(********) ...pandya king taken prisoner??<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />   wrote: <br />  <br />  In our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Group also <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology">IIT</acronym> Profsr Rangarajan wrote on Banas several <br />  interesting details..<br />  <br />  He also initiated <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Audio version.<br />  <br />  sps<br />  ==============<br />  <br />    when i was searching for the prev thread of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> marrying <br />kundavai+ <br />    <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> daughter in agathiyar - chanced on this interesting <br />    thread ...again from the great man .. Prof JB<br />    <br />    We have the Banas, who originated in Persia. In a few centuries,<br />     they were in Andhra, later with the Pallavas of Kanchi.<br />     They changed their names and became Vaanar,<br />     Vaanaadhiraayar,<br />     Vaana Kovaraiyar etc. They came occupy very high positions<br />     later on. The supreme commander of RajaRaja Chola was<br />     Vaana Kovaraiyan Vandhiyath thevan. Strikes a familiar chord?<br />     Yes, of course. You would have met him in "Ponniyin Selvan".<br />     After the downfall of the Cholas, they joined the<br />     Paandiyas.<br />     In due course they became so powerful, that they<br />     chased away the weaker Paandiyas from Madurai. They later<br />     became absorbed into the Marava community and got assimilated<br />     into that martial class.<br />     This sort of a phenomenon is known as the "Dynastic<br />     Drift".<br />     But this does not mean that all Tamils started off<br />     from the<br />     Sarasvati Basin and migrated towards South India.<br />     Its a comfortable idea, though. The Dravidian migration<br />     from the Indus Valley. Hmmmm..... More conventional.

This area was ravaged and occupied during the invasion <br />of <br />    Krishna III Rastrakuda in early tenth &#40;c 920 &#41;century.However <br />    Kannara Deva a son of Aditya I through a rastrakuda princess <br />  &#40;Marata&#41;<br />    was refusrd his rightful throne by his father in preference to <br />    tamil Prince namely, Parandaka I . So to reserve his position, <br />a <br />    war was fought with Chola Kingdom by the Rastrakuda Krishana II <br />  but <br />    failed disatrously.

He drifted on to the south and appears eventually<br />  to have joined the Pandyas, who were thea growing in power and <br />were <br />  soon to subvert the Chola supremacy during the reign of Rajaraja <br />III <br />  and his son Rajendra-Chola III. The Vanada-Rayars continued to be <br />  friends and subordinates of the Pandyas till the Musalman invasion <br />of<br />  Madura under Malik Kafur. When the Pandya king was taken prisoner <br />  and carried away by the Muhammadans&#40;*******&#41;, the Vanada-Rayars <br />took <br />  service under the Vijayanagara kings and ruled over the- Madura <br />  country. They were Vaishnavas in religion, and they gave <br />donations, <br />  as<br />  may be seen from their inscriptions, to the Vishnu temples at <br />  Alagarkoyil, Tiruppullani and Srlvilliputtur. Visvanatha-nayaka <br />had <br />  evidently ousted the Vanada-Hayars from Madura and<br />  made it the capital of a kingdom which he formed from the <br />districts <br />  of Madura and Tinnevelly and portions of the Travancore State.<br />  <br />  <br />  &#40;********&#41; ...pandya king taken prisoner??</div></blockquote></div>

The winning<br />     country goes bank-rupt after a few years.<br />     Spain is a very fine example. The Mexican<br />  silver and the<br />     Incan and Aztec gold, apart from the other rich<br />  products should<br />     have made Spain into a very rich country. It<br />  reached its pinnacle<br />     of power and success during the rule of Charles V.<br />  But it was<br />     during his time that Spain went bankrupt.<br />     The other example is Thuglaq&#39;s Delhi.<br />  <br />  =========================================================<br />  <br />  Manivannan writes: <br />  <br />    The Spanish case is a special, or not so<br />  special,<br />   case of economic history. The looted gold was NOT<br />  invested<br />   in productive, i.e., value-adding, real assets. The net<br />   result was that the excessive inflow of gold caused<br />   excessive inflation and ruined people. Thuglaq&#39;s<br />  case is<br />   very similar. Contrast with babar and Akbar and<br />  Shajahan,<br />   who use the wawealth they obtained and/or inherited in<br />   productive, employment cresating activities, an old<br />  form of<br />   Keynisian economics.<br />  <br />  ==============================================================<br />  <br />  JayBee follows up: <br />  True.<br />  Tamilnadu was immensely rich for a long time.<br />  Marco Polo<br />  says that it was the richest kingdom in the world<br />  &#40;around 1270&#41;.<br />  Frequent wars and conquest resulted in abundant booty<br />  which<br />  suddenly filled the treasury and the all the<br />  soldier&#39;s purses,<br />  thus pouring out into the general public.<br />  Malik Kafur claims to have taken 96000 maunds<br />  &#40;ÃÂ½Ã­ÃŒ;<br />  1 ÃÂ½Ã­ÃŒ = 14 Ã€Ã—Ã±ÃŽ&#41; of gold, precious stones, etc., from<br />  Tamilnadu, laden on the backs of 360 elephants, as<br />  war booty.<br />  This is according to his own historians.<br />  The fact is, all these riches belonged to<br />  Tamilnadu.<br />  And more. Because the Malik did not go into the<br />  ChOlzha and<br />  ChEra territory proper.<br />  We can surmise that these riches were<br />  accumulated by<br />  trade, productivity, taxes, and mining. But a major<br />  part of<br />  it would have been war-booty. And we must keep in<br />  mind that<br />  their frequently victorious armies were causing<br />  greater and<br />  greater influx of riches.<br />  Now, how did Tamilnadu absorb this richness?<br />  Did they suffer from inflation?<br />  How did they buffer against inflation?<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  <br />  JayBee<br />  <br />  <br />  ==============================================<br />  <br />  The Richness of Tamilnadu<br />  <br />  Strabo wries that every year, about the time of the summer <br />solstice,<br />  120 ships sail from Hormos, an Egyptian port on the Red Sea. They<br />  traversed the sea by making use of the monsoon. They reached the <br />ports<br />  of Tamilakam in forty days.<br />  The ships returned with a rich cargo which was off-loaded at and<br />  transported by camels to the Nile. From there the cargo was sent by<br />  river to Alexandria. The cargo then reached the capital&#40;Rome&#41;.<br />  The author of &#39;Periplus of Mare Erythream&#39; says: <br />  &#39;The produce of the soil like pepper, great quantities of best <br />pearl<br />  are likewise purchased here; ivory, silk in the web, spikenard from<br />  the Ganges, betel from the countries further to the east, <br />transparent<br />  stones of all kinds, diamonds, rubies and tortoise shell from the<br />  Golden Chersonese&#40;Malaya&#41; or from the island off the coast of<br />  Limurike&#40;Sumatra&#41;. This is all from the port of Muzizris on the <br />west<br />  coast.<br />  He goes on to say: <br />  There is great resort of shipping to this port for pepper and <br />betel;<br />  the merchants bring out a large quantity of spice, and their other<br />  imports are topazes, stibium, coral, fling, glass, brass, and <br />lead, a<br />  small quantity of wine as profittable as at Barugaza&#40;modern<br />  Broach-Gujerat&#41;, cinnabar, fine cloth, arsenic and wheat, not for <br />sale<br />  but for the use of the crew.<br />  <br />  This is supported by the Sanggam description of Musiri - Musiri to<br />  which the well-rigged ships of the Yavanas come, bringing gold and<br />  taking away spices-pepper&#40;kaRi&#41; in exchange.<br />  <br />  Fine muslins and jewels, especially beryls and pearls were exported<br />  from Tamilakam, for personal adornment. Drugs, spices and <br />condiments<br />  as well as costus lycium and other cosmetics fetched high prices.<br />  <br />  Even greater was the demand for pepper which sold in the days of<br />  Pliny at the price of 15 denarii&#40;gold pieces&#41; a pound. Sapphire <br />and a<br />  variety of ruby were also exported from the Pandyan kingdom. Cotton<br />  stuff is compared to the &#39;sloughs of serpents&#39; and &#39;vapour from <br />milk&#39;<br />  and are spoken off as &#39;fine textures, the thread of which could <br />not be<br />  followed even by the eye.&#39; There were thirty vairieties of silk.<br />  <br />  One of the fashionable extravagances of the Romans at the time was<br />  the consumption of huge quantities of spice at funerals. Even as <br />early<br />  as the days of Sulla &#40;13-78 BC&#41;, we hear of two hundred and ten<br />  talents&#40;1520 lbs-c.680 kg&#41; weight of spices being used at his<br />  obsequies. The climax was reached in the days of Nero.<br />  Petronius complains that fashionable ladies of Rome exposed their<br />  charms much too immodestly,, by clothing themselves in &#39;the webs of<br />  woven wind&#39;, as he called the muslins imported from South India.<br />  Pliny says that India drained the Roman Empire annually to the <br />extent<br />  of 55,000,000 sesterces, equal to 500,000 pound sterling&#40;1911&#41;,  <br />&#40;This<br />  will be about $60 million US dollars, now.&#41; sending in return goods<br />  which sold at a hundred times their value in India.<br />  He also remarks: <br />  &#39;This is the price that we pay for our luxuries and for our women.&#39;<br />  <br />  I am giving excerpts from &#39;History of Pandya Country&#39; written by<br />  Prof.S.A.Q.Hussaini. Thsi book is well-researched.<br />  It should be noted that this book was written before 1962. He has<br />  based his facts from the treasre troves found more than 40 years<br />  before his time - since the 19th century.<br />  Since then, there have beeen other discoveries.<br />  <br />  Roman Coins in Tamilnadu: <br />  &#39;The largst number of coins of the early emperors&#40;Augustus to Nero&#41;<br />  has been found in the vicinity of the South Indian beryl mines <br />which<br />  produced the best and purest quality in the world. Most of the <br />items<br />  mentioned by the Roman writers have come from Tamilakam. It is for<br />  this reason that so many Roman coins have been found in and near<br />  Coimbatore district and at Madura, the capital of the Pandya <br />kingdom.<br />  Actually in one notable finding, were 612 gold coins and 1187 <br />silver<br />  coins. Besides these, other hoards are described as:1.&#39;of gold <br />coins,<br />  a quantity amounting to five cooly-loads, 2. and of silver coins &#39;a<br />  great many in a pot&#39;, 3.&#39;about 500 in an earthern pot, 4.&#39;a find of<br />  163&#39;, 5.&#39;some thousands enough to fill five or six Madras <br />measures&#39;,<br />  6.&#39;pot full of coins.<br />  These coins were a small part of the products of 55 separate<br />  discoveries mostly of the Coimbatore and Madura districts.<br />  An analysis of all these coins available, gives us coins of all the<br />  emperors from Augustus to Alexander Severus&#40;27 BC to 235 AD&#41;, a <br />period<br />  of nearly three centuries.<br />  Then there is a gap of over a hundred years which suggests a<br />  temporary stoppage of trade between Rome and Tamilakam. This was <br />due<br />  to internal revolts and external attacks by the various tribes of <br />the<br />  Barbarian people - Huns, Vandals, Visigoths, Ostragoths, Gauls, <br />etc.<br />  When order and good government were restored in Rome, trade with<br />  Pandya country was resumed. Zeno&#39;s coins take us to the end of the<br />  Roman empire.<br />  With the help of these shining little bits, we can follow the<br />  commercial relationship between Rome and Madura, from the time of<br />  Augustus, a little before the Christian era, to the end of the <br />fifth<br />  century AD..<br />  <br />  The presence in different places of Madura, of so many Roman coins,<br />  found lying on the ground and in the sandy beds of the River <br />vaigai,<br />  which flows across the town, implies that these coins were in daily<br />  circulation and were carelessly dropped or otherwise lost by the<br />  inhabitants of the city.<br />  Obviously most of the currency used by the people was Roman in<br />  origin.Tamil inscriptions clearly state that the Roman &#39;dinarus&#39; <br />and<br />  &#39;drachma&#39; had been in use among the Tamils. Colonel Tuffnel, in his<br />  &#39;Hints to Coin Collectors in Southern India&#39;, and Robert Sewell <br />are of<br />  the opinion that there might have ben a Roman settlement at or near<br />  Madura. The little copper coins with the Roman Emperor&#39;s head on <br />them<br />  might have been minted locally or might represent a special issue <br />for<br />  use in a country like Tamilakam where things were cheap.<br />  <br />  The Imperial Cholzhas ruled the whole of Tamilzhagam for almost <br />three<br />  centuries. But at the beginning of the 13th century, the Pandyas<br />  struck back. Maravarman Sundara Pandya ravaged the Cholzha kingdom.<br />  But still the Cholzhas held back.<br />  Several decades later, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya invaded, ravaged,<br />  destroyed, and plundered the Cholzha land.<br />  He conquerd an immense amount of booty which had been hoarded up by<br />  the Imperial Cholzhas for a span of two and a half centuries.<br />  But Sundara Pandya did not take all the booty back to Pandya nadu.<br />  Instead he made very huge donations to the temples of Cholzha nadu <br />and<br />  repaired, beautified, and made additions to a lot of Cholzhian <br />temples.<br />  Perhaps he wanted to win over the hearts of the Cholzhiya people <br />and<br />  put them at ease. The greatest benefaction was received by the<br />  SriRangam temple. The next big benefactor was the Chidhambaram <br />temple.<br />  Perhaps again, Sundara Pandya may have wanted the SriVaishnavaites <br />to<br />  feel at ease and give him, a foreigner and a stauch Saivite who <br />had no<br />  love lost for the Cholzhiyans, full support.<br />  The nature of these gifts was the &#39;Thulabara Dhanam&#39;.<br />  In the case of the SriRangam temple, the donation was done on the<br />  banks of the river.<br />  Let me quote from the works of Dr.Krishnaswamy Aiyengar: <br />  <br />  &#39;But what is of interest here is that these and various other <br />things<br />  such as cars, gold and jewel fittings for the cars, jewels of <br />various<br />  kinds for the God and Goddess, all these amounted to eighteen lakhs<br />&#40;1<br />  million 8 hundred thousand&#41; of pieces of gold of the current coin <br />in<br />  circulation.<br />  This vast amount was set apart for these various purposes by a<br />  peculiar kind of Thulabara&#40;weighment against gold&#41;.<br />  He got two boats constructed of the same size and weight, and had<br />  them afloat in the bathing ghat that goes by the name &#39;Makha&#39;&#40;the<br />  asterism in the full moon of February-March of each year under <br />which a<br />  festival takes place&#41;.<br />  On one of the boats, he placed the Royal elephant of seven cubits <br />of<br />  the carpenter&#39;s yard, high; and himself mounted on it in full <br />panoply<br />  of war with all his war-like accoutrement. And on the other boat, <br />he<br />  put an equal weight of gold and pearls, and gems of all sorts so <br />mixed<br />  as to make the boat sink to the same depth as the other.<br />  Then he made it over to the temple for these miscellaneous items of<br />  expenditure.<br />  He also received the honorific titles of &#39;Pon VEyndha PerumaL&#39; and<br />  HEmaachadhana Raja&#39;, &#39;The Great One Who Covered the Roof with <br />Gold&#39;.<br />  <br />  -----------------<br />  <br />  Marco Polo on the richness of Pandya country: <br />  <br />  When you leave the island of Seilan&#40;Ceylon&#41;, and sail<br />  westward about 60 milaes, you come to the great province of Maabar<br />  which is styled &#39;India the Greater&#39;, it is best of all the indies <br />and<br />  is on the main land. You must know that in this province are five<br />  kings, who are own brothers. I will tell you about each of them in<br />  turn. The provnce is the finest and noblst in th<br />  At this end of the province reigns one of<br />  those five Royal Brothers, who is crowned king, and his name is <br />SONDER<br />  BANDI DAVAR  In his kingdom they find very fine and great pearls.<br />  <br />  It is a fact that this king goes as bare as the<br />  rest, only around his loins he has a piece of fine cloth, and round<br />  his neck he has a necklace entirely of precious stones - rubies,<br />  sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch that this collar is of<br />  great value. He wears also hanging in front of his chest, from the<br />  ncek downwards, a fine silk thread strung with 104 large pearls and<br />  rubies of gre<br />  <br />  The King aforesaid also wears on his arms,<br />  three golden bracelets, thickly set with pearls of great value, and<br />  anklets also of the kind that he wears on his legs, and rings on <br />his<br />  toes likewis<br />  So let me tell you what this King wears between<br />  gold, gems, and pearls, is worth more than a city&#39;s ranso<br />  <br />  And &#39;tis no wonder; for he hath great store of<br />  such gear. And besides they are found in his kingdom. Moreover <br />nobody<br />  is permitted to take out of the kingdom, a pearl weighing more than<br />  half a saggio, unless he manages to do it secretly. This order is<br />  given because the king desires to reserve all such to<br />  <br />  And so in fact, the quantity he has is something<br />  almost incredible.<br />  <br />  Cail is a noble city and belongs to Ashar, the<br />  eldest of the five brother Kings. It is at this city that all the<br />  ships touch that come from the west, as from Hormos and from Kis <br />and<br />  from Aden and all Arabia, laden with horses and with other things <br />for<br />  sale. And this brings a great concourse of people from the country<br />  round about, and so there is great business done in this cit<br />  <br />  The king possesses vast treasures, and weras<br />  upon his person great store of rich jewels. He maintains great <br />state<br />  and and administers his kingdom with great equity, and extends <br />great<br />  favour to merchants and foreigners, so that they are glad to visit <br />his<br />  <br />  When the king dies, none of his childeren dares<br />  to touch his treasure. For they say, As our father did gather <br />together<br />  all this treasure, so we ought to accumulate as much in our turn. <br />And<br />  in this way, it comes to pass that there is an immensity of <br />treasure<br />  accumulated in this king.<br />  <br />  Wassaf says: <br />  <br />  Ma&#39;bar extends in length from Kulam&#40;Quilon&#41; to Nilawar&#40;Nellore&#41;,<br />  nearly three hundred parasangs along the sea coast. And in that<br />  country the king is called Dewar, which signifies the Lord of <br />Empire.<br />  <br />  The curiosities of Chin and machin, and the beautiful products of <br />Hind<br />  and Sind, laden on large ships&#40;which they call junks&#41; sailing like<br />  mountains with wings of the winds on the surface of the water, <br />always<br />  arriving<br />  <br />  The wealth of the isles of the Persian Gulf in<br />  particular, and in part the beauty and adornment of other <br />countries,<br />  from &#39;Irak and Khurasan as far as Rum and Europe, are derived from<br />  Ma&#39;bar, which is so situated as to be the key of Hin<br />  <br />  In the months of the year 692 H, the above<br />  mentioned Dewar, the ruler of Ma&#39;bar, died, and left behind him <br />much<br />  wealth and treasure. It is related by Malik-ul-Islam Jamul-ud din,<br />  that out of that treasure 7000 oxen, laden with precious stones, <br />and<br />  pure gold and silver, fell to the share of the brother who <br />succeeded.<br />  <br />  ----------------------<br />  <br />  Pandya&#39;s Horse Trade with the Arabs:Marco Polo-<br />  <br />  Here are no horses bred. And thus a great part of the wealth of the<br />  country is is wasted in purchasing horses.<br />  I will tell you how. You must know the merchants of KIS and HORMEZ,<br />  DOFAR and SODEN and ADEN collect great number os destriers and <br />other<br />  horses, and these they bring to the territories of this king and <br />his<br />  four brothers, who are kings likewise as I told you. For a horse <br />will<br />  fetch among them 500 saggi of gold worth more than 100 marks of<br />  silver. And vast numbers are sold every year.<br />  Indeed this king wants to buy more than 2000 horses every year, <br />and so<br />  do his four brothers who are kings likewise. The reason why they <br />want<br />  so many horses every year is that by the end of the year there <br />shall<br />  not be 100 of them remaining, for they all die off. And this arises<br />  from mismanagement, for those people do not know in the least how <br />to<br />  treat a horse; and besides they have no farriers. The horse <br />merchants<br />  not only never bring farriers with them, but they also prevent any<br />  farrier from going thither, lest they should in any degree baulk <br />the<br />  sale of the horese, which brings them in ever year vast gains. They<br />  bring these horses by sea aboard ships.<br />  <br />  =============================<br />  <br />  Pandyan Horse Trade with Arabs - Wassaf<br />  <br />  It was a matter of agreement that Maliku-l Islam Jamalu-d din and <br />the<br />  merchants sholud embark every year from the island of Kais, and <br />land<br />  at Ma&#39;bar, 1400 horses of his own breed, and of such generous <br />origin<br />  that, in comparison with them the most celebrated horses of <br />antiquity,<br />  such as the Rukhs of Rustam, etc., should be worthless as the <br />horses<br />  of the chess-board.<br />  It was also agreed that he should embark as many as he could <br />procure<br />  from all the isles of Persia, such as Katif, Lahsa, Bahrein, <br />Hurmuz,<br />  and Kulhatu.<br />  The price of each horse was fixed from as of old at 220 dinars of <br />red<br />  gold, on this condition, that if any horses should sustain any <br />injury<br />  during the voyage, or should happen to die, the value of them <br />should<br />  be paid from the royal treasury.<br />  It is related by authentic writers that in the reign of Atabak Abu<br />  Bakr, 10000 horses were annually exported from these places to <br />Ma&#39;bar,<br />  Kambayat, and other other ports in their neighbourhood, and the sum<br />  total of their value amounted to 2,200,000 dinars, which was paid <br />out<br />  of the overflowing revenues of the estates and endowments <br />belonging to<br />  the Hindu temples and no charge was incurred.<br />  <br />  Marco Polo says: <br />  <br />  And another strange thing to be told is that<br />  there is no possibility of breeding horses in this country. For <br />even<br />  when a great blood-mare here has been covered by a great blood <br />horse,<br />  the produce is nothing but a wretched wry-legged weed, not fit to <br />ride.<br />  <br />  Wassaf says: <br />  <br />  In a short time, the most strong, swift, fresh, and<br />  active horses become weak, slow, useless, and stupid. In short they<br />  all become wretched and good for nothing. In this climate, these<br />  powerful horses which fly swiftly without a whip&#40;for whips are<br />  required for horses, especially if they are to go to any <br />distances&#41;,<br />  should they happen to cover, become exceedingly weak and altogether<br />  worn out and unfit for riding. There is therefore, a constant<br />  necessity of getting new horses annually, and, consequently, the<br />  merchants of Muhammadan countries bring them to Ma&#39;bar.<br />  <br />  ====================================<br />  <br />  Here is a discussion that took place on the same subject in the<br />  ForumHub: <br />  ChandraSekharan Periannan and Manivannan also participated.<br />  <br />  <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-222.tm.net.my&#41; on: Thu May 6<br />  11:33:57<br />  <br />  I think its more suitable to deal with your queries in<br />  the chronological sequence.<br />  <br />  Which takes us back to the times of the Imperial<br />  Pandyas. The Cholzhas were finished off by the late 13th century; <br />the<br />  Pandyas took control of Tamilnadu. In the north, was the large<br />  sultanate of Delhi. South of the Vindyas, there were four small<br />  empires. The Yadavas Devagiri ruling over Maratha territory;<br />  Kaakaththiiyas of Telengaana/Northern Andra; HoysaaLa of Karnataka;<br />  and The Pandyas of Tamilnadu.<br />  <br />  The last of the Grand Pandyas, Maravarman Kulasekara was ruling. As<br />  was the prevalent custom at that time, the Pandyan territory was <br />ruled<br />  by five Pandyas who happened to be brothers or uncles The main <br />Pandya<br />  ruled at Madurai.<br />  <br />  The northern capital was at Jayangonda Cholapuram , 6<br />  miles from Gangaikonda Cholapuram, somewhere near Kumbakonam. At <br />the<br />  time when Kulasekara was ruling, Marco Polo who visited the Pandya<br />  country, described it as the richest country in the world.<br />  <br />  Wasaf, the Arab historian, says the the Emperor had accumulated <br />1000<br />  crores of gold in the capital city of Madurai. This was in <br />addition to<br />  the great storage of pearls, and other jems. We have to digress a <br /><acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>,<br />  to see the Muslim connection. For a very very long time, Tamilnadu <br />had<br />  colonies of Romans, Jews, Arabs, etc.<br />  <br />  Large settlements of Arabs were found in coastal towns. They had<br />  intermarried with Tamils who had converted, but pure Arabs were <br />always<br />  there in large numbers. The Arabs were very very rich and very<br />  influential. The most important Arab colony was known as <br />Vajranaadu.<br />  This was the land around Ramanathapuram. The main metropolis was<br />  Kiilzhakkarai which was called Pauththiramaanikka Pattinam; it was<br />  known as Ma&#39;abar and Fatan also. The local Arabs named it as<br />  Vahudhaapuri-named after Baghdad.<br />  <br />  A royal prince from Medina and a few islands of the Gulf was the<br />  chief of that area. He was Takiyuddin Abdur Rahman. He had a very<br />  large commercial network.<br />  <br />  Among many of his business ventures, one noteworthy programme was a<br />  contract made with the Pandyan Emperor. Takiyuddin undertook to <br />bring<br />  10000 horses every year to the Pandya country; the cost was 220 <br />gold<br />  pieces per horse. The import was at the risk of the Emperor.<br />  <br />  That contract alone brought Takiyuddin 2.2 million gold coins every<br />  year. As chief of the Arabs, he was known as the Maliki Azam<br />  Marzabanil Hindii. "Hind" was the name that the Arabs called India.<br />  <br />  In addition, he was one of the ministers of the Empire. There is a<br />  local ballad which says that Takiyuddin married a Pandyan princess <br />and<br />  became the sixth Pandyan in addition to the other five. Kulasekara <br />in<br />  one of his wars, sent an invasion to Ceylon. His commander, Arya<br />  Chakravarthi looted Ceylon and captured the Holy Tooth Relic of<br />  Buddha. The Singhalese king had to come bare-footed to Madurai and<br />  fall at the feet of Kulasekara with tribute and got back the Tooth<br />  relic. This was the highest peak of the glory the Pandyas. After <br />that,<br />  the Pandyas declined in power.<br />  <br />  JayBee<br />  <br />  ---------------------------------------------<br />  <br />  From: Chandra &#40;@ viking2.delta-air.com&#41; on: Thu May 6<br />  14:37:03<br />  <br />  <br />  JayBee, very interesting. I also read recently in the<br />  prototype of the the heirloom quality edition of Tamil Heritage<br />  handbook-cum-Thirukkural by the International tamil language<br />  foundation a quote of Marco Polo that said, "1200 crores of gold <br />coins<br />  and vast quanitities of gems and pearls".<br />  <br />  If one calculates to compare the current budget of TN, the gold<br />  deposit alone amounts to almost 1200 years&#39; worth budget assuming 1<br />  gold coin = 1 pavun &#40;8 gm&#41; as was the case since the Gupta period <br />even<br />  though some Chola coins were 1/2 pavun and and 4000 Rs/pavun the<br />  annual TN budget is about Rs. 4000 crores;&#40; I know it was about<br />  Rs.1000 crores 15 years ago&#41;.<br />  <br />  Unbelievable wealth! No doubt invaders lined up to plunder India!<br />  <br />  Also no wonder that Tamil emperors like karikAl vaLavan gave 16 <br />lakh<br />  gold coins to great pulavars such as katiyalUr <br />uruththirangkaNNanaR as<br />  reward for their poetry! I wonder how much KarikAl vaLavan must <br />have<br />  had...he had 11 mantapams one of which was made of pearls awarded <br />by a<br />  king from an island nation. Of course, one chEran gave 40 lakhs <br />gold<br />  coins to a pulavar whose poem is in the pathiRRUppaththu!<br />  <br />  As for the horse trade, the Pandiyans never learnt from earlier<br />  debacles: mANikkavAcakar etc. Of course with 1200 crores gold <br />coins,<br />  he would never be bankrupted...but 2.2 million gold coins per year <br />is<br />  2.2/12000 = 1/5450 of the wealth not bad for defence budget...I <br />think<br />  advannced countries spend a few percent per year of GDP but *not*<br />  total wealth on defence...India spends much more on defence.<br />  Interesting to compare with the present day to get a better <br />perspective.<br />  <br />  -----------------------------<br />  <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-26.tm.net.my&#41; on: Thu May 6<br />  20:01:43<br />  <br />  Yes Chandra.<br />  The riches were accumulated wealth for a period of<br />  more than 2000 years, i.e., 1000B.C-1300A.D.<br />  <br />  The Romans and others were having immense trade with Tamilzhakam.<br />  Apart from the wine, weaponary, and women, and mercenaries, the <br />Tamils<br />  got from the Romans, the Roman Aureus, the Roman gold. 12 million<br />  sesterces of gold was paid annually to India.<br />  <br />  One of the articles that the Romans wanted was pepper. Gold was<br />  cheap in Rome. They stole it elsewhere. Sometimes pepper was paid <br />its<br />  weight in gold.<br />  <br />  The drainage of Roman gold worried the Romans so much t hat Pliny<br />  lamented about it and the Roman Senate moved an embargo on trade <br />with<br />  the Tamils. The drainage was so bad that in later times the Roman <br />gold<br />  coins became debased with copper. But on the other hand, there was <br />so<br />  much Roman gold coins in Tamilnaadu that, we were using the Drachma<br />  and Dinar well until the 13th century. The Drachma was known as<br />  "thiraamam" and the Dinar as "thinaaram".<br />  <br />  We were also getting gold from north.<br />  <br />  There was also goldfrom Siberia. It found its way into India <br />through<br />  the "Silk Route". It reached south via the "Dakshina paadha"-the<br />  Southern Grand Trunk Road". Due to rupture caused by the Huns, Yueh<br />  Chi,and others, this gold trickled down.<br />  So the Tamils tured East. We developed South East Asia and ther was<br />  plenty of gold there.<br />  <br />  So Malaya earned the name Suvarna Diipa, and Sumatra became the<br />  Suvarna Bumi.<br />  <br />  All along the 2500 years, the Tamils were never conquered and so<br />  nobody looted. But we looted others, on and off, now and then. Then<br />  there was also the locally mined gold. That was how so much gold <br />was<br />  acumulated.<br />  <br />  How did the Tamils prevent inflation, when there is so much influx <br />of<br />  gold? I&#39;ll come to that later.<br />  <br />  JayBee<br />  <br />  ---------------------<br />  From: Chandra &#40;@ user-37kbbgk.dialup.mindspring.com&#41; on: <br />  Thu May 6 23:59:59<br />  <br />  As I had commented before in the vvv thread, if there<br />  was that much wealth, it becomes believable that women would throw<br />  their golden ear rings and pearl necklaces in their tiffs with <br />their<br />  husband... I would also say that the current budget for TN would <br />have<br />  to be smaller if there were no corruption. In those days, with no<br />  corruption, there must have been enormous amount of wealth <br />distributed<br />  among the people just as it is with the western countries these <br />days.<br />  <br />  ----------------------------------<br />  <br />  From: Manivannan &#40;@ sji-ca9-114.ix.netcom.com&#41; on: <br />  Fri May 7 04:01:13<br />  <br />  One of the interesting things about Cilapathikaram is<br />  that kOvalan and kaNNaki set out to start their new life in Madurai<br />  with nothing but a pair of cilampukaL. Even with mANikka paralkaL, <br />I<br />  wondered how much were they really worth. It turns out that in <br />Pandian<br />  Capital, the only jeweller considered rich enough to afford <br />kaNNaki&#39;s<br />  anklets is the jeweler to the King! Moreover, even he considers it <br />to<br />  be of such high quality that he steals it and replaces it for the<br />  Queen&#39;s anklets! One wonders how wealthy the kOvalan-kaNNaki family<br />  must have been to afford such an expensive jewel. And then in the<br />  court room scene, kaNNaki proudly declares her to be the<br />  daughter-in-law of mAcAthuvAn, the great merchant of the city of<br />  pUmpukAr. It appears that the merchants were wealthy enough to <br />rival<br />  the royals, some times acting as the bankers to the royalty - much<br />  like the European merchants of the colonial era.<br />  <br />  However, I doubt if the wealth distribution was fair.<br />  <br />  -maNivaNNan<br />  <br />  ------------------------<br />  <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-152.tm.net.my&#41; on: Fri May 7<br />  06:08:48<br />  <br />  But as you suggested, the Tamilian prosperity etc.,<br />  can be<br />  dealt with in the culture thread or we can open new threads. You <br />can<br />  study the changes that have taken place in Tamilian personality.<br />  People tend to think that the Tamils were very superstitious and <br />too<br />  orientated towards rituals and astrology in the ancient times. But<br />  history shows a different picture. They were more action orientated<br />  than us. Even after the sack of Tamilakam, you see it being very<br />  prosperous in less than two hundred years time to rank as one of<br />  world&#39;s most prosperous regions of those times.<br />  <br />  JayBee<br />  -----------------------<br />  <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-132.tm.net.my&#41; on: Fri May 7<br />  09:24:11<br />  <br />  To return to the Turkish invasion and the postmath: <br />  <br />  The beginning of the downfall: <br />  Kulasekhara Pandya had two sons. One of them, Sundara<br />  Pandya, was by<br />  the chief queen; the other, Vira Pandya, was by his favourite <br />wife. He<br />  was younger.<br />  Kulasekara chose his favourite younger son, Vira<br />  Pandya as the crown prince. The elder son, Sundara Pandya in a fit <br />of<br />  rage, murdered his father. He crowned himself as the Emperor at<br />  Madurai. Vira Pandya was centred in Chola territory. The nobles of<br />  Pandya country were angry at the murder and a big civil war <br />started.<br />  Sundara lost. So he went to Delhi. At that time, The Delhi <br />Sulatanate<br />  was ruled by the crook, Allauddin Khilji. His c-in-c, Malik Kafur <br />was<br />  already on an invasion of South India. He had subdued the Yadavas,<br />  Kaakatiiyas and the KoysaLas. While he was receiving the surrender <br />of<br />  HoysaLa, Sundara&#39;s request for help came. Khilji ordered Kafur to<br />  capture the Pandya country and make Sundara as Delhi&#39;s vassal. <br />Kafur<br />  came, saw, and destroyed. His main targets were the temples. Vira<br />  Pandya ran away. Kafur went up to Rameswaram to stop the Singhalese<br />  king from coming to help Vira Pandya. He asked the Arab-Tamils of<br />  Vajranaadu to join him in fighting against Vira Pandya in the name <br />of<br />  religion. But they told Kafur that the Koran does not preach <br />treachery<br />  and betrayal of one&#39;s king.<br />  <br />  After a while, Kafur returned back to Delhi. He took back with him<br />  96000 maunds of gold and jewels loaded on 612 elephants.<br />  <br />  A maund is equal to about 11.4 kilos.<br />  <br />  20000 horses of the once powerful Pandyan cavalry also were taken <br />away.<br />  <br />  Subsequently, Tamilnadu was invaded and raided by<br />  Khusrau Khan and Muhamed Bin Thuglaq. Both of them ravaged and <br />looted<br />  Tamilnadu, almost bone.<br />  <br />  But a few decades later, Tamilnadu came under the reign of the<br />  VijayaNagar Empire. In one of century, Tamilnadu became the main<br />  source of income, man-power and power-base for the VijayaNagar <br />Empire.<br />  Vijayanagar came to be called as the richest country in the world,<br />  by the Poruguese and other people who came here.<br />  The Nayak kingdoms which followed the break-up of VijayaNagar were<br />  also rich.<br />  However hard Tamilnadu might have fallen economically, it always<br />  bounced up with renewed vigour withinn a short space of time.<br />  Thus was the riches-generating cabacities of the Tamisl?<br />  So.....<br />  Who made Tamilnadu poor?</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>&#40;********&#41; ...pandya king taken prisoner??<br />    <br />    veera pandya was ruling in 1311 when malki came, and he escaped <br />  down south<br />  after malik left there were three claimants to the pandya throne.<br />  2 of them were already feuding&#40; veera and sundara&#41; so parakrama <br />was <br />  chosen to rule.<br />  <br />  in the next invasion of the turks 10 years later parakrama was <br />killed <br />  in the battle.<br />  <br />  the man who was taken prisoner was the warrangal raja prathapa <br />rudra.<br />  he was the first owner of the kohinoor diamond. with itr and other <br />  treasures he bought peace from malik. however in the next invasion <br />he <br />  was captured and died ont he way to delhi<br />  <br />  venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

This is all from the port of Muzizris on the<br />west<br />  coast.<br />  He goes on to say: <br />  There is great resort of shipping to this port for pepper and<br />betel;<br />  the merchants bring out a large quantity of spice, and their other<br />  imports are topazes, stibium, coral, fling, glass, brass, and<br />lead, a<br />  small quantity of wine as profittable as at Barugaza&#40;modern<br />  Broach-Gujerat&#41;, cinnabar, fine cloth, arsenic and wheat, not for<br />sale<br />  but for the use of the crew.<br /> <br />  This is supported by the Sanggam description of Musiri - Musiri to<br />  which the well-rigged ships of the Yavanas come, bringing gold and<br />  taking away spices-pepper&#40;kaRi&#41; in exchange.<br /> <br />  Fine muslins and jewels, especially beryls and pearls were exported<br />  from Tamilakam, for personal adornment. Drugs, spices and<br />condiments<br />  as well as costus lycium and other cosmetics fetched high prices.<br /> <br />  Even greater was the demand for pepper which sold in the days of<br />  Pliny at the price of 15 denarii&#40;gold pieces&#41; a pound. Sapphire<br />and a<br />  variety of ruby were also exported from the Pandyan kingdom. Cotton<br />  stuff is compared to the &#39;sloughs of serpents&#39; and &#39;vapour from<br />milk&#39;<br />  and are spoken off as &#39;fine textures, the thread of which could<br />not be<br />  followed even by the eye.&#39; There were thirty vairieties of silk.<br /> <br />  One of the fashionable extravagances of the Romans at the time was<br />  the consumption of huge quantities of spice at funerals. Even as<br />early<br />  as the days of Sulla &#40;13-78 BC&#41;, we hear of two hundred and ten<br />  talents&#40;1520 lbs-c.680 kg&#41; weight of spices being used at his<br />  obsequies. The climax was reached in the days of Nero.<br />  Petronius complains that fashionable ladies of Rome exposed their<br />  charms much too immodestly,, by clothing themselves in &#39;the webs of<br />  woven wind&#39;, as he called the muslins imported from South India.<br />  Pliny says that India drained the Roman Empire annually to the<br />extent<br />  of 55,000,000 sesterces, equal to 500,000 pound sterling&#40;1911&#41;,<br />&#40;This<br />  will be about $60 million US dollars, now.&#41; sending in return goods<br />  which sold at a hundred times their value in India.<br />  He also remarks: <br />  &#39;This is the price that we pay for our luxuries and for our women.&#39;<br /> <br />  I am giving excerpts from &#39;History of Pandya Country&#39; written by<br />  Prof.S.A.Q.Hussaini. Thsi book is well-researched.<br />  It should be noted that this book was written before 1962. He has<br />  based his facts from the treasre troves found more than 40 years<br />  before his time - since the 19th century.<br />  Since then, there have beeen other discoveries.<br /> <br />  Roman Coins in Tamilnadu: <br />  &#39;The largst number of coins of the early emperors&#40;Augustus to Nero&#41;<br />  has been found in the vicinity of the South Indian beryl mines<br />which<br />  produced the best and purest quality in the world. Most of the<br />items<br />  mentioned by the Roman writers have come from Tamilakam. It is for<br />  this reason that so many Roman coins have been found in and near<br />  Coimbatore district and at Madura, the capital of the Pandya<br />kingdom.<br />  Actually in one notable finding, were 612 gold coins and 1187<br />silver<br />  coins. Besides these, other hoards are described as:1.&#39;of gold<br />coins,<br />  a quantity amounting to five cooly-loads, 2. and of silver coins &#39;a<br />  great many in a pot&#39;, 3.&#39;about 500 in an earthern pot, 4.&#39;a find of<br />  163&#39;, 5.&#39;some thousands enough to fill five or six Madras<br />measures&#39;,<br />  6.&#39;pot full of coins.<br />  These coins were a small part of the products of 55 separate<br />  discoveries mostly of the Coimbatore and Madura districts.<br />  An analysis of all these coins available, gives us coins of all the<br />  emperors from Augustus to Alexander Severus&#40;27 BC to 235 AD&#41;, a<br />period<br />  of nearly three centuries.<br />  Then there is a gap of over a hundred years which suggests a<br />  temporary stoppage of trade between Rome and Tamilakam. This was<br />due<br />  to internal revolts and external attacks by the various tribes of<br />the<br />  Barbarian people - Huns, Vandals, Visigoths, Ostragoths, Gauls,<br />etc.<br />  When order and good government were restored in Rome, trade with<br />  Pandya country was resumed. Zeno&#39;s coins take us to the end of the<br />  Roman empire.<br />  With the help of these shining little bits, we can follow the<br />  commercial relationship between Rome and Madura, from the time of<br />  Augustus, a little before the Christian era, to the end of the<br />fifth<br />  century AD..<br /> <br />  The presence in different places of Madura, of so many Roman coins,<br />  found lying on the ground and in the sandy beds of the River<br />vaigai,<br />  which flows across the town, implies that these coins were in daily<br />  circulation and were carelessly dropped or otherwise lost by the<br />  inhabitants of the city.<br />  Obviously most of the currency used by the people was Roman in<br />  origin.Tamil inscriptions clearly state that the Roman &#39;dinarus&#39;<br />and<br />  &#39;drachma&#39; had been in use among the Tamils. Colonel Tuffnel, in his<br />  &#39;Hints to Coin Collectors in Southern India&#39;, and Robert Sewell<br />are of<br />  the opinion that there might have ben a Roman settlement at or near<br />  Madura. The little copper coins with the Roman Emperor&#39;s head on<br />them<br />  might have been minted locally or might represent a special issue<br />for<br />  use in a country like Tamilakam where things were cheap.<br /> <br />  The Imperial Cholzhas ruled the whole of Tamilzhagam for almost<br />three<br />  centuries. But at the beginning of the 13th century, the Pandyas<br />  struck back. Maravarman Sundara Pandya ravaged the Cholzha kingdom.<br />  But still the Cholzhas held back.<br />  Several decades later, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya invaded, ravaged,<br />  destroyed, and plundered the Cholzha land.<br />  He conquerd an immense amount of booty which had been hoarded up by<br />  the Imperial Cholzhas for a span of two and a half centuries.<br />  But Sundara Pandya did not take all the booty back to Pandya nadu.<br />  Instead he made very huge donations to the temples of Cholzha nadu<br />and<br />  repaired, beautified, and made additions to a lot of Cholzhian<br />temples.<br />  Perhaps he wanted to win over the hearts of the Cholzhiya people<br />and<br />  put them at ease. The greatest benefaction was received by the<br />  SriRangam temple. The next big benefactor was the Chidhambaram<br />temple.<br />  Perhaps again, Sundara Pandya may have wanted the SriVaishnavaites<br />to<br />  feel at ease and give him, a foreigner and a stauch Saivite who<br />had no<br />  love lost for the Cholzhiyans, full support.<br />  The nature of these gifts was the &#39;Thulabara Dhanam&#39;.<br />  In the case of the SriRangam temple, the donation was done on the<br />  banks of the river.<br />  Let me quote from the works of Dr.Krishnaswamy Aiyengar: <br /> <br />  &#39;But what is of interest here is that these and various other<br />things<br />  such as cars, gold and jewel fittings for the cars, jewels of<br />various<br />  kinds for the God and Goddess, all these amounted to eighteen lakhs<br />&#40;1<br />  million 8 hundred thousand&#41; of pieces of gold of the current coin<br />in<br />  circulation.<br />  This vast amount was set apart for these various purposes by a<br />  peculiar kind of Thulabara&#40;weighment against gold&#41;.<br />  He got two boats constructed of the same size and weight, and had<br />  them afloat in the bathing ghat that goes by the name &#39;Makha&#39;&#40;the<br />  asterism in the full moon of February-March of each year under<br />which a<br />  festival takes place&#41;.<br />  On one of the boats, he placed the Royal elephant of seven cubits<br />of<br />  the carpenter&#39;s yard, high; and himself mounted on it in full<br />panoply<br />  of war with all his war-like accoutrement. And on the other boat,<br />he<br />  put an equal weight of gold and pearls, and gems of all sorts so<br />mixed<br />  as to make the boat sink to the same depth as the other.<br />  Then he made it over to the temple for these miscellaneous items of<br />  expenditure.<br />  He also received the honorific titles of &#39;Pon VEyndha PerumaL&#39; and<br />  HEmaachadhana Raja&#39;, &#39;The Great One Who Covered the Roof with<br />Gold&#39;.<br /> <br />  -----------------<br /> <br />  Marco Polo on the richness of Pandya country: <br /> <br />  When you leave the island of Seilan&#40;Ceylon&#41;, and sail<br />  westward about 60 milaes, you come to the great province of Maabar<br />  which is styled &#39;India the Greater&#39;, it is best of all the indies<br />and<br />  is on the main land. You must know that in this province are five<br />  kings, who are own brothers. I will tell you about each of them in<br />  turn. The provnce is the finest and noblst in th<br />  At this end of the province reigns one of<br />  those five Royal Brothers, who is crowned king, and his name is<br />SONDER<br />  BANDI DAVAR  In his kingdom they find very fine and great pearls.<br /> <br />  It is a fact that this king goes as bare as the<br />  rest, only around his loins he has a piece of fine cloth, and round<br />  his neck he has a necklace entirely of precious stones - rubies,<br />  sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch that this collar is of<br />  great value. He wears also hanging in front of his chest, from the<br />  ncek downwards, a fine silk thread strung with 104 large pearls and<br />  rubies of gre<br /> <br />  The King aforesaid also wears on his arms,<br />  three golden bracelets, thickly set with pearls of great value, and<br />  anklets also of the kind that he wears on his legs, and rings on<br />his<br />  toes likewis<br />  So let me tell you what this King wears between<br />  gold, gems, and pearls, is worth more than a city&#39;s ranso<br /> <br />  And &#39;tis no wonder; for he hath great store of<br />  such gear. And besides they are found in his kingdom. Moreover<br />nobody<br />  is permitted to take out of the kingdom, a pearl weighing more than<br />  half a saggio, unless he manages to do it secretly. This order is<br />  given because the king desires to reserve all such to<br /> <br />  And so in fact, the quantity he has is something<br />  almost incredible.<br /> <br />  Cail is a noble city and belongs to Ashar, the<br />  eldest of the five brother Kings. It is at this city that all the<br />  ships touch that come from the west, as from Hormos and from Kis<br />and<br />  from Aden and all Arabia, laden with horses and with other things<br />for<br />  sale. And this brings a great concourse of people from the country<br />  round about, and so there is great business done in this cit<br /> <br />  The king possesses vast treasures, and weras<br />  upon his person great store of rich jewels. He maintains great<br />state<br />  and and administers his kingdom with great equity, and extends<br />great<br />  favour to merchants and foreigners, so that they are glad to visit<br />his<br /> <br />  When the king dies, none of his childeren dares<br />  to touch his treasure. For they say, As our father did gather<br />together<br />  all this treasure, so we ought to accumulate as much in our turn.<br />And<br />  in this way, it comes to pass that there is an immensity of<br />treasure<br />  accumulated in this king.<br /> <br />  Wassaf says: <br /> <br />  Ma&#39;bar extends in length from Kulam&#40;Quilon&#41; to Nilawar&#40;Nellore&#41;,<br />  nearly three hundred parasangs along the sea coast. And in that<br />  country the king is called Dewar, which signifies the Lord of<br />Empire.<br /> <br />  The curiosities of Chin and machin, and the beautiful products of<br />Hind<br />  and Sind, laden on large ships&#40;which they call junks&#41; sailing like<br />  mountains with wings of the winds on the surface of the water,<br />always<br />  arriving<br /> <br />  The wealth of the isles of the Persian Gulf in<br />  particular, and in part the beauty and adornment of other<br />countries,<br />  from &#39;Irak and Khurasan as far as Rum and Europe, are derived from<br />  Ma&#39;bar, which is so situated as to be the key of Hin<br /> <br />  In the months of the year 692 H, the above<br />  mentioned Dewar, the ruler of Ma&#39;bar, died, and left behind him<br />much<br />  wealth and treasure. It is related by Malik-ul-Islam Jamul-ud din,<br />  that out of that treasure 7000 oxen, laden with precious stones,<br />and<br />  pure gold and silver, fell to the share of the brother who<br />succeeded.<br /> <br />  ----------------------<br /> <br />  Pandya&#39;s Horse Trade with the Arabs:Marco Polo-<br /> <br />  Here are no horses bred. And thus a great part of the wealth of the<br />  country is is wasted in purchasing horses.<br />  I will tell you how. You must know the merchants of KIS and HORMEZ,<br />  DOFAR and SODEN and ADEN collect great number os destriers and<br />other<br />  horses, and these they bring to the territories of this king and<br />his<br />  four brothers, who are kings likewise as I told you. For a horse<br />will<br />  fetch among them 500 saggi of gold worth more than 100 marks of<br />  silver. And vast numbers are sold every year.<br />  Indeed this king wants to buy more than 2000 horses every year,<br />and so<br />  do his four brothers who are kings likewise. The reason why they<br />want<br />  so many horses every year is that by the end of the year there<br />shall<br />  not be 100 of them remaining, for they all die off. And this arises<br />  from mismanagement, for those people do not know in the least how<br />to<br />  treat a horse; and besides they have no farriers. The horse<br />merchants<br />  not only never bring farriers with them, but they also prevent any<br />  farrier from going thither, lest they should in any degree baulk<br />the<br />  sale of the horese, which brings them in ever year vast gains. They<br />  bring these horses by sea aboard ships.<br /> <br />  =============================<br /> <br />  Pandyan Horse Trade with Arabs - Wassaf<br /> <br />  It was a matter of agreement that Maliku-l Islam Jamalu-d din and<br />the<br />  merchants sholud embark every year from the island of Kais, and<br />land<br />  at Ma&#39;bar, 1400 horses of his own breed, and of such generous<br />origin<br />  that, in comparison with them the most celebrated horses of<br />antiquity,<br />  such as the Rukhs of Rustam, etc., should be worthless as the<br />horses<br />  of the chess-board.<br />  It was also agreed that he should embark as many as he could<br />procure<br />  from all the isles of Persia, such as Katif, Lahsa, Bahrein,<br />Hurmuz,<br />  and Kulhatu.<br />  The price of each horse was fixed from as of old at 220 dinars of<br />red<br />  gold, on this condition, that if any horses should sustain any<br />injury<br />  during the voyage, or should happen to die, the value of them<br />should<br />  be paid from the royal treasury.<br />  It is related by authentic writers that in the reign of Atabak Abu<br />  Bakr, 10000 horses were annually exported from these places to<br />Ma&#39;bar,<br />  Kambayat, and other other ports in their neighbourhood, and the sum<br />  total of their value amounted to 2,200,000 dinars, which was paid<br />out<br />  of the overflowing revenues of the estates and endowments<br />belonging to<br />  the Hindu temples and no charge was incurred.<br /> <br />  Marco Polo says: <br /> <br />  And another strange thing to be told is that<br />  there is no possibility of breeding horses in this country. For<br />even<br />  when a great blood-mare here has been covered by a great blood<br />horse,<br />  the produce is nothing but a wretched wry-legged weed, not fit to<br />ride.<br /> <br />  Wassaf says: <br /> <br />  In a short time, the most strong, swift, fresh, and<br />  active horses become weak, slow, useless, and stupid. In short they<br />  all become wretched and good for nothing. In this climate, these<br />  powerful horses which fly swiftly without a whip&#40;for whips are<br />  required for horses, especially if they are to go to any<br />distances&#41;,<br />  should they happen to cover, become exceedingly weak and altogether<br />  worn out and unfit for riding. There is therefore, a constant<br />  necessity of getting new horses annually, and, consequently, the<br />  merchants of Muhammadan countries bring them to Ma&#39;bar.<br /> <br />  ====================================<br /> <br />  Here is a discussion that took place on the same subject in the<br />  ForumHub: <br />  ChandraSekharan Periannan and Manivannan also participated.<br /> <br /> <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-222.tm.net.my&#41; on: Thu May 6<br />  11:33:57<br /> <br />  I think its more suitable to deal with your queries in<br />  the chronological sequence.<br /> <br />  Which takes us back to the times of the Imperial<br />  Pandyas. The Cholzhas were finished off by the late 13th century;<br />the<br />  Pandyas took control of Tamilnadu. In the north, was the large<br />  sultanate of Delhi. South of the Vindyas, there were four small<br />  empires. The Yadavas Devagiri ruling over Maratha territory;<br />  Kaakaththiiyas of Telengaana/Northern Andra; HoysaaLa of Karnataka;<br />  and The Pandyas of Tamilnadu.<br /> <br />  The last of the Grand Pandyas, Maravarman Kulasekara was ruling. As<br />  was the prevalent custom at that time, the Pandyan territory was<br />ruled<br />  by five Pandyas who happened to be brothers or uncles The main<br />Pandya<br />  ruled at Madurai.<br /> <br />  The northern capital was at Jayangonda Cholapuram , 6<br />  miles from Gangaikonda Cholapuram, somewhere near Kumbakonam. At<br />the<br />  time when Kulasekara was ruling, Marco Polo who visited the Pandya<br />  country, described it as the richest country in the world.<br /> <br />  Wasaf, the Arab historian, says the the Emperor had accumulated<br />1000<br />  crores of gold in the capital city of Madurai. This was in<br />addition to<br />  the great storage of pearls, and other jems. We have to digress a<br /><acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>,<br />  to see the Muslim connection. For a very very long time, Tamilnadu<br />had<br />  colonies of Romans, Jews, Arabs, etc.<br /> <br />  Large settlements of Arabs were found in coastal towns. They had<br />  intermarried with Tamils who had converted, but pure Arabs were<br />always<br />  there in large numbers. The Arabs were very very rich and very<br />  influential. The most important Arab colony was known as<br />Vajranaadu.<br />  This was the land around Ramanathapuram. The main metropolis was<br />  Kiilzhakkarai which was called Pauththiramaanikka Pattinam; it was<br />  known as Ma&#39;abar and Fatan also. The local Arabs named it as<br />  Vahudhaapuri-named after Baghdad.<br /> <br />  A royal prince from Medina and a few islands of the Gulf was the<br />  chief of that area. He was Takiyuddin Abdur Rahman. He had a very<br />  large commercial network.<br /> <br />  Among many of his business ventures, one noteworthy programme was a<br />  contract made with the Pandyan Emperor. Takiyuddin undertook to<br />bring<br />  10000 horses every year to the Pandya country; the cost was 220<br />gold<br />  pieces per horse. The import was at the risk of the Emperor.<br /> <br />  That contract alone brought Takiyuddin 2.2 million gold coins every<br />  year. As chief of the Arabs, he was known as the Maliki Azam<br />  Marzabanil Hindii. "Hind" was the name that the Arabs called India.<br /> <br />  In addition, he was one of the ministers of the Empire. There is a<br />  local ballad which says that Takiyuddin married a Pandyan princess<br />and<br />  became the sixth Pandyan in addition to the other five. Kulasekara<br />in<br />  one of his wars, sent an invasion to Ceylon. His commander, Arya<br />  Chakravarthi looted Ceylon and captured the Holy Tooth Relic of<br />  Buddha. The Singhalese king had to come bare-footed to Madurai and<br />  fall at the feet of Kulasekara with tribute and got back the Tooth<br />  relic. This was the highest peak of the glory the Pandyas. After<br />that,<br />  the Pandyas declined in power.<br /> <br />  JayBee<br /> <br />  ---------------------------------------------<br /> <br />  From: Chandra &#40;@ viking2.delta-air.com&#41; on: Thu May 6<br />  14:37:03<br /> <br /> <br />  JayBee, very interesting. I also read recently in the<br />  prototype of the the heirloom quality edition of Tamil Heritage<br />  handbook-cum-Thirukkural by the International tamil language<br />  foundation a quote of Marco Polo that said, "1200 crores of gold<br />coins<br />  and vast quanitities of gems and pearls".<br /> <br />  If one calculates to compare the current budget of TN, the gold<br />  deposit alone amounts to almost 1200 years&#39; worth budget assuming 1<br />  gold coin = 1 pavun &#40;8 gm&#41; as was the case since the Gupta period<br />even<br />  though some Chola coins were 1/2 pavun and and 4000 Rs/pavun the<br />  annual TN budget is about Rs. 4000 crores;&#40; I know it was about<br />  Rs.1000 crores 15 years ago&#41;.<br /> <br />  Unbelievable wealth! No doubt invaders lined up to plunder India!<br /> <br />  Also no wonder that Tamil emperors like karikAl vaLavan gave 16<br />lakh<br />  gold coins to great pulavars such as katiyalUr<br />uruththirangkaNNanaR as<br />  reward for their poetry! I wonder how much KarikAl vaLavan must<br />have<br />  had...he had 11 mantapams one of which was made of pearls awarded<br />by a<br />  king from an island nation. Of course, one chEran gave 40 lakhs<br />gold<br />  coins to a pulavar whose poem is in the pathiRRUppaththu!<br /> <br />  As for the horse trade, the Pandiyans never learnt from earlier<br />  debacles: mANikkavAcakar etc. Of course with 1200 crores gold<br />coins,<br />  he would never be bankrupted...but 2.2 million gold coins per year<br />is<br />  2.2/12000 = 1/5450 of the wealth not bad for defence budget...I<br />think<br />  advannced countries spend a few percent per year of GDP but *not*<br />  total wealth on defence...India spends much more on defence.<br />  Interesting to compare with the present day to get a better<br />perspective.<br /> <br />  -----------------------------<br /> <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-26.tm.net.my&#41; on: Thu May 6<br />  20:01:43<br /> <br />  Yes Chandra.<br />  The riches were accumulated wealth for a period of<br />  more than 2000 years, i.e., 1000B.C-1300A.D.<br /> <br />  The Romans and others were having immense trade with Tamilzhakam.<br />  Apart from the wine, weaponary, and women, and mercenaries, the<br />Tamils<br />  got from the Romans, the Roman Aureus, the Roman gold. 12 million<br />  sesterces of gold was paid annually to India.<br /> <br />  One of the articles that the Romans wanted was pepper. Gold was<br />  cheap in Rome. They stole it elsewhere. Sometimes pepper was paid<br />its<br />  weight in gold.<br /> <br />  The drainage of Roman gold worried the Romans so much t hat Pliny<br />  lamented about it and the Roman Senate moved an embargo on trade<br />with<br />  the Tamils. The drainage was so bad that in later times the Roman<br />gold<br />  coins became debased with copper. But on the other hand, there was<br />so<br />  much Roman gold coins in Tamilnaadu that, we were using the Drachma<br />  and Dinar well until the 13th century. The Drachma was known as<br />  "thiraamam" and the Dinar as "thinaaram".<br /> <br />  We were also getting gold from north.<br /> <br />  There was also goldfrom Siberia. It found its way into India<br />through<br />  the "Silk Route". It reached south via the "Dakshina paadha"-the<br />  Southern Grand Trunk Road". Due to rupture caused by the Huns, Yueh<br />  Chi,and others, this gold trickled down.<br />  So the Tamils tured East. We developed South East Asia and ther was<br />  plenty of gold there.<br /> <br />  So Malaya earned the name Suvarna Diipa, and Sumatra became the<br />  Suvarna Bumi.<br /> <br />  All along the 2500 years, the Tamils were never conquered and so<br />  nobody looted. But we looted others, on and off, now and then. Then<br />  there was also the locally mined gold. That was how so much gold<br />was<br />  acumulated.<br /> <br />  How did the Tamils prevent inflation, when there is so much influx<br />of<br />  gold? I&#39;ll come to that later.<br /> <br />  JayBee<br /> <br />  ---------------------<br />  From: Chandra &#40;@ user-37kbbgk.dialup.mindspring.com&#41; on: <br />  Thu May 6 23:59:59<br /> <br />  As I had commented before in the vvv thread, if there<br />  was that much wealth, it becomes believable that women would throw<br />  their golden ear rings and pearl necklaces in their tiffs with<br />their<br />  husband... I would also say that the current budget for TN would<br />have<br />  to be smaller if there were no corruption. In those days, with no<br />  corruption, there must have been enormous amount of wealth<br />distributed<br />  among the people just as it is with the western countries these<br />days.<br /> <br />  ----------------------------------<br /> <br />  From: Manivannan &#40;@ sji-ca9-114.ix.netcom.com&#41; on: <br />  Fri May 7 04:01:13<br /> <br />  One of the interesting things about Cilapathikaram is<br />  that kOvalan and kaNNaki set out to start their new life in Madurai<br />  with nothing but a pair of cilampukaL. Even with mANikka paralkaL,<br />I<br />  wondered how much were they really worth. It turns out that in<br />Pandian<br />  Capital, the only jeweller considered rich enough to afford<br />kaNNaki&#39;s<br />  anklets is the jeweler to the King! Moreover, even he considers it<br />to<br />  be of such high quality that he steals it and replaces it for the<br />  Queen&#39;s anklets! One wonders how wealthy the kOvalan-kaNNaki family<br />  must have been to afford such an expensive jewel. And then in the<br />  court room scene, kaNNaki proudly declares her to be the<br />  daughter-in-law of mAcAthuvAn, the great merchant of the city of<br />  pUmpukAr. It appears that the merchants were wealthy enough to<br />rival<br />  the royals, some times acting as the bankers to the royalty - much<br />  like the European merchants of the colonial era.<br /> <br />  However, I doubt if the wealth distribution was fair.<br /> <br />  -maNivaNNan<br /> <br />  ------------------------<br /> <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-152.tm.net.my&#41; on: Fri May 7<br />  06:08:48<br /> <br />  But as you suggested, the Tamilian prosperity etc.,<br />  can be<br />  dealt with in the culture thread or we can open new threads. You<br />can<br />  study the changes that have taken place in Tamilian personality.<br />  People tend to think that the Tamils were very superstitious and<br />too<br />  orientated towards rituals and astrology in the ancient times. But<br />  history shows a different picture. They were more action orientated<br />  than us. Even after the sack of Tamilakam, you see it being very<br />  prosperous in less than two hundred years time to rank as one of<br />  world&#39;s most prosperous regions of those times.<br /> <br />  JayBee<br />  -----------------------<br /> <br />  From: JayBee &#40;@ sp-69-132.tm.net.my&#41; on: Fri May 7<br />  09:24:11<br /> <br />  To return to the Turkish invasion and the postmath: <br /> <br />  The beginning of the downfall: <br />  Kulasekhara Pandya had two sons. One of them, Sundara<br />  Pandya, was by<br />  the chief queen; the other, Vira Pandya, was by his favourite<br />wife. He<br />  was younger.<br />  Kulasekara chose his favourite younger son, Vira<br />  Pandya as the crown prince. The elder son, Sundara Pandya in a fit<br />of<br />  rage, murdered his father. He crowned himself as the Emperor at<br />  Madurai. Vira Pandya was centred in Chola territory. The nobles of<br />  Pandya country were angry at the murder and a big civil war<br />started.<br />  Sundara lost. So he went to Delhi. At that time, The Delhi<br />Sulatanate<br />  was ruled by the crook, Allauddin Khilji. His c-in-c, Malik Kafur<br />was<br />  already on an invasion of South India. He had subdued the Yadavas,<br />  Kaakatiiyas and the KoysaLas. While he was receiving the surrender<br />of<br />  HoysaLa, Sundara&#39;s request for help came. Khilji ordered Kafur to<br />  capture the Pandya country and make Sundara as Delhi&#39;s vassal.<br />Kafur<br />  came, saw, and destroyed. His main targets were the temples. Vira<br />  Pandya ran away. Kafur went up to Rameswaram to stop the Singhalese<br />  king from coming to help Vira Pandya. He asked the Arab-Tamils of<br />  Vajranaadu to join him in fighting against Vira Pandya in the name<br />of<br />  religion. But they told Kafur that the Koran does not preach<br />treachery<br />  and betrayal of one&#39;s king.<br /> <br />  After a while, Kafur returned back to Delhi. He took back with him<br />  96000 maunds of gold and jewels loaded on 612 elephants.<br /> <br />  A maund is equal to about 11.4 kilos.<br /> <br />  20000 horses of the once powerful Pandyan cavalry also were taken<br />away.<br /> <br />  Subsequently, Tamilnadu was invaded and raided by<br />  Khusrau Khan and Muhamed Bin Thuglaq. Both of them ravaged and<br />looted<br />  Tamilnadu, almost bone.<br /> <br />  But a few decades later, Tamilnadu came under the reign of the<br />  VijayaNagar Empire. In one of century, Tamilnadu became the main<br />  source of income, man-power and power-base for the VijayaNagar<br />Empire.<br />  Vijayanagar came to be called as the richest country in the world,<br />  by the Poruguese and other people who came here.<br />  The Nayak kingdoms which followed the break-up of VijayaNagar were<br />  also rich.<br />  However hard Tamilnadu might have fallen economically, it always<br />  bounced up with renewed vigour withinn a short space of time.<br />  Thus was the riches-generating cabacities of the Tamisl?<br />  So.....<br />  Who made Tamilnadu poor?<br /> <br /><br /> <br />   <br />    &#40;********&#41; ...pandya king taken prisoner??<br />   <br />    veera pandya was ruling in 1311 when malki came, and he escaped<br />  down south<br />  after malik left there were three claimants to the pandya throne.<br />  2 of them were already feuding&#40; veera and sundara&#41; so parakrama<br />was<br />  chosen to rule.<br /> <br />  in the next invasion of the turks 10 years later parakrama was<br />killed<br />  in the battle.<br /> <br />  the man who was taken prisoner was the warrangal raja prathapa<br />rudra.<br />  he was the first owner of the kohinoor diamond. with itr and other<br />  treasures he bought peace from malik. however in the next invasion<br />he<br />  was captured and died ont he way to delhi<br /> <br />  venketesh</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more.

When the Pallavas were subverted by <br />  the <br />    Cholas, they became subordinates of the Cholas, and the Vanada-<br />    Rayars continued faithful to the latter till the reign of <br />  Kulottunga <br />    III. Rajaraja Vanakovaraiyan, alias Ponparappinan Magadaipperamal,<br />    one of the vassals of Kulottunga III, rebelled against bis <br />  suzerain <br />    and entered into political compacts with some southern petty <br />    princes. He drifted on to the south and appears eventually<br />    to have joined the Pandyas, who were thea growing in power and <br />  were <br />    soon to subvert the Chola supremacy during the reign of Rajaraja <br />  III <br />    and his son Rajendra-Chola III. The Vanada-Rayars continued to be <br />    friends and subordinates of the Pandyas till the Musalman invasion <br />  of<br />    Madura under Malik Kafur. When the Pandya king was taken prisoner <br />    and carried away by the Muhammadans&#40;*******&#41;, the Vanada-Rayars <br />  took <br />    service under the Vijayanagara kings and ruled over the- Madura <br />    country. They were Vaishnavas in religion, and they gave <br />  donations, <br />    as<br />    may be seen from their inscriptions, to the Vishnu temples at <br />    Alagarkoyil, Tiruppullani and Srlvilliputtur. Visvanatha-nayaka <br />  had <br />    evidently ousted the Vanada-Hayars from Madura and<br />    made it the capital of a kingdom which he formed from the <br />  districts <br />    of Madura and Tinnevelly and portions of the Travancore State.<br />    <br />    <br />    &#40;********&#41; ...pandya king taken prisoner??</div></blockquote></div>
