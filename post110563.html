Also requested him to sing the title song.<br />rest is history.<br /><br />2. There is a belief in kollywood that if IR sings the title song, the<br />film is a silver jubilee. And the belief has been true almost 100%.<br />And the title song of Karagatakkaran has lyrics similar to this belife.<br /><br />3. Barathiraja, Balachander - doyens of kollywood - could not give a<br />hit as they gave in combination with IR, till date. All there movies<br />after parting with IR are either flop or didnt do well in the box office.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Dr Sri, SPB did not say anything derogatory on IR - Gangai Amaran was present in the program and he said that GA's talent was unique it its own way and largely overshadowed by his bigger celebrity brother. <br />Â <br />I like any song as long as it is nice to listen to,regardless of who the composer really was. For whatever reason IR's times and music have created this kind of fanaticism that others include ARR are somehow inferior just because they are not as creative as he is (which is again a very relative statement) or not classically knowledgable or whatever. The only thing I have not yet seen happen is a campaign to include IR among Sangeetha Mumoorthis of Tyagaraja, Dikshitar and Syama Sastri yet. Now once that is done we can do away with any and all debates and include him also in our pooja halls/rooms before anyone needs to sing.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br />--- On Wed, 9/24/08, sridhar rathinam  wrote: <br /><br />From: sridhar rathinam <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: ARR<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, September 24, 2008, 2:34 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Udanx<br />I like IR infact love IR...Malathi or someone said about SPB qouting Gangaiamaran wasnt given due credit the same SPB...every other minute goes on about ennoda raja ...in ennodu paatu padungal...<br />I like ARR some of them are gems or were gems when was the last time ARR had you mesmerised like Roja or Bombay....?Â Â  and rehashing the same onesin english and hindi????<br /><br />Theres one thing we have to give ARR credit he created the culture of needing lyric books to understnad what the songs really say...and ofcourse the Unit Narayan entry....<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br /><br />--- On Wed, 24/9/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: <br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Wednesday, 24 September, 2008, 6:46 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well, this may be the last mail from my sideÂ w.r.t this thread.<br /><br />I am surprised that you people discuss ARR in the same league?

			<div class="content">Udanx, ok, let us get one point clear. IR himself has admitted to be overcommitted and therefore being less creative. It is not something anyone who dislikes him has made up. He went as far to say he wished he never came to movies, a remark that irked several people since his success and popularity are due to movies.<br />Â <br />I get what you are saying and I have acknowledged that from the beginning. Creativity is his forte. But creativity is not the only thing that makes a music director great, it is one of the things but not the only thing. When I was young and learning music I wanted to learn as many ragas as possible.My music teacher used to say if you can sing one raga and sing it well youare good singer. If you can sing two ragas really well you are a great singer. If you want to sing all ragas you are less interested in depth and more in telling the world that you know all of them. It is like that. There isnothing in musical world that says you have to know X number of ragas, invent Y ragas and that is what makes you a great musician. It is not. What makes a great musician is how you use whatever you know and how much people remember your music.<br />Â <br />The raga Shankarabharanam has almost become synonymous with movie and music. Even if KVM had made just that one movie he would have enjoyed great famesince it was one movie done perfectly. If I want to identify any raga say Kurinji I only have to think of TMS humming Sundari Soundari Nirandariye...I know any other song is Kurinji. That is all good music is about.<br />Â <br />You can give IR credit for the vastness of his creativity and usage of various ragas, I don't deny that and have said so repeatedly.Â But dont' say that makes him superior or better than others in some way. It does not and it is a total misconception that knowing more makes one a better musician.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Wed, 9/24/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: ARR<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, September 24, 2008, 11:02 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I thought I will be silent but you people provoke me to write.<br /><br /><br />Creativity - Let me clarify on this first.<br />============ ========= ========= ===<br />Malathi you dont know cricket.

			<div class="content">Creativity is his forte<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When will you go for creativity? Assuming I am a novice in cooking an item<br />say 'X' I will not try on creativity our right. I will first understand what<br />is that I am cooking. Then I will follow the normal world accepted procedure<br />which my mom and grandma had been doing for ages. When I keep on repeating<br />the preparation of 'X', at one point in time I will know the process /<br />preparation procedure like the back of my hand. Only at this point I will<br />try to bring in my creativity.<br /><br /><br /><br />When I prepare rasam my mother's normal lecture is something like this<br /><br />1. I should be able to judge the amount of Tamarind required for the<br />preparation of rasam. Soak that required amount in hot water.<br />2. After sometime when its soft extract the juice of the tamarind and add<br />rasam powder and salt that will be required for the rasam.<br />3. Add Asafoetida and allow that to boil.<br />4. When the rasam powder smell is gone add dhal water to that and keep it<br />in sim<br />5. After sometime the rasam will form thick foam that's the time to add<br />finely chopped coriander leaves and switch off the burner.<br />6. Talichi kottudhal simply mustard will be done after this.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is normal preparation of Rasam and it will smell / taste very good.<br /><br /><br /><br />Creativity comes after that I have mentioned a few which I can think of<br /><br />1. Replacing stainless steel with Eeya Chombu<br />2. Have a Eeya Chombu which has Asafoetida coated at the bottom<br />3. Using an iron karandhi for Thaalichu Kottudhal<br />4. Using Ghee instead of oil<br />5. Again adding Asafoetida powder during the Thalichu Kottudhal<br /><br /><br /><br />If I don't know the process of preparing rasam and I simply try for<br />creativity alone I wont be making a good rasam.<br />(Cricket teriyaadhu / madras geography teriyaadhu-na parava illa. But Pulees<br />Samayalum teriyaadhu-nu sollidadeenga. Naan nondhu poiduvenn)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you want to sing all ragas you are less interested in depth and more in<br />telling the world that you know all of them<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So now our Malathi wants to equate herself to IR well well â€¦<br />As I mentioned above, he has done his creativity not only in a particular<br />raga but on many Ragas and also on Ragas which others dare to even do a<br />straight forward composition. My point is, he is having the in-depth<br />knowledge which you are asking for. Over and above the indepth knowledge he<br />is doing his creativity. Sample is the Xl sheet which I had sent last week.<br /><br />If I have to go <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> technical â€“ when you start singing you tune yourself to<br />Saaaa Paaaa â€¦. Saaaa Paaa.<br /><br />1. Why these two notes alone?<br />2. Why don't we tune to other notes?<br />3. What will happen if you tune yourself to other notes?<br /><br />When you travel in a normal route from Point A to Point B you will know how<br />it looks. You will know the land marks. But what will happen if you travel<br />from Point B to Point A?<br /><br /><br />I tell you try to observe this in real life as well. Walk from Point A to<br />Point B in the forward direction and again walk backwards. Repeat the<br />process by starting from Point B.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What makes a great musician is how you use whatever you know and how much<br />people remember your music<br /><br /><br /><br />As mentioned above go through the XL and also go through the BLOG. You feel<br />that it's a hero worship of IR in that blog. Fine, but there are no<br />imaginary points / dubious statistics on the ragas and his usage. Try to<br />absorb that alone. Try to find out what are the various ragas he has used.<br /><br />1. His straight forward compositions<br />2. What is the alien swara he has used<br />3. How does he change the Raga with just a replacement of swaras<br />4. How has he handled Gruha Bedam.Read all that collect only the<br />technical points</div>

			<div class="content">Udanx, let me answer shortly today, am in a hurry to work my apologies. First of all I'd like to read technical points in your friend's site (and there are several other sites too devoted more to music) - I took on the project of compiling songs/ragas and still working on it, it is huge and lack of time is an issue. So I will do what I can.<br />Â <br />I am not comparing myself to IR - although must confess I am really irritated again by your inference that the rest of the world are somehow cheapÂ lesser mortals. I gave you my teacher's quote which is a very valuable reference with regards to how much is there to learn in the oceanic field of classical music. In olden days singers used to have ragas affixed to their name like Kalyani this bagavathar, Kambodhi that bagavathar and so on - simplybecause it takes so much of practice and expertise to learn one raga with depth. <br />Â <br />Nobody is against creativity and <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym> there has been lots of creativity by older people too, just they did n't have fan clubs of people analyzing what they did. Using Mukari in a romantic duet was unheard of and GR did that with great elan in Ambikapathi. Ghantasala and KVM gave us whole movies with background music telling the story even to someone who has not seen it. It is not necessary to be innovative the IR way that is the point. It might bepertinent for you to think that after so many generations of classical music singers why so few ragas were invented? Because most of them thought it was unnecessary to invent anything even learning and using what we already have takes more than a few lifetimes. It is the same logic somewhat that goes with building new temples when we have 33000+ old temples languishing for lack of funds. <br />Â <br />Anyway am stopping here now. I will try to find time to get into technicalites later depending on time, I wish I did. The debate would be over in no time if we agree that everyone was creative in their own way and many times depth in one area is preferred over width in several. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Thu, 9/25/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: ARR<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Thursday, September 25, 2008, 3:11 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Creativity is his forte<br /><br />Â <br /><br />When will you go for creativity? Assuming I am a novice in cooking an item say 'X' I will not try on creativity our right. I will first understand what is that I am cooking. Then I will follow the normal world accepted procedure which my mom and grandma had been doing for ages. When I keep on repeating the preparation of 'X', at one point in time I will know the process / preparation procedure like the back of my hand. Only at this point I will try to bring in my creativity.<br />Â <br />When I prepare rasam my mother's normal lecture is something like this<br /><br /><br />I should be able to judge the amount of Tamarind required for the preparation of rasam. Soak that required amount in hot water.<br /><br />After sometime when its soft extract the juice of the tamarind and add rasam powder and salt that will be required for the rasam.<br /><br />Add Asafoetida and allow that to boil.<br /><br />When the rasam powder smell is gone add dhal water to that and keep it in sim<br /><br />After sometime the rasam will form thick foam that's the time to add finelychopped coriander leaves and switch off the burner.<br /><br />Talichi kottudhal simply mustard will be done after this.<br />Â <br />This is normal preparation of Rasam and it will smell / taste very good.<br />Â <br />Creativity comes after that I have mentioned a few which I can think of<br /><br /><br />Replacing stainless steel with Eeya Chombu<br /><br />Have a Eeya Chombu which has Asafoetida coated at the bottom<br /><br />Using an iron karandhi for Thaalichu Kottudhal<br /><br />Using Ghee instead of oil<br /><br />Again adding Asafoetida powder during the Thalichu Kottudhal<br />Â <br />IfÂ I don't know the process of preparing rasam and I simply try for creativity alone I wont be making a good rasam.<br />(Cricket teriyaadhu / madras geography teriyaadhu-na parava illa. But Pulees Samayalum teriyaadhu-nu sollidadeenga. Naan nondhu poiduvenn)<br /><br />Â <br /><br />If you want to sing all ragas you are less interested in depth and more in telling the world that you know all of them<br /><br />Â <br /><br />So now our Malathi wants to equate herself to IR well well â€¦ <br />As I mentioned above, he has done his creativity not only in a particular raga but on many Ragas and also on Ragas which others dare to even do a straight forward composition. My point is, he is having the in-depth knowledge which you are asking for. Over and above the indepth knowledge he is doing his creativity. Sample is the Xl sheet which I had sent last week.<br />Â <br />If I have to go <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> technical â€“ when you start singing you tune yourself to Saaaa Paaaa â€¦. Saaaa Paaa. <br /><br /><br />Why these two notes alone? <br /><br />Why don't we tune to other notes? <br /><br />What will happen if you tune yourself to other notes?<br />When you travel in a normal route from Point A to Point B you will know howit looks. You will know the land marks. But what will happen if you travelfrom Point B to Point A?<br />Â <br />I tell you try to observe this in real life as well. Walk from Point A to Point B in the forward direction and again walk backwards. Repeat the process by starting from Point B.<br /><br />Â <br /><br />What makes a great musician is how you use whatever you know and how much people remember your music<br /><br />Â <br /><br />As mentioned above go through the XL and also go through the BLOG. You feelthat it's a hero worship of IR in that blog. Fine, but there are no imaginary points / dubious statistics on the ragas and his usage. Try to absorb that alone. Try to find out what are the various ragas he has used. <br /><br /><br />HisÂ straight forward compositions<br /><br />What is the alien swara he has used<br /><br />How does he change the Raga with just a replacement of swaras<br /><br />How has he handled Gruha Bedam.Read all that collect only the technical points<br /><br />Â </div>

I think its going on in rounds and looks<br />like 'aracha mavaye araikarathu'.  <br /><br />Udanx, whatever you try, you cant convince Malathi and I dont think<br />you have any need to convince her either. IR needs no certificate from<br />anyone and so is other doyens of the music world. <br /><br />Malathi, I request you to be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> polite (at times you go beyond<br />limits, sorry to be harsh but I feel so.)Like saying Hero worship is<br />done by uneducated people - is unwarranted. This is not hero<br />worship..doing paal abishekam or setting oneself on fire for the sake<br />of their hero is blind hero worship and i dont think Udanx will do<br />either of these for IR's sake. (Udanx...panna mattenga illa..ungala<br />nambi naan commit panniten <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<br /><br />Lets put an end to this as neither of you are trying to understand the<br />other. Sorry if I have gone overboard.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>
