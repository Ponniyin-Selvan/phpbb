Am<br />      not sure if that is the goal of every woman &#40;definitely not <br />  mine&#41;. I have<br />      heard several women say that even in the States, that since <br />  climbing the<br />      corporate ladder means being a &#39;man&#39; atleast technically they <br />  don&#39;t consider<br />      that progress.

They<br />      have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the <br />  powerful and<br />      autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh <br />  hasina,<br />      Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a coterie <br />  group like<br />      Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up <br />people <br />  who are<br />      actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.<br />     <br />      I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but not<br />      authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many <br />  times, there<br />      might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a <br />little<br />      determination and setting up of priorities can get them to <br />break <br />  it.

			<div class="content">Malathi,<br />Â <br />Â  I lived inÂ R.S.Puram area too. I did my CÂ Programming from Aptech there long time back. The Aptech was near Pazhamudhir Cholai in RS puram. I started my carreer there as a data entry operator (the famous Tally software), for a Kannan Devan Tea agency also in RS.P. <br />Â <br />Â  R.S. Puram is one ofÂ myÂ favourite places there,Â next is Saibaba colony (these two are proofÂ for the richness of the city). I hope it stillstays the same even thoughÂ it is crowded and everything. Last time I wasin coimbatore was 4 yrs back.Â Had to go through lot of check posts to enter into the city. I have relatives lining from Singanallur toÂ Ganapathi to Perur.Â I can still remember the bus routesÂ and streets crystal clear.Â <br />Â <br />Â  I do see how spoilt the girls are there. Most of cousins are married and settled in coimbatore. Not just sari shopping, jewelry shoppingÂ too. Mythaatha wanted to get his daughters marriedÂ within coimbatore.Â They were very protective of their kids. Until I was 5 yrs old, we were in coimbatore and then movedÂ out. My father workedÂ for Kamala (not sure of the name - from the LMW family) mills there.Â Â <br />Â <br />Â Â  My chithappa used to write jokesÂ for AV (his name is KinathukadavuRavi). HeÂ is in R.S.Puram. My aunties in Ramanathapuram, Big Bazar Street (famous periya kadai veethi),Â cousins singanallur. I wasÂ visiting my auntÂ in Big Bazar street, coimbatore when the Pillaiyar drinkingÂ milkÂ episode happened. Part of my masters IÂ stayed in Sungam (near Nirmala College).<br />Â <br />Â Â I can write on and on, I willÂ stop here.<br />Â <br />AnandhiÂ ,___</div>

			<div class="content">Hi all,<br />Â <br />The Indian Law is one of the most complex and has all the solutions and caters to situations faced by woman in general. Except that the implementationof the law of the land is at a very pathetic level. As citizens, women should approach and get relief by the getting the law of the land into implementation mode.<br />Â <br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Malathi Mahadevan <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Sunday, 7 September, 2008 6:43:03 PM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br /><br /><br />Yes it is hard for a woman to succeed anywhere, even in an ordinary work situation without backing of a man. It is simple statistics there are more men than women and it is still a man's world. I am not sure if that is any more complex than that.<br /><br />Ravi, interesting to know that women are better strategists, sounds logicalto me since generally men are given to more direct thinking almost all thetime. Very generally that is. Am not at all sure about the marketing part,for one thing there are very few women in marketing compared to men and it would be unfair to draw any conclusion based on that.<br /><br />As far as generalising about innocence and other traits, well all people men or women are human. It is not possible to generalise like that. But on the other hand an advanced society provides certain options to people who arecaught in bad/troublesome situations. Unfortunately that is very much missing in India. A woman caught in a sexual abuse situation is more than likely to be stigmatised (we are Sita's country after all!!) let alone protected. <br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Sun, 9/7/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Sunday, September 7, 2008, 3:35 AM<br /><br /><br />Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their professional life.

			<div class="content">Hi Priya,<br /><br />    I did not discard it because of inhibitions, but primarily the fact that<br />I didnt want to be defensive when answering the question (been there, done<br />that, never won any sympathy <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />    So, I just mentioned the fact that I agree that women's position is<br />still not equal in our society... more than that it is inconsistent, like<br />somebody mentioned... some women do not get thier equal status, while some<br />misuse the laws to victimize men (I hear there are men's groups to counter<br />women misusing the law against them).<br /><br />   Anyways, what I said in my first mail was really what I thought counted.<br />That a vast majority of moderate women still struggle to be considered<br />equal.<br /><br />   I do not agree with the fact that women need to sacrifice 'femininity<br />(whats the darn spelling <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />' to become great. In fact, women should not<br />think about 'femininity'. I think 'femininity' itself is a male-dominated<br />concept. When a female lion fights its prey, the buck doesnt look at its<br />femininity, nor does the accompanying male. The very concept of femininity<br />(though makes the female look more dignified and beautiful), is a tool to<br />make women look different from men.<br /><br />    'From the heart': I think this is a more emotional issue than factual<br />for most women I have met. In all probability, they are respected, and<br />treated equal in the family (not in the society), but still long to do<br />something for the others who are not so privileged. It is like a a<br />well-educated person discussing illitracy, and not doing anything about it.<br /><br />    I thought I should say that, because, you mentioned that "there was not<br />much response to this topic". I wondered if you would have ever said that<br />about any other topic. Dont think so. Thats why I said that (Yes, I meant<br />that you were speaking from your heart).<br /><br />    I rest my case.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br />2008/9/6 Priya Balachandran <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Madan, Thanks for your response. You said you wrote a long reply and<br />  discarded being a male. There is nothing wrong in posting whatever your<br />  views are.  Please don&#39;t have any inhibitions.

If<br />  there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that<br />  &#39;people&#39; are not interested in responding - not that &#39;men&#39; do not respond.<br />  Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group<br />  &#40;apart from Malathy, of course <img src="/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" />. And also you seem to equate the small<br />  subgroup this forum is to larger one that is the society.<br /> <br />  The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to<br />  &#39;think&#39; from their heart when they talk this subject.

			<div class="content">Dear Anandhi, very heart warming to hear from you. <br />Â <br />Pazhamudhir solai opened when I was there, 8th grade i think. Just with lemon juice and sathukudi juice, small shop. How it has grown!! When I was young eating out was always Annapoorna. Annapoorna owners were our neighbors on subramanyam road - Chettiar and his wife and their 4 sons always courteous, we have been to all their family weddings and even grahapravesh when they moved to a palatial house on Periasamy theru. <br />Â <br />All the movies we watched were at Kennedy and Shanmuga. Kennedy manager wasour neighbor so mostly free, on rare occasions or if the movie is a huge hit then Rs 2 for balcony. Quite unimaginable nowadays.<br />Â <br />Yes in my time Kovai was called 'poor man's ooty' since it was very moderate climate wise, and lots of trees and greenery. The climate changes startedeven while i was there, am sure it is very hot now.But as you say hope it stays thatÂ same in so many nostalgic waysÂ :))<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Mon, 9/8/08, Anandhi Subramanian  wrote: <br /><br />From: Anandhi Subramanian <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Monday, September 8, 2008, 1:08 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malathi,<br />Â <br />Â  I lived inÂ R.S.Puram area too. I did my CÂ Programming from Aptech there long time back. The Aptech was near Pazhamudhir Cholai in RS puram. I started my carreer there as a data entry operator (the famous Tally software), for a Kannan Devan Tea agency also in RS.P. <br />Â <br />Â  R.S. Puram is one ofÂ myÂ favourite places there,Â next is Saibaba colony (these two are proofÂ for the richness of the city). I hope it stillstays the same even thoughÂ it is crowded and everything. Last time I wasin coimbatore was 4 yrs back.Â Had to go through lot of check posts to enter into the city. I have relatives lining from Singanallur toÂ Ganapathi to Perur.Â I can still remember the bus routesÂ and streets crystal clear.Â <br />Â <br />Â  I do see how spoilt the girls are there. Most of cousins are married and settled in coimbatore. Not just sari shopping, jewelry shoppingÂ too. Mythaatha wanted to get his daughters marriedÂ within coimbatore.Â They were very protective of their kids. Until I was 5 yrs old, we were in coimbatore and then movedÂ out. My father workedÂ for Kamala (not sure of the name - from the LMW family) mills there.Â Â <br />Â <br />Â Â  My chithappa used to write jokesÂ for AV (his name is KinathukadavuRavi). HeÂ is in R.S.Puram. My aunties in Ramanathapuram, Big Bazar Street (famous periya kadai veethi),Â cousins singanallur. I wasÂ visiting my auntÂ in Big Bazar street, coimbatore when the Pillaiyar drinkingÂ milkÂ episode happened. Part of my masters IÂ stayed in Sungam (near Nirmala College).<br />Â <br />Â Â I can write on and on, I willÂ stop here.<br />Â <br />AnandhiÂ ,___</div>

A woman caught in <br />a <br />  sexual abuse situation is more than likely to be stigmatised &#40;we <br />are <br />  Sita&#39;s country after all!!&#41; let alone protected. <br />    Â <br />    Malathi<br />    <br />    --- On Sun, 9/7/08, Udanx  wrote: <br />    <br />    From: Udanx <br />    Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men&#39;s mind set about women&#39;s <br />self-<br />  respect<br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Date: Sunday, September 7, 2008, 3:35 AM<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their <br />  professional life.

There is little/no <br />    protection from<br />        law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces <br />abuse <br />    from male<br />        managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so <br />  called<br />        professional environments - the woman being married is <br />perhaps <br />    only a little<br />        safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is <br />    interested <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />        But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their <br />    families.<br />       <br />        Malathi<br />       <br />        --- On *Sat, 9/6/08, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />  *wrote: <br />       <br />        From: Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />        Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men&#39;s mind set about <br />women&#39;s <br />    self-respect<br />        To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />        Date: Saturday, September 6, 2008, 11:14 AM<br />       <br />       <br />        Hi,<br />       <br />        some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian <br />    countries. They<br />        have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the <br />    powerful and<br />        autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh <br />    hasina,<br />        Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a <br />coterie <br />    group like<br />        Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up <br />  people <br />    who are<br />        actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.<br />       <br />        I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but <br />not<br />        authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many <br />    times, there<br />        might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a <br />  little<br />        determination and setting up of priorities can get them to <br />  break <br />    it.
