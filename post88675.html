			<div class="content">Hi Ramaswamy<br /><br />Yes, I think we need to salute Kalki for this. I would like to talk about my own perceptions of his writing style later on when I have more time.<br /><br />As of now, I would like everyone to consider the consequences of either not knowing our own history or not valuing our history and heritage enough -<br /><br />I think as a consequence, we have -<br /><br />Regressed as a society in every way.<br />We have had leaders like <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RC</acronym> and some others who have had amazing vision and definitely pride in what they believed was possible, yet - now, we have leaders of mediocre capabilities and practically no vision being paraded as the ultimate.<br />Are we richer today as a society - definitely not<br />Do we, as a society, have pride and dignity and prominence in the general scheme of things? - We do have people of exceptional individual talent, merit and capabilities but we have nothing significant as a society, compared to the heights achieved by the great rulers more a thousand years ago.<br />The area that we live in now as a state is considerably smaller than the times of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> & <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RC</acronym>; in fact its even smaller than the 2 states above us.<br />Even Ponni is not with us!<br /><br />I could go on, on this but I will suffice it to say that the first thing that needs to be taken up is inculcating our history to those around us and definitely to our younger generation. I hope each of us here will do his or her part in at least talking about it to the maximum no. from the younger generation.<br /><br />Best regards<br />Sandeep<br />singanallur ramaswamy  wrote: <br />Hi all,<br /><br />I am truly amazed by Mr Sandeep's posting. Is it true that even in South India the South Indian history is dismissed in just two pages.<br /><br />I thought it's the situation only in north, west and east of the country. Why didn't anyone, from the south who is an academic/scholar in Indian history, try and correct this inequality or even injustice? As far as I am concerned I have read mostly about Indus valley civilisation, Alexander the Great's forays, Gupta and Maurya periods, Mughal period including Shivaji, the British period and the fight for independence. The most detailed study concerning SI kings was about the Vijayanagar empire in the 15th century AD.<br /><br />The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and as far as I can remember there was next to nothing about the Cholas, let alone Raja Raja and Rajendra! That's the reason I was quite suprised to learn through this forum that Rajendra and Mohd of Gazni were contemporaries! And their paths could have crossed had Rajendra shifted his attention westwards from the Gangetic plains instead of going straight on the East coast.<br /><br />And I also never knew from the history lessons in school that he had defeated the Palas of Bengal. For that matter I have hardly learned anything in detail about the kingdoms of Bengal, Orissa, Karnataka or even Gujarat except that Gazni had plundered Somnath with repeated raids. Maharashtra escaped only because it produced a warrior like Shivaji and the long line of the Peshwas. I had not learned of even the kings who<br />had built the magnificent temples in Kajuraho.<br /><br />And strangely I never learned in school that Malik Kafur had come deep down into South and attacked Madurai. Why, I did not know the name of Kafur till much later in life.<br /><br />Perhaps had I taken history in college I might have studied these in some more detail, but school is the place where the entire Indian history, and not only of Bihar, UP, Delhi and Punjab, should be taught. No wonder the northerners know so little about SI languages and culture! What a shame!<br /><br />What about the Dravidian parties who shout from the roof-tops about their love for Tamil and Tamil culture? They have done precious little to correct this serious anamoly.<br /><br />In fact only through <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> did I learn a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> about the later Chola history and through <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> some part of Pallava period. We need to salute Kalki for the yeoman service he has done to open the eyes of at least some readers of historical romances (dismissed as escapist fare by some people) about the achievements of some Tamil kings!<br /><br />Ramaswamy<br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />From: preciousfeeling@...<br />Date: Wed, 22 Aug 2007 07:10:41 -0700<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Criticisms on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />I feel that it is absolutely essential to have the works of all similar authors of Tamil historical fiction to be translated to English. This is crucial to show the world, what we can call, our treasures and our unique history.<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and Cilapathikaram are excellent translations. These translators should be commended a lot for their efforts and hopefully this should inspire them to translate more works. Parthiban Kanavu has a good translation as well.

The school is divided<br />here.<br />    There are those who think literature should serve to lift your<br />  soul<br />    and others who think it should do nothing of that sort.<br />    I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are<br />    exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which<br />helps<br />  to<br />    refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no<br />relevance<br />  to<br />    the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true<br />from<br />    the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of<br />    today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical<br />and<br />    but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />    The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has<br />  proved<br />    it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known.<br />    When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect<br />directly<br />    with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as<br />it<br />    will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner<br />  workings<br />    of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym><br />  inside<br />    having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not<br />questionable,<br />    there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.<br />    This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The<br />    entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short<br />  story.<br />    Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha<br />    wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on<br />the<br />    workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />    climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine<br />  &#40;who<br />    swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the<br />    hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a<br />  saivite/vaishnavite&#41;<br />    and some inscription as base. Mix these in different<br />proportions<br />  you<br />    get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio.<br />    The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a<br />    larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called.<br />    The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life<br />    experiences and cannot be repeated.

The story is two episodes<br />&#40;Episode<br />    300<br />        and<br />            301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and<br />a<br />    piece<br />      of<br />            the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of<br />the<br />            episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into<br />thinking<br />      about<br />        the<br />            literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />            Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was<br />enamoured<br />    by<br />      the<br />            romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it<br />during<br />  my<br />        college<br />            days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />            For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and<br />  reading<br />    it<br />            doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there<br />are<br />    those<br />        of us<br />            who got interested in their history but I think the<br />    percentage<br />      is<br />            much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no<br />point<br />  in<br />            looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I<br />dont<br />    read,<br />            say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want<br />to<br />  do<br />      that<br />        I<br />            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />  for<br />      the<br />            sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon<br />the<br />      soul, I<br />            will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />            One book I read page by page for about a month with<br />lots of<br />            thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the<br />    mocking<br />        words<br />            by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the<br />      novel &#39;Sivagami<br />            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This<br />scathing<br />      remark<br />            criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning<br />the<br />        escapism in<br />            life.<br />           <br />            The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.

The most detailed study concerning SI kings was about <br />the Vijayanagar empire in the 15th century AD. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and as far as I can <br />remember there was next to nothing about the Cholas, let alone Raja</div></blockquote>Raja and Rajendra!

Its probably because <br />  I have a lot to say as well. The below post by Vijay Kumar has <br />  propelled me to take the first step and hopefully time permitting, <br />I <br />  look forward to regular contributions.<br />    <br />    First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was <br />introduced <br />  to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik <br />  Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my <br />  8th standard till now &#40;Im 40!&#41;. I am generally attracted to <br />  Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will <br />be <br />  the works of Ayn Rand. <br />    <br />    I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> school and there would not have been more <br />than <br />  a page or 2 about the South Indian Kings. It is such a terrible <br />  state of affairs that the only Indian kings who ruled kingdoms <br />  across the seas is hardly known in present day India. What has <br />  caused this? I think we have to take the blame ourselves for it. <br />    <br />    Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India did not rule the <br />  Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be dominated by <br />  others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This continues to <br />  this date so much so that a society is completely corrupted.<br />    <br />    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation states are <br />  fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and structures. We <br />  have to start by knowing and believing in our ancestry and building <br />  credible societies that have pride and dignity.<br />    <br />    More later<br />    Sandeep<br />    "Vijay Kumar .S"  <br />  wrote: to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the <br />  greatest king in india was Asoka, the <br />    greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his greatest <br />    contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism was <br />  from <br />    distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks wearning <br />  face <br />    masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of <br />  sravanabelagola, <br />    srilanka was a battle torn wilderness &#40; ok ten years ago i would <br />    look forward to the lux soaps n body spray bought by visitors <br />  from <br />    there&#41;<br />    <br />    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> opened my eyes to the greatness that has been forgotten &#40; or <br />    bulldozed&#41; by north indian versions of indian history <br />  compulsorily <br />    infused into our school history..to dwell deeper and realise the <br />    real greatness - lets call it true fame..meikirti. before that <br />  south <br />    indian kings were shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose <br />    costumes, buxom queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in <br />  the <br />    nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine <br />  in <br />    one hand &#40; enjoyed it though&#41; - some poor kavalali shouting raja <br />  thi <br />    raja, raja marthanda...<br />    <br />    to look at tanjore big temple, mahabalipuram in new light - not <br />  just <br />    taking an occasional visitor on a sightseeing trip - gawking at <br />  all <br />    the white skins there ` appreciating the stone work"...now a days <br />    its more a spiritual feeling, its no longer just stone or a <br />  statue. <br />    each one has a story to tell.<br />    <br />    when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 years ago and <br />    finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able <br />  to <br />    administer their vast country, to be just, to be loved by their <br />    subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the <br />  seas...i <br />    can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam <br />  and <br />    payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distant <br />  lanka, <br />    malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world <br />  the <br />    greatness of the tamilnadu.<br />    <br />    i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be <br />    more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational <br />    material than just a passing mention. i would love my son &#40; he is <br />    just learning to read and write&#41; to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and understand the <br />    greatness of the land he hails from.<br />    <br />    vj<br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />      literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided <br />  here. <br />      There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />    soul <br />      and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />      I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are <br />      exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which <br />  helps <br />    to <br />      refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no <br />  relevance <br />    to <br />      the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true <br />  from <br />      the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />      today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical <br />  and <br />      but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />      The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has <br />    proved <br />      it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />      When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect <br />  directly <br />      with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as <br />  it <br />      will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />    workings <br />      of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> <br />    inside <br />      having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not <br />  questionable, <br />      there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />      This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />      entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />    story. <br />      Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha <br />      wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on <br />  the <br />      workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />      climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine <br />    &#40;who <br />      swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the <br />      hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a <br />    saivite/vaishnavite&#41; <br />      and some inscription as base. Mix these in different <br />  proportions <br />    you <br />      get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />      The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />      larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called. <br />      The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life <br />      experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />      Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu <br />      Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc. <br />    Each <br />      is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is <br />  no <br />      comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />  worthiness <br />      of the former is much higher than the later. I consider &#39;Thyaga <br />      boomi&#39; and &#39;Alai Osai&#39; on a higher plane than <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly <br />  the <br />      same reason.<br />      <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        hi sirs,<br />        <br />        to anyone who has read kalki&#39;s works - the first thing you <br />      realise, <br />        is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />    the <br />        novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that <br />  is <br />      the <br />        foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can <br />  do <br />        that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime <br />  a <br />        dozen movies released everyday - the fact that <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />  still <br />      hold <br />        their own.<br />        <br />        the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />        background research that has gone into the historic fiction &#40; <br />  i <br />      dont <br />        think you can straight away classify <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as a romance ...ss to <br />    some <br />        extent&#41; - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />    three <br />        culverts - and to spin a web that had &#40; and is still is&#41; <br />    capturing <br />        the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in <br />  these <br />        works.<br />        <br />        lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />        characters or the fictional ones - Kalki&#39;s portrayal of each <br />  and <br />        every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them <br />  is <br />      the <br />        crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />        glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life <br />  and <br />        blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown <br />  to <br />      be <br />        calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />        <br />        if you poll in this site - how many people picked up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> <br />    and <br />        finished it without a break when compared to other works is <br />  but <br />        enough proof.<br />        <br />        rgds<br />        vj<br />        <br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />         wrote:<br />         <br />          One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />        everyone <br />          else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />      inferior <br />          feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated <br />  with <br />    the <br />          reading itself.<br />          <br />          "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />      clearly. <br />        He <br />          just chose the stories to be published. May be you should <br />  be <br />          asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know <br />  where <br />        this <br />          guy is. And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />    novels <br />          depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />      great <br />          novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, <br />  abusing <br />    him <br />          actually shows ignorance. <br />          <br />          Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. <br />  If <br />      you <br />          cannot read past two pages of &#39;Oru puliyamarathin Kathai&#39; <br />      or &#39;Moga <br />          mull&#39;, that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />    depletes <br />        the <br />          place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />          <br />          By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />    but <br />        has <br />          read &#39;Paradise lost&#39; completely &#40;which I find it difficult <br />  to <br />      read <br />          even the title page&#41;. Thus, &#39;easier to read&#39; criteria does <br />  not <br />        make <br />          anything great or add any literary value. <br />          <br />          Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />    hold <br />          good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at <br />  our <br />          assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br />          <br />          Coming back to Venkatesh&#39;s point that we need to define <br />  what <br />          literature is, I would think any good literature to record <br />    life <br />      as <br />          it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />      Ofcourse, <br />          this is one person&#39;s view. What say you?<br />          <br />          The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary <br />  value <br />    of <br />          <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />          <br />          Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />        Asokamithran, <br />          Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br />          <br />          Muthu Prakash R<br />          <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  <br />  wrote:<br />           <br />            I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn <br />  Kadhai. <br />    I <br />          have heard<br />            thats the best book ever written.

Ofcourse, there <br />  are <br />      those <br />          of us<br />              who got interested in their history but I think the <br />      percentage <br />        is<br />              much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no <br />  point <br />    in<br />              looking for things to improve upon the soul also.

			<div class="content">We have so much info in our archives - am sure we can cull a chapter <br />on chola history & pandya history from them. it can then be <br />edited/proof read and brought out as a free handout/pdf file or pushed <br />through proper channels to include into the syllabus as they deem fit. <br />So that our laments dont just stop with posts in this group.</div>

			<div class="content">I fully agree with Sri Venkatesh.<br /><br />1. School text books will give only a politically correct and approved<br />version of history. At least in my school days, I had access to books by<br />different authors and publishers, giving slightly different version of<br />the incidents. Even that luxury is not available, I think, nowadays.<br />Text books writing and publishing by NCERT only add to the woes.<br /><br />2. Regarding preserving and publishing manuscripts - the organizations,<br />both private and government, libraries etc. will face enormous hurdles,<br />resource crunches and time - and will not be able to do it in the<br />foreseeable future. Like Project Madurai (excellent effort and service),<br />a similar effort must be initiated with volunteers to type and host the<br />manuscripts from scanned or xeroxed copies. About 1000 volunteers will<br />achieve a lot in one year.<br /><br />3. Another way to 'expose' is to write monographs on specific<br />topics,personalities and events of historical importance, and bring all<br />known data - written, oral etc. - in one document with references<br />available, of course without bias. Such monographs written by experts<br />will help rapid dissemination of knowledge. RV's info about Kattabomman<br />is ripe material for a monograph.<br /><br />Sampath<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-Hi All<br /> <br />  I have been deeply interested in history ever since my schooldays and<br />  as many said i had to search for details outside the textbooks.<br />  but then how many of us know the true history.<br /> <br />  we have been led by the movies and books in paths that are contrary<br />  to true facts.</div></blockquote></div>
