R. A. Narasiah recently spoke at the Stage Archaeology <br />Department's monthly lecture forum on `Early Navigation and Ships of <br />Tamil Nadu', this former Chief Engineer, Ports, and an international <br />maritime consultant, whose hobby is now writing about the <br />historical, showed only two pictures of ships prior to the colonial <br />era. One was a sketch from Colonising Java by K.N. Pannikkar and the <br />other was the picture which appeared in these columns on August 1. <br />The former was based on the bas relief in Borobudur. The latter, <br />Narasiah regretted, when we chatted about his talk, had been rather <br />`abbreviated' in the reproduction. I make good that lapse by <br />reproducing the full picture here, anchor, fish, keel and all. The <br />ship, however, he did not think was an Indian sailing vessel. <br /><br />Narasiah, who had spent a couple of years with the World Bank in <br />Cambodia, had seen several bas reliefs of ships and sailors in <br />Angkor Wat. These, he had been told, were representations of 12th <br />Century naval battles between the Khmers and the Chams. The former <br />were heirs to a kingdom which drew its inspiration from India, the <br />latter from the Chinese. The Chola maritime tradition, which was the <br />greatest of the Tamil maritime traditions, according to Narasiah, <br />coincided with this period when it was part of Southeast Asian <br />maritime history, with Chola expansionism at the time stretching <br />from Malacca to present-day Vietnam by way of Sumatra and Java. <br /><br />Predating Chola maritime adventures were the Pallava ships which <br />sailed from Mamallapuam and Mylapore to these lands of the east and <br />which could well have influenced the predecessors of the Khmers. In <br />this context, whether the ships at Angkor Wat were Khmer or Cham, <br />their designing and navigational skills could very well have derived <br />from the Pallavas and the Cholas. Be that as it may, if the Angkor <br />Wat ship in my picture was Khmer or Cham, we are then once again <br />down to one representation anywhere of a pre-colonial Tamil ship, <br />the one at Borobudur. I doubt whether the dhonis found on some <br />Pandya coins could have carried armies as far as the East Indies. <br /><br />Offering some details about early Tamil maritime history, Narasiah <br />pointed out that outward sailings were in January-February and some <br />of the major ports were between Kodikkarai (Point Calimere) and <br />Tondi. The Archaeological Department has itself been excavating at <br />Korkai and Alangulam, near Ramanathapuram, where they have found <br />several Roman relics. But this tends to draw the focus away from <br />Chola Nadu to Pandya Nadu. But be they Chera, Chola, Pandya or <br />Pallava sailors, they all had a heritage of navigatory skills, using <br />tamed birds to search for shore, the smell of the air, and the rule <br />of thumb ( veral kanakku) to follow the eight major stars and the 48 <br />minor ones. <br /><br />One thing I forgot to ask Narasiah was the source of timber for <br />early Tamil ships. Iluppai and Punnai are found in Tamaizhagam, but <br />teak? Is teak native to this part of the country, or was it <br />imported? And if so, how?</div>

One was a sketch from Colonising Java by K.N.

These, he had been told, were representations of <br />12th <br />    Century naval battles between the Khmers and the Chams. The <br />former <br />    were heirs to a kingdom which drew its inspiration from India, <br />the <br />    latter from the Chinese.

Be that as it may, if the <br />Angkor <br />    Wat ship in my picture was Khmer or Cham, we are then once again <br />    down to one representation anywhere of a pre-colonial Tamil <br />ship, <br />    the one at Borobudur. I doubt whether the dhonis found on some <br />    Pandya coins could have carried armies as far as the East <br />Indies. <br />    <br />    Offering some details about early Tamil maritime history, <br />Narasiah <br />    pointed out that outward sailings were in January-February and <br />some <br />    of the major ports were between Kodikkarai &#40;Point Calimere&#41; and <br />    Tondi. The Archaeological Department has itself been excavating <br />at <br />    Korkai and Alangulam, near Ramanathapuram, where they have found <br />    several Roman relics. But this tends to draw the focus away from <br />    Chola Nadu to Pandya Nadu. But be they Chera, Chola, Pandya or <br />    Pallava sailors, they all had a heritage of navigatory skills, <br />  using <br />    tamed birds to search for shore, the smell of the air, and the <br />rule <br />    of thumb &#40; veral kanakku&#41; to follow the eight major stars and <br />the <br />  48 <br />    minor ones. <br />    <br />    One thing I forgot to ask Narasiah was the source of timber for <br />    early Tamil ships.

			<div class="content">Hi bala sir<br /><br />in the last link mentioned,the author has translated kandalur <br />shala ...as the roads of kandalur? shouldnt it be translated as <br />school ( shalai .sanskrit i/o salai tamil??)<br /><br />rgds<br />vj<br /><br />After Cenkuttuvan, the power of the Cera kingdom<br />appears to have been eclipsed by that of the Pandyas,<br />and an almost impenetrable veil is cast over Cera<br />naval operations till we come down to the palmy days<br />of the Cola empire. From: epigraphic evidence we learn<br />that in the twelfth year of the reign of Rajaraja I,<br />the Cera fleet fought with the Cola navy in the<br />'Roads of Kandalur,' but was routed. The Cera navy<br />was no doubt weakened by this defeat. But it survived<br />the shock, and in the time of Rajadhiraja (1042-52<br />A.D.) it again fought its Cola rival at<br />Kandalur-salai, "on the never-decreasing ocean." This<br />second venture was attended with no better fate than<br />the first. The Cera fleet was again defeated and<br />probably destroyed.(3)<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "s.balasubramani" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear vijaymay be useful<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-12/msg00581.html">http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-12/msg00581.html</a><!-- m --><br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.co.in/search">http://www.google.co.in/search</a><!-- m -->?<br />  hl=en&q=indian+timbers+for+ancient+ship+building&meta=<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/cha.htm">http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/cha.htm</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/08/29/stories/2005082900180501.htm">http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/08/29/stor ... 180501.htm</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    When K.
