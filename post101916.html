I would<br />  like to work on Mahabalipuram. Let me explain why. If the matter is not<br />  interesting to you, just click &#39;DELETE&#39;. I can assure you that you would<br />  have lost nothing. I don&#39;t expect every one would share my interests.<br /> <br />  I did an extensive study of Ajanta. The objective was two-fold. One to<br />  satisfy my curiosity, and the other, which became a passion for me later,to<br />  take such heritage sites to common people.<br /> <br />  When I had completed work on Ajanta to some respectable level, I was due<br />  for retirement. Around that time I was planning to take up a detailed<br />  documentation of my native district, Pudukkottai. That I did get a golden<br />  opportunity, which I botched up is a different matter. During all these<br />  period one that was always in my mind was Mahabalipuram, though in between I<br />  was infatuated by Darasuram also.<br /> <br />  Now as I have shifted to Chennai, the most logical would be to concentrate<br />  on Mahabalipuram. The choice is clear. It was in my original agenda nd aathe<br />  site is so near. I thought that it may be useful to explain, at least for<br />  me, why Mahabalipuram attracts me.<br /> <br />  First it is the Pallava grace. There is something which makes the Pallava<br />  sculptures irresistible. The Cholas might have been grander. But the dainty<br />  Pallava monuments are great aesthetic pleasure. History of Tamil temple<br />  architecture, that is what is physically available to us, starts with the<br />  Pallavas and the Pandyas. Both wrought their master pieces on hard granite,<br />  a feat never attempted after Asoka did in Bihar. Then, right on their very<br />  first attempt the Pallavas produced unexcelled art. We have no trace of<br />  their experimentation. Can the craft-persons drawn from the nearest trades,<br />  carpenters, masons, ivory carvers and jewellers be equal to the task?<br />  Obviously they were, as we see their output. This is a good reason for my<br />  interest in the Pallavas.<br /> <br />  Then, why Mahabalipuram? Isn&#39;t Mahabalipuram is one-stop shop for the<br />  Pallava&#39;s plastic art? The entire gamut of temple architecture you see<br />  within walking distance: the cave-temples &#40;oh, of such a variety&#41;, the<br />  monoliths &#40;the pioneering effort&#41;, open-<acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>bas-relief &#40;never attempted by<br />  others before or after&#41; and structural temples! Cave-temples are no great<br />  big deal, Asoka started this almost a millennium before. The arch-rival of<br />  the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, beat them at the post; they excavated<br />  cave-temples a few decades before the Kanchi dynasty. But, undoubtedly<br />  monoliths are the Pallava&#39;s unmatched contribution to the world of art.<br />  There had been a few who took inspiration, like the Rashtrakutas, whose<br />  Kailasanatha at Ellora art extraordinary. But, the open-<acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>bas reliefs,<br />  like the Arjuna&#39;s Penance, could not even be attempted! The Pallava<br />  contribution to temple architecture is exceptional, and Mahabalipuram is<br />  their museum!<br /> <br />  OK, all these would interest morons like me. What about normal people?<br />  Fortunately there is enough masala in Mahabalipuram for all kinds of taste.<br />  It abounds mysteries. How did Mamallapuram become Mahabalipuram, is not too<br />  exciting. But one would definitely like to know why all most all the<br />  monuments are left unfinished. We are reminded of the Tiruppati barber<br />  story. Pardon me for this blasphemer humour!<br /> <br />  Why did they choose Mahabalipuram, I would like to know. It was a<br />  flourishing port for ages is not sufficient reason. The scraggy hillocks and<br />  scant vegetation do not make the place quite attractive. Nor is that close<br />  to the capital, Kanchi, by the contemporary standard. Then why? I would like<br />  to know.<br /> <br />  There is confusion in the names, strewn all over. Leave alone the name of<br />  the place, whose original name after the great Pallava warrior king,<br />  Mamalla. Why call the stone &#40;monolith&#41; temples rathas? They don&#39;t move. And<br />  they are dedicated to the traditional Hindu gods, and have no relation with<br />  the Mahabharata heros. Actually there is no justification what so ever<br />  except that there are five monuments. The marvel of a bas-relief, the<br />  largest in the world, is a great puzzle. The protagonists of Arjuna and of<br />  Bhagiratha are equally convincing in their arguments.<br /> <br />  Who among the Pallavas were the authors of the monuments is still an<br />  unsettled question. You may now pitch in; God knows you may come up with<br />  another plausible theory, the &#39;n&#39; plus oneth, to add to the confusion! The<br />  arguments forwarded by various experts remind me of the Perry Mason<br />  mysteries, how every character comes out with a cogent story who the killer<br />  was!<br /> <br />  Mahendra Pallava initiated excavating cave-temples in the Tamil country<br />  and temple building was continued vigorously by his descendents. As we can<br />  imagine the earliest ones must simple in concept and in execution. Thus one<br />  can follow the development of temple architecture through the degree of<br />  sophistication. Pillar, we are told, is a very important distinguishing<br />  feature. You can see that the Mahendra&#39;s were simple, whereas the successors<br />  bought in progressive improvements. But what do you do if two different<br />  kinds of pillar are found in the same cave temple? Sculpture is another<br />  discriminator. Again we are perplexed. One expects progressing refinement.<br />  But the Tiruchy Gangadhara of Mahendra, one of the earliest sculptures, is a<br />  master piece.<br /> <br />  To confound the matter, the Pallava kings had decorated themselves with a<br />  number of title giving clues to the penchant for this among the modern<br />  leaders! Unfortunately many are common to multiple kings. Some later raja<br />  made changes in the structure and inscribed his name on it. Some even took<br />  credit, actually appropriated, for some of these monuments without<br />  contributing to it! After all even the royalty, that prided itself as<br />  descendants of Bharadwaja, suffered from human frailties!<br /> <br />  There was also vandalism! The sectarian feud, between the Saivaits and the<br />  Vaishavaits did incalculable harm. An over-anxious saivaite Pallava king<br />  attempted some crude modifications to some Vishnu shrines it looks. But when<br />  the Vaishanavite zealots appropriated some temples some of the great works<br />  of art, in addition to their being objects of worship, have been mutilated<br />  or obliterated. I couldn&#39;t believe this.<br /> <br />  Do you know that most of thee Mahabalipuram sculptures have mutilated<br />  nose? What happened? Some say that the conquering Chalukyas did it. All<br />  these make a painful reading, nevertheless fascinating studying human<br />  weakness.<br /> <br />  We have references to Mahabalipuram, or for that matter, a great port in<br />  the location where we find Mahabalipuram today from the beginning of the<br />  Christian era. The interest on the monuments dates from the coming of the<br />  Westerners. It looks the same story every where. We made them, worshippedin<br />  them, forgotten them and allowed then to disintegrate! It isn&#39;t a happy<br />  story. We have references to citing Seven pagodas in the early mariners&#39;<br />  notes. What are these Pagadas? Most likely the temples like the Shore<br />  Temple. Where there seven of them, for we can see the spires of the two of<br />  the Shore Temple? There is a popular belief that most of them were swallowed<br />  by the sea. But from all our records the Shore Temple was all the time there<br />  on the Shore. The local people also believe a huge township is under water.<br />  It activated people like Graham Hancock, who has been searching for<br />  forgotten civilisations, and he along with the Indian National Institute<br />  of Oceanography and the Scientific Exploration Society, UK made joint<br />  exploration. The team claim that there is a submerged city covering a few<br />  square kilometers. Tsumai last year seem to have unearthed &#40;literally&#41; some<br />  structures, and this generated considerable excitement. The <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has even<br />  reported citing a Sangam age temple. This is very important, for our history<br />  of temple architecture could be pushed back by 600 years. But, we shall wait<br />  and watch. Once sedate, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has now become sensational! You may recollect<br />  the fanfare with which the finding of Brahmi inscription in Adichanallur was<br />  announced as belonging to the 5 th century BC? There is no news further on<br />  this path-breaking announcement.<br /> <br />  The major part of the period under discussion, 7 th-9th centuries, was a<br />  period of great religious significance. It is the bhakti era. During this<br />  period there occurred two movements which altered the course of Indian<br />  cultural and religious history. Both these emanated from the South. One was<br />  the Bhakti cult initiated by the Shaivaite Tamil saints<br /> <br />  to take deep roots in the country - carried on by Jayadeva, Chaitanya,<br />  Tukaram, Mira and others. Mahendra Pallava was influenced by none other than<br />  Appar, to return to the Hindu-fold. It is a rare instance in history where a<br />  faith was driven out by poetry! And Bhutattazhvar was born in Mahabalipuram.<br /> <br /> <br />  The second was remarkable, not only because of its impact, but also<br />  because it was the work of a single man. Adi Shankara must have been an<br />  extraordinary genius. He set about reviving Hinduism - of a rather special<br />  intellectual kind. He traveled all over India and wherever he went he<br />  triumphed but he was a conqueror of the mind and in intellectual argument.<br />  He became a great leader of the intellectual class and at the same time<br />  caught the imagination of the masses. Quite surprisingly, the Mahabalipuran<br />  shrines, which seems to be a great achievement for us, left no impact on the<br />  saints. Only Vishnu, in the form of Anantasayanam, in the Shore Temple<br />  complex was sung by an Azhvar. We are not able to understand.<br /> <br />  Mahabalipuram&#39;s connection with literature is must have been colourful,<br />  but there is very little of reference to the town, let alone the great art<br />  treasure it houses. &#40;Kanchi at that time was one of the greatest cities. The<br />  Pallavas were great patrons of art and literature. Their court was studded<br />  with literary luminaries. Mahendra was himself a multifaceted personality.<br />  Dandi, the author of Kavyadarsa &#40;&#39;Morror on Poetry&#39;&#41;, an authoritative<br />  treatise on poetics, upon which the vast history of Sanskrit poetics rests,<br />  has adorned the court of Mamalla and his grand-son, Parameswara. There isa<br />  work attributed to Dandi, Avantisundara katha, the only Sanskrit literary<br />  text making mention of Mahabalipuram. Again surprising.<br /> <br />  There is suggestion by at least two authors to get out of the conundrum of<br />  the Great penance bas-relief. The solution seems to me very clever.<br />  According to them the authors meant a slesha &#40;siledai, in Tamil&#41;, that it<br />  means both of them at the same time. To imagine the author of the Great<br />  Penance to resort to such tricks is great excitement. He was capable of<br />  this. Hasn&#39;t he wrought something original, actually two, the monoliths and<br />  the bas-relief? We may remember that in the contemporary literary world such<br />  tricks were &#39;in-things&#39;. The Pallava court poet Dandin, author of<br />  kavyadarsa, has also composed, now lost but for one stanza, a two-in-one<br />  kavya, dvi-samdhana-kavya. Significantly, Dandin&#39;s Ragahva-Pandaviya is a<br />  bitexual narration, the same text capable of being read in two different<br />  ways, of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.<br /> <br />  The very fact that most of the monuments are unfinished, let me also add,<br />  in various stages of incompletion, would help us study the very process of<br />  temple architecture. In fact one can consider this as graded tutorials!<br /> <br />  The list is long. I shall now venture into how we can present the<br />  Mahabalipuram monuments to the public. Before that what the monuments offer<br />  is worth looking at.<br /> <br />  In my opinion Mahabalipuram offers excellent scope for literature suitable<br />  to various age groups.<br /> <br />  - a picture book, mostly pictures, with very little text, for<br />  children<br />  - a picture book on the Amar Chitra Katha model<br />  - an excellent tourist guide<br />  - an audio tourist guide<br />  - a monograph<br />  - an interactive CD<br />  - a series of presentation materials for schools, and finally,<br />  - regular residential camps on art appreciation.<br /> <br />  These are the suggestions from my limited understanding of the subject<br />  and still limited originality. Others may come up with more useful, fruitful<br />  and clever ideas. I am ready to join.<br /> <br />  S.

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by Chandrasekaran  using id chandra_jgp</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear sridhar Ratnam,<br />I have already started communication with the great prof <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and am<br />charting plans to join his endeavours. even though I would still<br />continue as a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group member, I want all mature members to give<br />respect to age, educational background and concern to some people who<br />dont rely on ever weeping episodes in TVs and wane away their retired<br />life!

Dr.Satnam<br />as a moderator, has done his best to keep both groups at their own<br />limits, but it is for each member to inculcate sense of participation<br />to the other side too. If that does't happen, one-manness and bias<br />will creep into this beautiful enriched, educated group. We should not<br />allow this to happen.<br />Edirpaarpudan,<br />Chandrasekaran</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Mr. Chandrasekaran.<br /><br />With great humility i would also like to putforth my observations. <br /><br />by the way i have not seen anybody write any "ridiculous" comments <br />on anything, everything and everybody. can u please be more specific.<br /><br />pls understand sir, all comments were passed on the literary <br />characters and not on any individuals who are members in our group  <br />as such . and where a member has been commented upon , it was taken <br />in the right sense even by the person who was being commented and <br />there were even retorts from the same member which is also being <br />taken in the right sense.<br /><br />Just like somebody can ridicule that people get fame and take pride <br />by writing witty mails everybody has right to say so. Freedom of <br />speech sir. The limits of that is known to everybody.<br /><br />Even in your mail you have ridiculed the TV serials. would it <br />tantamount to ridiculing the producer, the director , the cre, the <br />actors related to the serial???<br /><br />I strongly feel that all have a right to comment upon and even <br />ridicule as u said on a literary character. <br /><br />Poonguzhali is a literary character .. even the ardent fan of <br />poonguzhali in our group takes the character analysis of poonguzhali <br />in the right sense. I dont know why such a character analysis should <br />not be done. If one has to make only observatios toeing the line of <br />the author, then why sould we even analyse???? <br /><br />For instance, who is vandiyadevan?? does ridiculing vandiyadevan a <br />tort? <br /><br />nobody even knows the ancestral details of vandhiyadevan and we are <br />just talking about possibilities of his lineage and nobody knows <br />about his real existence. just one word about vandhiyadevan in  <br />kalvettu to my kowledge, as told by our members who are experiened <br />in kalvettu reading, prompted kalki to make him a Hero. <br /><br />If somebody can say that vandhiyadevan or any other literary <br />character cannot be ridicled , i am tempted to ask "why"??<br /><br />leave alone literary character... why can't a historical person be <br />ridiculed???  <br /><br />" Tughlaq" i think is the most ridiculed because of his shifting of <br />capital... but lot of evidences are there to prove his administerial <br />abilities.. still he is ridiculed ... <br /><br />Even Akbar the great changed capitals.. but he is not ridiculed .. <br />then why single Tughlaq alone??? because a play was made using him <br />as a character .... yet nobody whimpered why a King was the target <br />of mockery...<br /><br />aurangazed.. was a simple man who used to even knit his own dress <br />according to what the quoran says.. still he is the most hated <br />person due to various reasons and mythys associated with him.<br /><br />Rabindranath Tagore(for our national anthem), Subrahmanya Bharathi ( <br />you know when he used to walk in triplicane.. people used to <br />tell "paithiyam pogudhu paaru", also he was ridiculed for singing in <br />rpaise of "wales ilavarasar"), Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna <br />paramahamsa ( if u want, i will tell you in a personal mail what <br />mockery was made of ramakrishna paramahamsa) The Great Mahatma <br />Gandhi is still being made a mockery of. <br /><br />The great saint "vallalar" was the object of mockery once. hope you <br />know this. <br /><br />"yaazhpaanam aarumuga naavalar" called vallalar's "arutpa" <br />as "Marutpa" and even filed a case against him in the court, that <br />was later dismissed anyway.<br /><br />Pls understand sir, nobody ridicules just for the sake of ridiculing <br />and curtailing participation from the other side. It is just an <br />attempt to kindle the participation to a greater extent and to <br />understand the other side of the coin too... <br /><br />this sort of ridiculing or kindling and mockery wud make us stronger <br />and do a lot of introspection regarding the historical characters <br />which wud be a great asset when some outsider comes and makes the <br />same observation.<br /><br /><br />hope you would appreciate my stand. <br /><br />Also, your point on allowing participation and free flow of thought <br />is a valid observation.<br /><br />But by saying that one cannot even ridicule a person, i think u are <br />making the mistake of curtailing participation. This would not lead <br />to any fruitful discussions in the group. Rather it would just be <br />another "kilippilaigal..." group. <br /><br />as observed by you, The same one-maness, biased observation will <br />creep in if an analysis should not be made in the group.<br /><br />When you see the prof's mail, the prof too has made the same <br />observation .<br /><br />in the second point of mail he says that thee attitude that "cholas <br />cannot go wrong" will lead us to nowhere and truth cannot be <br />revealed , and it is this reason also which has prompted him to <br />write such a mail. <br /><br />Why has he made such an observation??? what prompted him to write <br />in such a manner?<br /><br />Time for introspection regarding this too by our honourable group <br />members.<br /><br />With Regards<br /><br />B.

I was <br />surprised why you replied back to me!!<br />Having known your knowledge in various subjects to ponder, your this <br />reply to me was much informative than many other mails of ridicule. I <br />also am not interested in pin pointing anyone. Did I? When Dr.Sridhar <br />Ratnam quoted..`my head hung in shame.' I too felt the same way. But <br />it should not be to an extent of making an elderly scholar leave our <br />group. Mockey or ridicule may not be taken easily by members of all <br />age group. Isn't it? Where we have to give respect, we have to. To <br />get back the same respect- as you said the other side of the coin <br />need not be checked for people beyond our age group and reach. If <br />possible you can read through what he writes, or otherwise you have <br />the choice of moving on to the next message. Similarly myself- I just <br />skip on such mails of personal chat or mockery w/o substance. <br />But the main theme of this subject should not be lost- we should <br />leave no stone unturned to bring back men like Prof. who are more <br />knowledgeable and informative to group like ours. That was the point <br />I was trying to prove. Nothing else.<br /><br />Also, a humble request. When members reply back, they can please <br />remove the messages that are stuck along- ( Should I explain? I don't <br />think it is needed! But still I have to say..Just take the cursor <br />within the reply box, click, go to edit|select all|delete). Then the <br />whole reply box becomes empty and clean.

Please do not take <br />it as a personal mail.<br /><br />Since, it was also coming as a sequel to other mails on the same <br />subject, i took the liberty of using the opportunity to continue <br />the thread.<br /><br />Yes, i completely agree to your view that all elderly knowledgeable <br />people should at all cost be retained in this group. But i dont <br />understand what ridicule has been made. <br /><br />May be some ridiculing might have happenned in the background which <br />i may not be aware. Iam not interested in knowing that too. But <br />anyway, if such ridiculing has happenned it should be condemned in <br />the strongest of words.<br /><br />What i wanted to convey too is that the honble prof has made some <br />remarks in the second part of the mail too , which has easily been <br />forgotton and sidelined . <br /><br />Let us also give a thought to that also. <br /><br />With Regards<br /><br />B.
