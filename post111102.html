All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />  Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />  achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />  credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />  but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />  through surrender.<br />  <br />  What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about <br />  Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in <br />their <br />  own faith as Hindus.

It <br />    makes no sense to argue that EVR fought &#39;within&#39; or &#39;without&#39; <br />    boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />faith. <br />  In <br />    fact Gandhi&#39;s own disagreement with EVR was this &#39;eye for an eye&#39; <br />    approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />    other side. <br />    <br />    Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />with <br />    knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />how <br />  to <br />    do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a&#39;la Ramana <br />    Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />    profess hate or dislike of anybody else&#39;s faith.<br />    <br />    I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />to <br />    aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!!

Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />  based <br />    teaching system.Ã‚Â He too had faultered here and there. But <br />remember, <br />    but for RajajiÃ‚Â and UVSÃ‚Â Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚Â all the <br />    oppressedÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />    happened now.Ã‚Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />them.<br />      <br />      And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />the <br />    social cause. IÃ‚Â only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />    within the faith. AsÃ‚Â all of us know, his parentsÃ‚Â and ancestors <br />  were <br />    all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚Â family of <br />ardent <br />    believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as <br />his <br />    inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />    believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, <br />why <br />    he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />  didÃ‚Â not <br />    haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />to <br />    fight from within.<br />      <br />      I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist. But <br />my <br />    upfront question was why toÃ‚Â garland the idols with chappals, <br />just <br />    toÃ‚Â exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚Â And is this act, not <br />  similar <br />    to whatÃ‚Â a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚Â the churches today. When a <br />    Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚Â this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />is <br />    Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />      <br />      This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />    Sunnambu".Ã‚Â &#40;PleaseÃ‚Â do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />    towardsÃ‚Â you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />    decried in my previous post&#41;<br />      <br />      Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />    league ofÃ‚Â those who fought forÃ‚Â social upliftment while <br />remaining <br />    within the fight.Ã‚Â And remember, to comeÃ‚Â out of the faith and <br />fight <br />    against it is a very easy, butÃ‚Â think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />    Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚Â had to face whileÃ‚Â fighting for <br />the <br />    cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />    particular.Ã‚Â Needless toÃ‚Â say that this extends to everyone <br />    whoÃ‚Â fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚Â socialÃ‚Â equality <br />while <br />    remaining within the faith. <br />      <br />      Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â Nayanmars,Ã‚Â impressEVR. <br />    Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />    discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they <br />  mixed <br />    no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />    theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate <br />in <br />    theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />    this, whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from <br />    theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â too. <br />      <br />      SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />knowledgeÃ‚Â nor <br />    the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an <br />AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar <br />    or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the <br />  faith.<br />      Ã‚Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      ----- Original Message ----<br />      From: Vairam <br />      To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />      Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />      Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships ravana....<br />      <br />      <br />      Venkatesh,<br />      Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />very <br />      very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.

Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />      religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the faith and fight. <br />He <br />    did <br />      become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />other <br />      hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />Iyer, <br />    all <br />      wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â "practising"ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â believed in <br />God <br />    and fought <br />      with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />        <br />        In fact, whileÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument <br />wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â veryÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â valid <br />    regarding <br />      the irrationalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and illogicalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â methods being followed, <br />    IÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â think that <br />      he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â or tenets of <br />  Hinduism, <br />      before deciding to take onÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â it.

But his argument that <br />one <br />      should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel <br />  with <br />      true rationalism.<br />        <br />        And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />well, <br />      then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />    Pillayar <br />      withÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â chappals?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the <br />    discriminating <br />      Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods?

It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />      makes no sense to argue that EVR fought &#39;within&#39; or &#39;without&#39; <br />      boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />  faith. <br />    In <br />      fact Gandhi&#39;s own disagreement with EVR was this &#39;eye for an <br />eye&#39; <br />      approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />      other side. <br />      <br />      Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />  with <br />      knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />  how <br />    to <br />      do.

Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />    based <br />      teaching system.Ã‚Â He too had faultered here and there. But <br />  remember, <br />      but for RajajiÃ‚Â and UVSÃ‚Â Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚Â all the <br />      oppressedÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â not have happened then. Fine that it could <br />have <br />      happened now.Ã‚Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />  them.<br />        <br />        And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />      social cause. IÃ‚Â only say that he could not do it while <br />remaining <br />      within the faith. AsÃ‚Â all of us know, his parentsÃ‚Â and ancestors <br />    were <br />      all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚Â family of <br />  ardent <br />      believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as <br />  his <br />      inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />      believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, <br />  why <br />      he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />    didÃ‚Â not <br />      haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />  to <br />      fight from within.<br />        <br />        I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist. But <br />  my <br />      upfront question was why toÃ‚Â garland the idols with chappals, <br />  just <br />      toÃ‚Â exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚Â And is this act, not <br />    similar <br />      to whatÃ‚Â a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚Â the churches today. When a <br />      Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚Â this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />  is <br />      Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />        <br />        This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />      Sunnambu".Ã‚Â &#40;PleaseÃ‚Â do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />      towardsÃ‚Â you, but the same government and the media houses that <br />I <br />      decried in my previous post&#41;<br />        <br />        Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />      league ofÃ‚Â those who fought forÃ‚Â social upliftment while <br />  remaining <br />      within the fight.Ã‚Â And remember, to comeÃ‚Â out of the faith and <br />  fight <br />      against it is a very easy, butÃ‚Â think of the revolts that an <br />Adhi <br />      Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚Â had to face whileÃ‚Â fighting for <br />  the <br />      cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />      particular.Ã‚Â Needless toÃ‚Â say that this extends to everyone <br />      whoÃ‚Â fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚Â socialÃ‚Â equality <br />  while <br />      remaining within the faith. <br />        <br />        Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â Nayanmars,Ã‚Â impress EVR. <br />      Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />      discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they <br />    mixed <br />      no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going <br />to <br />      theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually <br />discriminate <br />  in <br />      theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />      this, whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from <br />      theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â too. <br />        <br />        SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />  knowledgeÃ‚Â nor <br />      the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an <br />  AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar <br />      or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the <br />    faith.<br />        Ã‚Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        ----- Original Message ----<br />        From: Vairam <br />        To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />        Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />        Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />ravana....<br />        <br />        <br />        Venkatesh,<br />        Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />  very <br />        very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.

Okay, he did not get converted to <br />another <br />        religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the faith and fight. <br />  He <br />      did <br />        become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />        hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />      all <br />        wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â "practising"ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â believed in <br />  God <br />      and fought <br />        with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />          <br />          In fact, whileÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument <br />  wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â veryÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â valid <br />      regarding <br />        the irrationalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and illogicalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â methods being followed, <br />      IÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â think that <br />        he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â or tenets of <br />    Hinduism, <br />        before deciding to take onÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â it. On the other hand, all those <br />    four <br />        above andÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â thoseÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  <br />      scriptures than EVR <br />        and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />      withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the <br />        faith. <br />          <br />          So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we canÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â give to EVR is that, <br />  he <br />      did <br />        not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />        should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel <br />    with <br />        true rationalism.<br />          <br />          And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />        then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />      Pillayar <br />        withÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â chappals?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the <br />      discriminating <br />        Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods?

It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />      makes no sense to argue that EVR fought &#39;within&#39; or &#39;without&#39; <br />      boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />  faith. <br />    In <br />      fact Gandhi&#39;s own disagreement with EVR was this &#39;eye for an <br />eye&#39; <br />      approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />      other side. <br />      <br />      Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />  with <br />      knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />  how <br />    to <br />      do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a&#39;la Ramana <br />      Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did <br />he <br />      profess hate or dislike of anybody else&#39;s faith.<br />      <br />      I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />  to <br />      aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />      recommended is Paula Richman&#39;s Many Ramayanas &#40;available on <br />  Amazon&#41;.<br />      <br />      Malathi<br />      --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Thirumalai Vinjamoor <br />    Venkatesh <br />       wrote: <br />       <br />        Vairam,<br />        <br />        Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />    based <br />      teaching system.Ã‚ He too had faultered here and there. But <br />  remember, <br />      but for RajajiÃ‚ and UVSÃ‚ Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚ all the <br />      oppressedÃ‚ wouldÃ‚ not have happened then. Fine that it could <br />have <br />      happened now.Ã‚ But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />  them.<br />        <br />        And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />      social cause. IÃ‚ only say that he could not do it while <br />remaining <br />      within the faith. AsÃ‚ all of us know, his parentsÃ‚ and ancestors <br />    were <br />      all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚ family of <br />  ardent <br />      believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚ &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚ itas <br />  his <br />      inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />      believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚ reasons given, toÃ‚ explain, <br />  why <br />      he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />    didÃ‚ not <br />      haveÃ‚ either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />  to <br />      fight from within.<br />        <br />        I amÃ‚ even fine with the fact that heÃ‚ became an atheist.But <br />  my <br />      upfront question was why toÃ‚ garland the idols with chappals, <br />  just <br />      toÃ‚ exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚ And is this act, not <br />    similar <br />      to whatÃ‚ a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚ the churches today. When a <br />      Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚ this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />  is <br />      Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />        <br />        This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />      Sunnambu".Ã‚ &#40;PleaseÃ‚ do not mistake me. I am not directingthis <br />      towardsÃ‚ you, but the same government and the media houses that <br />I <br />      decried in my previous post&#41;<br />        <br />        Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />      league ofÃ‚ those who fought forÃ‚ social upliftment while <br />  remaining <br />      within the fight.Ã‚ And remember, to comeÃ‚ out of the faith and <br />  fight <br />      against it is a very easy, butÃ‚ think of the revolts that an <br />Adhi <br />      Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚ had to face whileÃ‚ fighting for <br />  the <br />      cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />      particular.Ã‚ Needless toÃ‚ say that this extends to everyone <br />      whoÃ‚ fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚ socialÃ‚ equality <br />  while <br />      remaining within the faith. <br />        <br />        Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚ orÃ‚ Nayanmars,Ã‚ impress EVR. <br />      Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />      discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚ they <br />    mixed <br />      no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going <br />to <br />      theÃ‚ extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually <br />discriminate <br />  in <br />      theÃ‚ name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />      this, whileÃ‚ others can given ample references from <br />      theÃ‚ NayanmarsÃ‚ too. <br />        <br />        SimplyÃ‚ put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />  knowledgeÃ‚ nor <br />      the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚ an <br />  AdhiÃ‚ Sankarar <br />      or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚ while remaining with in the <br />    faith.<br />        Ã‚ <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        ----- Original Message ----<br />        From: Vairam <br />        To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />        Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />        Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />ravana....<br />        <br />        <br />        Venkatesh,<br />        Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />  very <br />        very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />    also <br />        didnt oppose the different treatment&#40;different food system in <br />      school <br />        for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children&#41;. So every <br />leader <br />    has <br />        +ves and -ves.<br />        So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />  included <br />      is <br />        not a right argument here.<br />        Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />      society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />      different but <br />        still the motive should be appreciated.<br />        I hope we don&#39;t argue more on who should be included and who <br />      shouldn&#39;t <br />        be.<br />        <br />        Regards<br />        Vairam<br />        --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Thirumalai Vinjamoor <br />      Venkatesh <br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          Nanda, <br />          <br />          IÃƒâ€šÃ‚ am surprised that you sayÃƒâ€šÃ‚ EVR chose to fight, <br />instead <br />  of <br />        gettingÃƒâ€šÃ‚ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to <br />another <br />        religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒâ€šÃ‚ the faith and fight. <br />  He <br />      did <br />        become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />        hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />      all <br />        wereÃƒâ€šÃ‚ "practising"Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ Hindus, who very muchÃƒâ€šÃ‚ believed in <br />  God <br />      and fought <br />        with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />          <br />          In fact, whileÃƒâ€šÃ‚ some of EVR&#39;s argument <br />  wereÃƒâ€šÃ‚ veryÃƒâ€šÃ‚ valid <br />      regarding <br />        the irrationalÃƒâ€šÃ‚ and illogicalÃƒâ€šÃ‚ methods being followed, <br />      IÃƒâ€šÃ‚ think that <br />        he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒâ€šÃ‚ or tenets of <br />    Hinduism, <br />        before deciding to take onÃƒâ€šÃ‚ it. On the other hand, all those <br />    four <br />        above andÃƒâ€šÃ‚ thoseÃƒâ€šÃ‚ unsung heroes, understoodÃƒâ€šÃ‚ theÃƒâ€šÃ‚  <br />      scriptures than EVR <br />        and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />      withinÃƒâ€šÃ‚ the <br />        faith. <br />          <br />          So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we canÃƒâ€šÃ‚ give toEVR is that, <br />  he <br />      did <br />        not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />        should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel <br />    with <br />        true rationalism.<br />          <br />          And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />        then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />      Pillayar <br />        withÃƒâ€šÃ‚ chappals?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the <br />      discriminating <br />        Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />  Brahmins <br />      are <br />        notÃƒâ€šÃ‚ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />  toÃƒâ€šÃ‚ taking <br />      on <br />        theÃƒâ€šÃ‚ discriminating Brahmins, heÃƒâ€šÃ‚ and other fellow <br />atheists <br />      have taken <br />        upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />      cannot <br />        sustain the take. <br />          <br />          So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />  who <br />        fought for theÃƒâ€šÃ‚ social upliftment, while remaining within <br />the <br />      faith.<br />          Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh<br />          <br />          <br />          <br />          ----- Original Message ----<br />          From: Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />          To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />          Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 11:25:26 AM<br />          Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />      ravana....<br />          <br />          <br />          Please do add "Periyar" to this list.

Also on the right <br />to <br />        freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.<br />        <br />        I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more <br />than <br />        10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />    them, <br />      in <br />        TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. <br />It <br />        makes no sense to argue that EVR fought &#39;within&#39; or &#39;without&#39; <br />        boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />    faith. <br />      In <br />        fact Gandhi&#39;s own disagreement with EVR was this &#39;eye for an <br />  eye&#39; <br />        approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on <br />the <br />        other side. <br />        <br />        Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise <br />it <br />    with <br />        knowledge and responsibility is not something most people <br />know <br />    how <br />      to <br />        do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a&#39;la <br />Ramana <br />        Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor <br />did <br />  he <br />        profess hate or dislike of anybody else&#39;s faith.<br />        <br />        I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, <br />love <br />    to <br />        aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! <br />Also <br />        recommended is Paula Richman&#39;s Many Ramayanas &#40;available on <br />    Amazon&#41;.<br />        <br />        Malathi<br />        --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Thirumalai Vinjamoor <br />      Venkatesh <br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          Vairam,<br />          <br />          Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the <br />vocational <br />      based <br />        teaching system.ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš He too had faultered here and there. But <br />    remember, <br />        but for RajajiÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš and UVSÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš Iyer, the temple entry forÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš all <br />the <br />        oppressedÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš wouldÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš not have happened then. Fine that it <br />could <br />  have <br />        happened now.ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš But I am talking about the initiativestaken <br />by <br />    them.<br />          <br />          And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight <br />for <br />    the <br />        social cause. IÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš only say that he could not do it while <br />  remaining <br />        within the faith. AsÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš all of us know, his parentsÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš and <br />ancestors <br />      were <br />        all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš family of <br />    ardent <br />        believers, it is just his inabilityÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš &#40;yes, I would termÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš it <br />as <br />    his <br />        inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still <br />remaining a <br />        believer. There can be thousands ofÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš reasons given, toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš <br />explain, <br />    why <br />        he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />      didÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš not <br />        haveÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the <br />courage <br />    to <br />        fight from within.<br />          <br />          I amÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš even fine with the fact that heÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš became an atheist. <br />But <br />    my <br />        upfront question was why toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš garland the idols with <br />chappals, <br />    just <br />        toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš exhibit his atheistic inclinations.ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš And is this act, <br />not <br />      similar <br />        to whatÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš thechurches today. <br />When a <br />        Bajrang Dal doesÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš this, it is "communal", but if EVR does <br />it, it <br />    is <br />        Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />          <br />          This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />        Sunnambu".ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš &#40;PleaseÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš do not mistake me. I am not directing <br />this <br />        towardsÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš you, but the same government and the media houses <br />that <br />  I <br />        decried in my previous post&#41;<br />          <br />          Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in <br />the <br />        league ofÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš those who fought forÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš socialupliftment while <br />    remaining <br />        within the fight.ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš And remember, to comeÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš out of the faith <br />and <br />    fight <br />        against it is a very easy, butÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš think of the revolts that an <br />  Adhi <br />        Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš had to face whileÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš <br />fighting for <br />    the <br />        cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />        particular.ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš Needless toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš say that thisextends to everyone <br />        whoÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš socialÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš <br />equality <br />    while <br />        remaining within the faith. <br />          <br />          Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš orÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€ÂšNayanmars,ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš  <br />impress EVR. <br />        Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />        discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš <br />they <br />      mixed <br />        no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while <br />going <br />  to <br />        theÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually <br />  discriminate <br />    in <br />        theÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars <br />for <br />        this, whileÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš others can given ample references from <br />        theÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš NayanmarsÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš too. <br />          <br />          SimplyÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />    knowledgeÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš nor <br />        the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš an <br />    AdhiÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš Sankarar <br />        or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš while remaining with in <br />the <br />      faith.<br />          ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh<br />          <br />          <br />          <br />          ----- Original Message ----<br />          From: Vairam <br />          To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />          Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />          Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />  ravana....<br />          <br />          <br />          Venkatesh,<br />          Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />    very <br />          very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. <br />He <br />      also <br />          didnt oppose the different treatment&#40;different food system <br />in <br />        school <br />          for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children&#41;.

This is what I have been shouting in various other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fight within, are those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the original one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. Needless to say that our Politicians today are the standing examples of this Spineless Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too.<br /><br />And do we have anyone who fought the bias from within the faith itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting from Adhi Sankarar to Ramanuja to, until recently Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all. There are also many lesser known persons, who have fought a lot from within and I bet none of you will know even such persons existed.

All epic based vilains be it Ravana or<br />Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and<br />achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the<br />credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil<br />but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation<br />through surrender.<br /><br />What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about<br />Buddhism?

There can be thousands ofÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš reasons given,<br />toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš<br />  explain,<br />      why<br />          he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he<br />        didÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš not<br />          haveÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš either the knowledge of the true scriptures or<br />the<br />  courage<br />      to<br />          fight from within.<br />           <br />            I amÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš even fine with the fact that heÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš<br />became an atheist.<br />  But<br />      my<br />          upfront question was why toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš garland the idols with<br />  chappals,<br />      just<br />          toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš exhibit his atheistic inclinations.ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš <br />And is this act,<br />  not<br />        similar<br />          to whatÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš the<br />churches today.<br />  When a<br />          Bajrang Dal doesÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš this, it is "communal", but if EVR<br />does<br />  it, it<br />      is<br />          Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />           <br />            This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula<br />          Sunnambu".ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš &#40;PleaseÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Âš do not mistake me.

It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />    makes no sense to argue that EVR fought &#39;within&#39; or &#39;without&#39; <br />    boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />faith. <br />  In <br />    fact Gandhi&#39;s own disagreement with EVR was this &#39;eye for an eye&#39; <br />    approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />    other side. <br />    <br />    Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />with <br />    knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />how <br />  to <br />    do.

Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />  based <br />    teaching system.Ã‚Â He too had faultered here and there. But <br />remember, <br />    but for RajajiÃ‚Â and UVSÃ‚Â Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚Â all the <br />    oppressedÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â  not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />    happened now.Ã‚Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />them.<br />      <br />      And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />    social cause. IÃ‚Â only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />    within the faith. AsÃ‚Â all of us know, his parentsÃ‚Â and ancestors <br />were <br />    all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚Â family of <br />ardent <br />    believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as <br />his <br />    inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />    believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, <br />why <br />    he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />  didÃ‚Â not <br />    haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />to <br />    fight from within.<br />      <br />      I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist. But <br />my <br />    upfront question was why toÃ‚Â garland the idols with chappals, <br />just <br />    toÃ‚Â exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚Â  And is this act, not <br />similar <br />    to whatÃ‚Â a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚Â the churches today. When a <br />    Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚Â this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />is <br />    Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />      <br />      This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />    Sunnambu".Ã‚Â &#40;PleaseÃ‚Â  do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />    towardsÃ‚Â you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />    decried in my previous post&#41;<br />      <br />      Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />    league ofÃ‚Â those who fought forÃ‚Â social upliftment while <br />remaining <br />    within the fight.Ã‚Â And remember, to comeÃ‚Â out of the faith and <br />fight <br />    against it is a very easy, butÃ‚Â think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />    Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚Â had to face whileÃ‚Â fighting for <br />the <br />    cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />    particular.Ã‚Â Needless toÃ‚Â say that this extends to everyone <br />    whoÃ‚Â fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚Â socialÃ‚Â equality <br />while <br />    remaining within the faith. <br />      <br />      Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â Nayanmars,Ã‚Â  impress EVR. <br />    Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />    discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they <br />  mixed <br />    no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />    theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate <br />in <br />    theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />    this, whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from <br />    theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â  too. <br />      <br />      SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />knowledgeÃ‚Â nor <br />    the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an <br />AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar <br />    or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the <br />  faith.<br />      Ã‚Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      ----- Original Message ----<br />      From: Vairam <br />      To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />      Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />      Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships ravana....<br />      <br />      <br />      Venkatesh,<br />      Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />very <br />      very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.

Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />      religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â the faith and fight. <br />He <br />    did <br />      become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />      hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />    all <br />      wereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â "practising"Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â believed in <br />God <br />    and fought <br />      with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />        <br />        In fact, whileÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument <br />wereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â veryÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â valid <br />    regarding <br />      the irrationalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â and illogicalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â methods being followed, <br />    IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â think that <br />      he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â or tenets of <br />Hinduism, <br />      before deciding to take onÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â it.

A more appropriate stance perhaps would <br />be <br />    to <br />        fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.<br />        <br />        Malathi<br />        <br />        --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Vairam"  <br />  wrote: <br />         <br />          <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes">http://timesofindia.indiatimes</a><!-- m -->. com/India/ This_Kanpur_ <br />      village_worships _<br />          Ravana/articleshow/ 3577219.cms<br />          <br />          His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to <br />mark <br />        victory <br />          of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />      villagers<br />          <br />          of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring <br />  out <br />    a <br />          procession carrying his idol. <br />          <br />          "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of <br />Dravidian <br />    Gaud <br />          tribe and we consider him as our ancestor.
