'Conquerors of<br />Enemies,' i.e., Jinas). Salutation to all the Siddhas. By illustrious<br />Kharavela, the Aira (Aila), the Great King, the descendant of<br />Mahameghavahana, the increaser (of the glory) of the Cheti (Chedi)<br />dynasty, (endowed) with excellent and auspicious marks and features,<br />possessed of virtues which have reached (the ends of) the four quarters,<br />overlord of Kalinga,<br /><br />(L. 2) for fifteen years, with a body ruddy and handsome were played<br />youthsome sport; after that (by him who) had mastered (royal)<br />correspondence, currency, finance, civil and religious laws (and) who<br />had become well-versed in all (branches) of learning, for nine years<br />(the office of) Yuvaraja (heir apparent) was administered. Having<br />completed the twenty-fourth year, at that time, (he) who had been<br />prosperous (vardhamana) since his infancy (?) and who (was destined) to<br />have wide conquests as those of Vena,<br /><br />(L. 3) then in the state of manhood, obtains the imperial (maharajya)<br />coronation in the dynasty of Kalinga. As soon as he is anointed, in the<br />first (regnal) year (he) causes repairs of the gates, the walls and the<br />buildings (of the city), (which had been) damaged by storm; in the city<br />of Kalinga (he) causes the erection of the embankments of the lake<br />(called after) Khibira Rishi, (and) of (other) tanks and cisterns,<br />(also) the restoration of all the gardens (he) causes to be<br /><br />(L. 4) done at (the cost of) thirty-five-hundred-thousands, and (he)<br />gratifies the People. And in the second year (he), disregarding<br />Satakamini, despatches to the western regions an army strong in cavalry,<br />elephants, infantry (nara) and chariots (ratha) and by that army having<br />reached the Kanha-bemna, he throws the city of the Musikas into<br />consternation. Again in the third year,<br /><br />(L. 5) (he) versed in the science of the Gandharvas (i.e., music),<br />entertains the capital with the exhibition of dapa, dancing, singing and<br />instrumental music and by causing to be held festivities and assemblies<br />(samajas); similarly in the fourth year, 'the Abode of Vidyadharas'<br />built by the former Kalingan king(s), which had not been damaged before<br />.............................. with their coronets rendered meaningless,<br />with their helmets (?) (bilma) cut in twain (?), and with their<br />umbrellas and<br /><br />(L. 6) bhingaras cast away, deprived of their jewels (i.e., ratana, Skt.<br />ratna, precious objects) all the Rathikas and Bhojakas (he) causes to<br />bow down at his feet. Now in the fifth year he brings into the capital<br />from the road of Tansauliya the canal excavated in the year one<br />hundred-and-three of King Nanda ................... .........

Thanks.<br />I was wondering that if Kundavai was such a powerful lady, why was she<br />married to Vandhiya thevan instead of some powerful king? Husband of a<br />powerful lady like Kundavai must have been talked more of.. Why has<br />Vanthiya thevan always been a low profile character? <br /><br />"Our beloved rashtrakuta hero vandhiyathevan had little to do with this<br />lady who played complex political games and should have resorted to<br />peaceful life probably with other wives(!)." <br /><br />If they didn't have much in common, what could have motivated such a<br />relationship? <br /><br />Was this Kundavai's plan of staying in the kingdom and thereby not<br />renouncing her rights in the kingdom? Or was Vandhiya thevan more<br />powerful than he has been portrayed? <br /><br />Also want to know if there's a tomb for Rajaraja. <br /><br /><br /><br />"Gokul.S" <br />wrote:<br />REPOSTING AN EARLIER MESSAGE FOR NEW MEMBERS:<br /><br />"Vallavaraiyar Vandhiyathevar Pirattiyar Aazhvar Parantakan Kundavai <br />Pirattiyar"<br /><br />This is how one of the most powerful ladies of the ancient chola <br />kingdom gets her introduction in the famous tanjore temple inscriptions.<br /><br />The very name deserves detailed analysis.<br /><br />Vallavaraiyan vandhiyathevan has been referred to in inscriptions as <br />and ONLY AS the husband of Kundavai. i am atleast unaware of a single <br />inscription which talks exclusively about VDevan. If even people like <br />paarthivendravarman were able to provide a significant no of grants, <br />why this hero is not finding an exclusive place in the world of <br />Tamilnadu temple inscriptions ? Probably we may never know.<br /><br />Pirattiyar. Most of the royal ladies are referred to as the wives of so <br />and so. "Udaiyar Raajaraja devarin nampiraatiyar dandhi sakthi <br />vitankiyar" is a common usage.<br /><br />Aazhvar : Ah ! This is probably the most interesting word in the whole <br />phrase. Azhvar is a term only used to signift vaishnavaite saints who <br />lived 2 to 3 centuries before cholas. Why this lady was given such a <br />title ?<br />NO OTHER ROYAL LADY OR MALE - EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER KUNDAVAI WAS EVER <br />AWARDED SUCH A TITLE. So what does this title really mean ? Is it a <br />title given with a religious sense ? May not be - because she was a <br />truely royal lady with no specific attachment to a given religion. She <br />built 4 and only 4 temples : One saivaite, One vaishnavite (Sundarach <br />chozha vinnagarm) one buddhist and one jain (Sundarach chozhap <br />perumpalli) - probably all the 4 in the name of her father.<br /><br />There was one more kundavai in the chola clan before this current <br />kundavai - she was called "veeman kundavai" I think a rashtrakuta <br />princess and consort of arinjaya.<br /><br />In order to distinguish herself from her senior, our kundavai called <br />herself "paraantakan kundavai" - tagging her most beloved father's name <br />with her name. The love between daughter and king as portrayed in <br />Ponniyin selvan is no fiction : she builds sundarach chozha vinnagaram, <br />sundarach chozha vinnagara aadhura saalai (hospital) and even donates <br />idols of her parents to periya koil temple.<br /><br />What was her relationship to arulmozhi or raajaraja ? Did rajaraja <br />really have the kind of relationship as portrayed in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> ?<br /><br />Answer is a reasonable yes.<br /><br />The VERY FIRST INSCRIPTION IN TANJORE TEMPLE that talks about the royal <br />order in which the king orders to record donations of each and every <br />indivitual to periya koil begins this :<br /><br />"Naam kuduththanavum nam akkan kuduthanavum nam pendugal <br />kuduththanavum..."<br /><br />See the beloved feeling of raajaraja - he does not call her "Vdevar <br />pirattiyar etc. - Straight away he calles her "akkan"<br /><br />And he places her name just next to him - even above his peendugal or <br />wives - even above the royal consort dandhi sakthi vitanki<br /><br />That tells the power this lady enjoyed in the kingdom - she gives <br />enormous offerings in gold to periyakoil - establishing her financial <br />strength.<br /><br />One interesting fact :<br /><br />The major contributions of periyakoil were carefully monitored. Not all <br />could give anything even though the could offord. When it was rajaraja <br />who presents the main utsava idol "Dakshinameeru vitankarana <br />aadavallar" it is kundavai who is permitted to present a "Umadevi" or <br />consort to this vigraha.<br /><br />Just by analyzing who has made which contribution, one is able to <br />realize the order of power in rajaraja's time.<br /><br />What was the reason behind rajaraja's extreme love and affecton for his <br />sister ? Was it a natural flow or were there significant reasons<br /><br />We will analyze...<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />There is an interesting inscription of Rajaraja in Thirukkovilur. I<br />even wrote a story called "Kapilan" in varalaaru.com based on this<br />inscription.<br />The inscription is an agavarpaa - tamil poem - unlike most<br />inscriptions. It introduces the fame of thirukkovilur by narrating 2<br />incidents :<br />* One : The fact that sangam poet kapilan entered fire standing in a<br />rock called Kapilak kaal. Today there is a temple on this big rock<br />boulder<br />* Two : The fact that Vaanavan maadevi - wife of sundara chozha - who<br />was from thirukkovilur malayaman clan - entered funeral pyre or sati<br />here.<br />It was almost customary and normal to enter sati with husband in those<br />days. I am really unable to imagine the thoughts or emotions of a 10th<br />century mind that inspired this kind of actions. In this reg it is<br />worthwhile to analyze why sembiyan mahadeviyar did not commit sati ?<br />Was she too young to do that ? Was it a major inspiration for her<br />religious and pious life aftermath ? <br />AND WAS THERE ANY SATI AT ALL WITH RAJARAJA AND RAJENDRA ?<br />OK coming back to inscription.<br />It says :<br />"...raajarajan ennum puliyai payandha pon maan..<br />...surandha mulaip paal magavodu piriyath thaiyal...."<br />The second line is very touching. It says there was a child which was<br />still receiving milk from her and she had to separate such a small<br />child in order to unite with her deceased husband.<br />So far no proper explanation has been given to who this child really<br />was or whether it is just a poetic imagination. That this is an<br />imagination - I am fully setting it aside. I refuse to believe it is<br />just a poet's imagination. No poet will include such a line that too<br />in a rajaraja period inscription.<br />We all know that aditya and kundavai were elder than arumozhi. Now the<br />question is - what was the age of all the three children when vaanavan<br />madevi entered funeral pyre ? We do not know. And who is the baby<br />referred by the song ? we do not know.<br />So, could it be that arulmozhi was small when sundara died ? Was it<br />because of this fact that kundavai had to bring up arulmozhi and that<br />explains the love of brother towords his sister ?<br />It may not be, if we were to take thiruvaalangadu inscriptions into<br />consideration. it says people wanted arulmozhi to be crowned and<br />inspite of that he gave up throne to uttama.<br />So arulmozhi was of reasonable age when sundara died and the question<br />of next king came to picture. So this is in direct contradiction to<br />the inscription poem we are talking about.<br />Who is this child ? we may not be able to answer with the available<br />facts right now. More research is required.<br />Whatever may be the fact, Kundavai - arulmozhi affection was as solid<br />and true as a rock. No questions. To rajaraja she was above every<br />other person in his life. Clearly attested by periyakoil inscriptions.<br />Kundavai should have shaped many of his ambitions, plans etc. And the<br />important thing is she was alive and well when periyakoil was<br />completed. If we were to assume (ofcourse with the basis that he came<br />to power in early 30s) that rajaraja was in his 50s when he built the<br />temple, kundavai would have been in her early 60s. Imagine this old<br />lady accompanying the great king....<br />Did any of you try to identify this lady in the chola painting that<br />shows the consecration of big temple ?<br />Let us cover other aspects of kundavai.<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Kundavai seems to have built 4 temples - one saivaite katrali, one<br />vinnagaram (sundara chozha vinnagaram I think), one jainap perumpalli<br />(on thirumalai vaiyavoor if I am not wrong) and one baudhdha perumpalli<br />I don't have accurate inscriptional information to support above - but<br />I remember that this is what she constructed. Members can support with<br />what they have read<br />This immediately calls for our attention.<br />First : Kundavai wanted to position herself as a person neutral to all<br />religious sects. He was not like sembiyan mahadevi or lokamadevi who<br />had no hesitation in showing their saivaite inclinations. There was<br />some definite need for her to position herself this way.<br />Second : Link it with what exactly she was doing during rajaraja's<br />reign. She commands supreme respect from emperor, gives great<br />nivanthams to big temple (means she had considetable financial<br />strength) - but WHAT WAS SHE DOING ON DAY TO DAY BASIS ? Was she a<br />kind of political consultant to Rajaraja ? Did she sit in important<br />meetings ? Did rajaraja consult her on important decisions ?<br />Inscriptions say she was maintaining adhuula saala (hospital) that's<br />all - but certainly she was doing more than this. Combine her role in<br />politics with her neutral stand on religions - be it large group or<br />small.<br />Conclusion is evident. While rajaraja positioned himself as a great<br />devotee of lord shiva with soft corners to other religions, there was<br />a need for someone in the "top" who could position themselves as a<br />neutral body whom other religious groups will trust. In an empire as<br />big as chola's during rajaraja's time, religious disturbance is the<br />last thing emperor would have preferred. So, the solution ? Kundavai<br />positions herself like this so that every other religious group comes<br />to her with all their problems<br />We can safely state that the big aanaimangalam grants were bestowed at<br />the influence of kundavai or atleast she should have had a role in it.<br />Kundavai donated Uma Bhattaragiyar to big temple and also established<br />the images of Parantaka chola and vaanavan mahadevi - her parents - in<br />periyakoil. She leaves nivanthams to support this worship.<br />Our beloved rashtrakuta hero vandhiyathevan had little to do with this<br />lady who played complex political games and should have resorted to<br />peaceful life probably with other wives(!).<br />So far we have not found a pallipadai for kundavai. That seems to be<br />strange. And nobody seems to donate her idol for worship in periyakoil<br />though she herself donates the images of her father and mother. Not<br />much donations to periyakoil after rajaraja's time - that is a<br />different topic altogether...<br />Was it lost over a period of time ? Is it still lying in one of the<br />unpublished inscriptions of mysore ? Or...<br />Did she live to see the death of rajaraja ? was there nobody after<br />rajaraja who could built a pallipadai for her ?<br />Or did she not take the siva deeksha which would have enabled the<br />heirs to build a temple around her remains ?<br />We can only guess.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Building a website is a piece of cake. <br />Yahoo!
