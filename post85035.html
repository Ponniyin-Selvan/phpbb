			<div class="content">A Brief History of Hindu Temples<br /><br />How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess. <br />Temples do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age. <br /><br />The practice of preparing images of the deities mentioned in the <br />Vedic mantras might have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic <br />period. The view that the yagasala of the Vedic period gradually got <br />metamorphosed into temples by the epic period owing to the influence <br />of the cults of devotion is widely accepted.<br /><br />The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like timber <br />and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of the stone or built with <br />bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture <br />and sculpture belong to a still later period.<br /><br />Considering the vast size of this country, is is remarkable that the <br />building of temple has progressed more or less on a set pattern. This <br />is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, its meaning <br />and significance, which will be explained later.<br /><br />In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did appear, <br />gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple <br />architecture. Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the <br />northern and the southern styles. <br /><br />The northern style, technically called nagara, is distinguished by <br />the curvilinear towers. <br /><br />The southern style, known as the dravida, has its towers in the form <br />of truncated pyramids. A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes <br />added, which combines in itself both these styles.<br /><br />The earliest temples in north and central India which have withstood <br />the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 A. D. <br />Mention may be meda of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near Jabbalpur <br />in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna (Rajasthan) <br />and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).<br /><br />Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are found in <br />Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravidan school of <br />architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest <br />Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural. <br /><br />The later rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period 500-800 <br />A.D. were mostly Brahmanical or Jain, patronised by three great <br />ruling dynasties of the south, namely the Pallavas of Kanchi in the <br />east, the Calukyas of Badami in the 8th century A.D, the Rastrakutas <br />of Malkhed came to power and they made great contributions to the <br />development of south Indian temple architecture. The Kailasanatha <br />temple at Ellora belongs to this period.<br /><br />In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aihole and Pattadakal group of <br />temples (5th to 7th centuries) show early attempts to evolve an <br />acceptable regional style based on tradition. <br /><br />Among the better known early structural temples at Aihole are the <br />Huchimalligudi and Durga temples as also the Ladkhan temple, all <br />assigned to the period 450-650 A.D. Equally important are the temples <br />of Kasinatha, Papanatha, Sangamesvara, Virupaksa and others in <br />Pattadakal near Aihole as also the Svargabrahma temple at Alampur <br />(Andhra Pradesh). <br /><br />It is in some of these temples, built by the later Calukyas, that we <br />come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and the <br />southern modes.<br /><br />There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural <br />styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive <br />text called the Vastu Sastra has its sources in the Sutras, Puranas <br />and Agamas besides Tantric literature and the Brhat Samhita. <br /><br />But all of them are agreed that basically styles can be divided into <br />nagara, dravida and vesara. They employ respectively the square, <br />octagon and the apse or circle in their plan. In its later evolution <br />when the vesara style adopted the square for the sanctum. The <br />circular or stellar plan was retained for the vimana. <br /><br />These three styles do not pertain strictly to three different regions <br />but as indicating only the temple groups. The vesara, for instance, <br />which came to pravail mostly in western Deccan and south Karnataka <br />was a derivation from the apsidal chapels of the early Buddhist <br />period which the Brahmanical faith adopted and vastly improved. In <br />its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian as it is west <br />Deccanese. <br /><br />Similarly among the 6th Â– 7th century shrines of Aihole and <br />Pattadakal we find evidance of nagara style in the prasadas or <br />vimanas. <br /><br />The dravida or Tamilian style cecame very popular throughout south <br />India only from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the prasada or <br />vimana of the nagara style rises vertically from its base in a <br />curvilinear form, that of the dravida rises like a stepped pyramid, <br />tier upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan Upper <br />India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.<br /><br /><br />During the next thousand years (from600 to 1600 A.D.) there was a <br />phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and <br />quality. <br /><br />The first in the series of southern or dravidian architecture was <br />initiated by the Pallavas (600-900A.D.) The rock-cut temples at <br />Mahabalipuram (of the `ratha' type) and the structural temples like <br />the shore temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntha <br />Perumal temples in Kancheepuram (700-800 A.D.) are the best <br />representatives of the Pallava style. <br /><br />The Pallavas laid the foundations of the dravidian school which <br />blossomed to its full extent during the Colas, the Pandyas, the <br />Vijayanagar kings and the Nayaks. <br /><br />The temples, now built of stone, became bigger, more complex and <br />ornate with sculptures. Dravidian architecture reached its glory <br />during the Chola period (900-1200 A.D.) by becoming more imposing in <br />size and endowed with happy proportions. <br /><br />Among the most beautiful of the Chola temples is the Brhadisvara <br />temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre high vimana, the tallest of its <br />kind. The later Pandyans who succeeded the Cholas improved on the <br />Cholas by introducing elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural <br />images, many-pillared halls, new annexes to the shrine and towers <br />(gopurams) on the gateways. <br /><br />The mighty temple complexes of Madurai and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu <br />set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (1350-1565 A.D.) who <br />followed the dravidian tradition. The Pampapati and Vitthala temples <br />in Hampi are standing examples of this period. The Nayaks of Madurai <br />who succeeded the Vijayanagar kings (1600-1750 A.D.) made the <br />dravidian temple complex even more elaborate by making the gopurams <br />very tall and ornate and adding pillared corridors within the temple <br />long compound.<br /><br />Contemporaneous with the Cholas (1100-1300A.D.), the Hoysalas who <br />ruled the Kannada country improved on the Calukyan style by building <br />extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karnataka noted for the <br />sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lathe-turned pillars and <br />fully sculptured vimanas. Among the most famous of these temples are <br />the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanathapura in south Karnataka, <br />which are classified under the vesara style.<br /><br /><br />In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture <br />took place in Orissa (750-1250 A.D.) and Central India (950-1050 <br />A.D.) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th Century A.D.) and Gujarat <br />(11th-13th Century A.D.). <br /><br />The temples of Lingaraja (Bhubaneshwar), Jagannatha (Puri) and Surya <br />(Konarak) represent the Orissan style. The temple at Khajuraho built <br />by the Chandellas, the Surya temple at Modhera (Gujarat0 and other <br />temple at Mt. Abu built by the Solankis have their own distinct <br />features in Central indian architecture. Bengal with its temples <br />built in bricks and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples <br />having peculiar roof structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the <br />region, developed their own localised special styles.<br /><br />Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu temples outside <br />India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest of <br />such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the Siva temples <br />at Dieng and (idong Songo built by the kings of Sailendra dynasty <br />(8th-9th century A.D.). <br /><br />The group of temples of Lara Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th <br />century A.D.), is a magnificent example of Hindu temple architecture. <br />Other temples worth mentioning are: the temple complex at Panataran <br />(java) built by the kings of Majapahit dynasty (14th century A.D.), <br />the rock-cut temple facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century <br />A.D.), the 'mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century A.D.), the <br />Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century <br />A.D.)., the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century A.D.) and <br />the celebrated Angkor vat complex (12th century A.D.) built by Surya <br />varman II.</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Member<br /><br />You have made a very good account on evolution of Temple architecture in<br />the Indian subcontinent. However, one can see the transformation of dynastical style of South indian temples at the following archaeological sites<br /><br />namely 1. Sreenivasanallur, 2.Vijayalaya choleeswaram at Narthamalai.<br /><br />GSK<br /><br />"s.balasubramani"  wrote:<br />A Brief History of Hindu Temples<br /><br />How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess.<br />Temples do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age.<br /><br />The practice of preparing images of the deities mentioned in the<br />Vedic mantras might have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic<br />period. The view that the yagasala of the Vedic period gradually got<br />metamorphosed into temples by the epic period owing to the influence<br />of the cults of devotion is widely accepted.<br /><br />The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like timber<br />and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of the stone or built with<br />bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture<br />and sculpture belong to a still later period.<br /><br />Considering the vast size of this country, is is remarkable that the<br />building of temple has progressed more or less on a set pattern. This<br />is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, its meaning<br />and significance, which will be explained later.<br /><br />In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did appear,<br />gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple<br />architecture. Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the<br />northern and the southern styles.<br /><br />The northern style, technically called nagara, is distinguished by<br />the curvilinear towers.<br /><br />The southern style, known as the dravida, has its towers in the form<br />of truncated pyramids. A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes<br />added, which combines in itself both these styles.<br /><br />The earliest temples in north and central India which have withstood<br />the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 A. D.<br />Mention may be meda of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near Jabbalpur<br />in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna (Rajasthan)<br />and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).<br /><br />Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are found in<br />Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravidan school of<br />architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest<br />Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural.<br /><br />The later rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period 500-800<br />A.D. were mostly Brahmanical or Jain, patronised by three great<br />ruling dynasties of the south, namely the Pallavas of Kanchi in the<br />east, the Calukyas of Badami in the 8th century A.D, the Rastrakutas<br />of Malkhed came to power and they made great contributions to the<br />development of south Indian temple architecture. The Kailasanatha<br />temple at Ellora belongs to this period.<br /><br />In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aihole and Pattadakal group of<br />temples (5th to 7th centuries) show early attempts to evolve an<br />acceptable regional style based on tradition.<br /><br />Among the better known early structural temples at Aihole are the<br />Huchimalligudi and Durga temples as also the Ladkhan temple, all<br />assigned to the period 450-650 A.D. Equally important are the temples<br />of Kasinatha, Papanatha, Sangamesvara, Virupaksa and others in<br />Pattadakal near Aihole as also the Svargabrahma temple at Alampur<br />(Andhra Pradesh).<br /><br />It is in some of these temples, built by the later Calukyas, that we<br />come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and the<br />southern modes.<br /><br />There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural<br />styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive<br />text called the Vastu Sastra has its sources in the Sutras, Puranas<br />and Agamas besides Tantric literature and the Brhat Samhita.<br /><br />But all of them are agreed that basically styles can be divided into<br />nagara, dravida and vesara. They employ respectively the square,<br />octagon and the apse or circle in their plan. In its later evolution<br />when the vesara style adopted the square for the sanctum. The<br />circular or stellar plan was retained for the vimana.<br /><br />These three styles do not pertain strictly to three different regions<br />but as indicating only the temple groups. The vesara, for instance,<br />which came to pravail mostly in western Deccan and south Karnataka<br />was a derivation from the apsidal chapels of the early Buddhist<br />period which the Brahmanical faith adopted and vastly improved. In<br />its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian as it is west<br />Deccanese.<br /><br />Similarly among the 6th ? 7th century shrines of Aihole and<br />Pattadakal we find evidance of nagara style in the prasadas or<br />vimanas.<br /><br />The dravida or Tamilian style cecame very popular throughout south<br />India only from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the prasada or<br />vimana of the nagara style rises vertically from its base in a<br />curvilinear form, that of the dravida rises like a stepped pyramid,<br />tier upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan Upper<br />India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.<br /><br />During the next thousand years (from600 to 1600 A.D.) there was a<br />phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and<br />quality.<br /><br />The first in the series of southern or dravidian architecture was<br />initiated by the Pallavas (600-900A.D.) The rock-cut temples at<br />Mahabalipuram (of the `ratha' type) and the structural temples like<br />the shore temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntha<br />Perumal temples in Kancheepuram (700-800 A.D.) are the best<br />representatives of the Pallava style.<br /><br />The Pallavas laid the foundations of the dravidian school which<br />blossomed to its full extent during the Colas, the Pandyas, the<br />Vijayanagar kings and the Nayaks.<br /><br />The temples, now built of stone, became bigger, more complex and<br />ornate with sculptures. Dravidian architecture reached its glory<br />during the Chola period (900-1200 A.D.) by becoming more imposing in<br />size and endowed with happy proportions.<br /><br />Among the most beautiful of the Chola temples is the Brhadisvara<br />temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre high vimana, the tallest of its<br />kind. The later Pandyans who succeeded the Cholas improved on the<br />Cholas by introducing elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural<br />images, many-pillared halls, new annexes to the shrine and towers<br />(gopurams) on the gateways.<br /><br />The mighty temple complexes of Madurai and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu<br />set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (1350-1565 A.D.) who<br />followed the dravidian tradition. The Pampapati and Vitthala temples<br />in Hampi are standing examples of this period. The Nayaks of Madurai<br />who succeeded the Vijayanagar kings (1600-1750 A.D.) made the<br />dravidian temple complex even more elaborate by making the gopurams<br />very tall and ornate and adding pillared corridors within the temple<br />long compound.<br /><br />Contemporaneous with the Cholas (1100-1300A.D.), the Hoysalas who<br />ruled the Kannada country improved on the Calukyan style by building<br />extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karnataka noted for the<br />sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lathe-turned pillars and<br />fully sculptured vimanas. Among the most famous of these temples are<br />the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanathapura in south Karnataka,<br />which are classified under the vesara style.<br /><br />In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture<br />took place in Orissa (750-1250 A.D.) and Central India (950-1050<br />A.D.) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th Century A.D.) and Gujarat<br />(11th-13th Century A.D.).<br /><br />The temples of Lingaraja (Bhubaneshwar), Jagannatha (Puri) and Surya<br />(Konarak) represent the Orissan style. The temple at Khajuraho built<br />by the Chandellas, the Surya temple at Modhera (Gujarat0 and other<br />temple at Mt. Abu built by the Solankis have their own distinct<br />features in Central indian architecture. Bengal with its temples<br />built in bricks and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples<br />having peculiar roof structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the<br />region, developed their own localised special styles.<br /><br />Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu temples outside<br />India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest of<br />such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the Siva temples<br />at Dieng and (idong Songo built by the kings of Sailendra dynasty<br />(8th-9th century A.D.).<br /><br />The group of temples of Lara Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th<br />century A.D.), is a magnificent example of Hindu temple architecture.<br />Other temples worth mentioning are: the temple complex at Panataran<br />(java) built by the kings of Majapahit dynasty (14th century A.D.),<br />the rock-cut temple facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century<br />A.D.), the 'mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century A.D.), the<br />Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century<br />A.D.)., the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century A.D.) and<br />the celebrated Angkor vat complex (12th century A.D.) built by Surya<br />varman II.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Find out what India is talking about on Yahoo!
