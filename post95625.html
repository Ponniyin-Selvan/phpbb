So there is no proof that ravidasan and <br />gang held high posts in uttama rule ( if anyone does have any such - <br />please do let me know), they could have run away after comitting the <br />crime, justice was not delayed for 16 years.<br /><br />some more points for discussion - <br /><br />Ravidasan was a high officer during sundara time. anyone controdicting <br />this<br /><br />his close relative was a high officer in pandya kingdom same time<br /><br />Both of them were trained in the chera academy ( kandhalur salai)<br /><br />they both plot to assasinate <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>as his above unfair treatment of a <br />fallen foe ( exhibiting his head on a pole)<br /><br />due to this reason <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s first assignment or claim to fame is <br />destruction of kandalur salai...<br /><br /><br />vj</div>

			<div class="content">Many people would agree, but in the scene which Aditya karikalan remembers from his memory, Nandhini falls in front of Veera pandiyan's and pleads with him to spare her lover(Veera Pandiya). Kalki never tries to prove or state vehemently, that this Veera Pandiyan is the same the one who impregnates Mandakini ammaiyar. So sense of timeline loss is evident here and as alwaysyou have five pandiyas ruling from the pandiya kingdom always. <br /><br />Another question when it comes to five brothers ruling the pandiya kingdom and the resultant thayathi/pangali fighting? What is the selection process of the pandiya kings?
