			<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />I agree on your thoughts for the 'current' time line of a few thousand years of evolution. As we begin to march backwards we are still exploring the crust of earth to find out various truths on Man and his presence, we have been able to recognize man's presence during the dinosaur era and so on. Again, this is a smaller time line compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize the majority of evolution. From what I read, it looks like there are theories based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the closest to come on its time frame.<br />Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great mystery and unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as explained: It is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground level during the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds of archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden terrains of himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth has been close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the place where the keys have been lost is not the same where there is light to search.<br />Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and massive houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story to all, but how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc barring the large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and Pallavas. Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, the foot prints of millions of years can be burried into mother earth for good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, the ocean is a whole different story.<br />Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a shortened sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under water, the 1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had done so into a place ( older time was a mountain I believe) called 'Uthira Meru - today's uthiramerur' these places forming the great deccan plateau were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I believe.<br />Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi scientific model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks folks!<br />Ravi<br />Muthu Prakash Ravindran  wrote: Hi<br /><br />I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />1.

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />There is no evidence of man living during the dinosaur<br />era. Modern humans ( Homo Sapiens ) evolved about<br />250,000 years ago. Before that were all apes and did<br />not have the physical structure to support<br />civilization.<br /><br />Dinosaurs lived until the late Cretaceous era which is<br />about 65 million years ago.<br /><br />We can track the primates to about 85 million years<br />ago and the oldest primates shared a common ancestor (<br />probably a bat! ) that lived in the Cretaceous era..<br /><br />Tobo catastrophe theory postulates that a massic<br />volcanoic explosion in Indonesia roughly about 70 to<br />75 thousand years put a massive pressure on the living<br />world and possibly reduced the hominids to Homo<br />Sapiens, Homo Neanderthals and Homo Floresiensis and<br />possibly trigerred an ice age. The population of Homo<br />Sapiens world wide might have been reduced to a mere<br />10,000 or so. Modern genetic studies reveal that the<br />present day humans were evolved from a group of about<br />1000 - 10,000 individuals! These human ancestors<br />migrated out of Africa, once the environment became<br />stable and populated the entire world. The Tobo<br />catostrophe is backed up by the genetic and geographic<br />data.<br /><br />The Homo Neanderthals became extinct about 30,000<br />years ago and the Homo Floresiensis became extinct<br />about 12,000 years ago.<br /><br />Dr. Loganathan has identified reminiscence of ancient<br />Sumerian language in sangam Tamil. This is highly<br />probable due to the human migration pattern. The<br />Sumerians were temple centric and had a culture that<br />revered education, literature and writing. The notion<br />of a sangam might have been a faint rememberence of<br />the Sumerian days.<br /><br />While there is no scientific evidence of the Tamils in<br />the lemuria continent, there is perhaps linguistic<br />evidence of Tamil-Sumerian connections!<br /><br />More research needed!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />--- ravi venu  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br /> <br />  I agree on your thoughts for the &#39;current&#39; time line<br />  of a few thousand years of evolution.

			<div class="content">From an evolutionist point of view - what you can deem as concrete evidence is what that meets the naked eye. I am not an evolutionist so there is no fantasy. A few decades ago Stem cell research and multiple personality syndromes were figment of imagination. The proof may not be as easy to figure out as it looks via science, we are new borns when it comes to knowledge. The answers to many are not available in plain focussed science, only a mixture of data on science and religion has a chance to figure out the truth.

Dhanushkodi is another example. There is more to be discovered and having an open mind to theories may find a derivative to our past.<br /><br />On Uthiramerur, how ever funny it may seem, as a humble learner, I would like to know of any other reason on its name.<br /><br />We need answers for questions which science by its own takes thousands of years to figure out.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Ravi<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R  wrote: Let me make one thing clear. I am not going to advocate any POV on<br />the religious doctrines or what not. Also personal beliefs do not<br />count as theories (like fossils being lost during the emergence of<br />Himalayas) unless backed by fine arguments. I look at it from a guy<br />who has done his <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of scientific reading and much of what I read<br />here is not quasi-science but pseudo-science.<br /><br />Lets deconstruct the points.<br />1. 'Current timeline' and 'theorizing evolution'. I dont understand<br />this current timeline <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>.

Or the<br />timeline as we understand? And evolution is not a few thousand years<br />of process but rather is going on for millions of years. Even human<br />evolution runs into millions of years. So not sure where<br />the 'thousands' crept in. Genographic study is a totally different<br />thing from evolution in that it attempts to map the migration of<br />humans across globe over the last 10-20 thousand years through DNA<br />mapping. This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to prove<br />that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a common DNA.<br />Same goes for the Earth's crust<br />(<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/index.php">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/str ... /index.php</a><!-- m -->).<br />There has been a lot of geological research that has been done over<br />the years from Charles Lyell's times(who was an inspiration for<br />Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory) and ofcourse,<br />geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

Ofcourse, the<br />footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what the<br />archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that there is<br />still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to know a<br />lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely say that<br />we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the depths<br />of Indian ocean especially lemuria.

			<div class="content">Let me make one thing clear. I am not going to advocate any POV on <br />the religious doctrines or what not. Also personal beliefs do not <br />count as theories (like fossils being lost during the emergence of <br />Himalayas) unless backed by fine arguments. I look at it from a guy <br />who has done his <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of scientific reading and much of what I read <br />here is not quasi-science but pseudo-science.<br /><br />Lets deconstruct the points.<br />1. 'Current timeline' and 'theorizing evolution'. I dont understand <br />this current timeline <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. Are we talking about a parallel timeline <br />as explained by the string theories? (Three hours of full dose <br />available here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="athttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/">athttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/</a><!-- m -->). Or the <br />timeline as we understand? And evolution is not a few thousand years <br />of process but rather is going on for millions of years. Even human <br />evolution runs into millions of years. So not sure where <br />the 'thousands' crept in. Genographic study is a totally different <br />thing from evolution in that it attempts to map the migration of <br />humans across globe over the last 10-20 thousand years through DNA <br />mapping. This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to prove <br />that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a common DNA. <br />Same goes for the Earth's crust <br />(<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/index.php">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/str ... /index.php</a><!-- m -->). <br />There has been a lot of geological research that has been done over <br />the years from Charles Lyell's times(who was an inspiration for <br />Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory) and ofcourse, <br />geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

Where is the proof? if you <br />talking about the Paluxy river evidence, please read through <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy.htmlfor">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy.htmlfor</a><!-- m --> more information on <br />that. It is one thing to come up with hypothesis and another to talk <br />it up like its fact. Sorry Venkatesh, Flintstones are still a <br />fantasy only.<br />3. Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in your mail <br />itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. Ofcourse, the <br />footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what the <br />archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that there is <br />still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to know a <br />lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely say that <br />we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the depths <br />of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the reasoning <br />for 'Uthiramerur' is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I've read in this group so far <br />and so I chose to ignore it. <br />I dont mind things being touted as based on religious observations <br />or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency to mix <br />science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked as <br />factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist movement in US <br />and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont think it is <br />necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which are clearly <br />there to serve our vanities and nothing more. <br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence <br />  during the dinosaur era and so on. <br />  <br />  Hi Venu<br />  is that so.?

			<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />The most widely accepted view among current anthropologists is that <br />Homo sapiens originated in the African savanna around 200,000 years <br />ago, descending from Homo erectus, had colonized Eurasia and Oceania <br />before 40,000 years, and finally colonized the Americas approximately <br />10,000 years ago.<br />They displaced Homo neanderthalensis and other species descended <br />from Homo erectus (which had colonized Eurasia as early as 2 million <br />years ago) through more successful reproduction and competition for <br />resources.<br />The earliest humans were hunter-gatherers, a lifestyle well-suited to <br />the savanna. They generally lived in small, nomadic groups. <br /><br />Around 10,000 years ago, the advent of agriculture prompted the <br />Neolithic Revolution. Access to a stable food source led to the <br />formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of <br />animals, and the use of metal tools. Agriculture also encouraged <br />trade and cooperation, leading to complex societies. Villages <br />developed into thriving civilizations in regions such as the Middle <br />East's Fertile Crescent.<br />Around 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in <br />Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus Valley.<br /><br />so we are talking about ten thousand years as the starting point for <br />modern man.<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Venkateswaran K <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi,<br />  <br />  There is no evidence of man living during the dinosaur<br />  era.

The population of Homo<br />  Sapiens world wide might have been reduced to a mere<br />  10,000 or so. Modern genetic studies reveal that the<br />  present day humans were evolved from a group of about<br />  1000 - 10,000 individuals!

			<div class="content">I am not an evolutionaist but a guy who likes to look at things <br />unbiased and with a scientific perspective. And of course, as I said <br />earlier, I am not going to get into the meta-physical world and <br />derive facts for me.<br />Science operates in two modes. One is theory and other is <br />experiment. While the theory is proposed, it has to be proven by <br />experiment. While the General theory of Relativity talked about the <br />gravitaion, only the actual observation of the trasit of venus <br />proved it. Scientific method by itself is rigourous, self-corrective <br />and critique-driven. That is why it appeals to me. <br />What you call fantasy is something that was proposed as a theory and <br />years of observation of the phenomenon and experiments have provided <br />proof to the fact. Evolutionary theory, as explained by Darwin, has <br />changed a lot today, although the basis remains the same, and has <br />evolved itself through the self-correcting process of experiments <br />and observations. The only POV acceptable here is the relentless <br />pursuit of truth however hard-hitting it may be.<br />On the other hand, the concept of lemuria is often confused with the <br />continental plates theory and there is not one iota of proof and <br />what we have is a theory propagated by the sangam poets about <br />kingdoms thousands of years old and by dravidian politicians who <br />used it in the 50's and 60's as a tool to drive forth the Tamil <br />nationalism. No proofs. In fact, no one is interested in proof as it <br />may not validate their POV. Even today, there is a lot of confusion <br />on what is in and what is out of this theory. In fact, I even saw a <br />map of the lemuria with the cities and mountains mapped out. Who is <br />the geographer who mapped it? Can you formulate a decent theory of <br />Lemuria, some of which can be proved beyond doubt? We talk <br />about 'Pahruli' river, mt.Meru and a great city called ThenMadurai <br />with a decent amount of population submerged in he oceans between <br />Cape Kumari and Madagaskar and Java. But where is a theory which <br />says this is what Lemuria is and ready to correct itself when <br />evidence is found? The resistance to scientific approach is usual in <br />cases of dogma in relation to religion or politics. Here it is both. <br />My request is that you want to be proud of this forgotten <br />civilization, please do. But dont shove it saying it is a fact <br />waiting to be discovered.<br />Everything that is there in Earth leaves its footprint. Chola <br />temples, however few they may be, still are examples that this great <br />dynasty existed. There are only a few pyramids left, for that <br />matter. Or may be a few skyscrapers left in NY. I remember the last <br />shot of that classic Charles Heston movie 'Planet of the apes' where <br />he discovers the footprint of NYC.<br />And ofcourse, science will take thousand of years for solving issues <br />like this precisely because of the amount of religious/political <br />dogma attached to it. It took 2000 years to prove that earth <br />revolved around the sun, but then it took another 200 years for <br />people to belive the same. <br />About the link, not sure you read through it. It talks about the <br />explosion of placental mammals(like rodents) at the end of the <br />Paleocene age. It is a long way from there to Homo species and to <br />Home Sapiens. As part of the mammals, we can say our fellow mammals, <br />some rat-like creatures roamed with Dinosaurs (that too only if you <br />believe the evolutionary fantasy!). Nothing more. This is what <br />happens when things get reported in a tabloid channel like Channel <br />four. I would say they should stick to 'Big Brother' and not bother <br />science.<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>From: an evolutionist point of view - what you can deem as concrete <br />evidence is what that meets the naked eye.

The <br />proof may not be as easy to figure out as it looks via science, we <br />are new borns when it comes to knowledge.

Also personal beliefs do not <br />  count as theories &#40;like fossils being lost during the emergence <br />of <br />  Himalayas&#41; unless backed by fine arguments. I look at it from a <br />guy <br />  who has done his <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of scientific reading and much of what I <br />read <br />  here is not quasi-science but pseudo-science.<br />   <br />  Lets deconstruct the points.<br />  1. &#39;Current timeline&#39; and &#39;theorizing evolution&#39;. I dont <br />understand <br />  this current timeline <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. Are we talking about a parallel <br />timeline <br />  as explained by the string theories? &#40;Three hours of full dose <br />  available here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="athttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/&amp;#41;">athttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/&amp;#41;</a><!-- m -->. Or the <br />  timeline as we understand? And evolution is not a few thousand <br />years <br />  of process but rather is going on for millions of years. Even <br />human <br />  evolution runs into millions of years. So not sure where <br />  the &#39;thousands&#39; crept in. Genographic study is a totally <br />different <br />  thing from evolution in that it attempts to map the migration of <br />  humans across globe over the last 10-20 thousand years through <br />DNA <br />  mapping. This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to prove <br />  that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a common <br />DNA. <br />  Same goes for the Earth&#39;s crust <br />  &#40;http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/index.php&#41;. <br />  There has been a lot of geological research that has been done <br />over <br />  the years from Charles Lyell&#39;s times&#40;who was an inspiration for <br />  Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory&#41; and ofcourse, <br />  geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

It is one thing to come up with hypothesis and another to <br />talk <br />  it up like its fact. Sorry Venkatesh, Flintstones are still a <br />  fantasy only.<br />  3. Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in your mail <br />  itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. Ofcourse, <br />the <br />  footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what the <br />  archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that there is <br />  still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to know <br />a <br />  lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely say <br />that <br />  we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the <br />depths <br />  of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the reasoning <br />  for &#39;Uthiramerur&#39; is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I&#39;ve read in this group so <br />far <br />  and so I chose to ignore it. <br />  I dont mind things being touted as based on religious <br />observations <br />  or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency to <br />mix <br />  science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked as <br />  factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist movement in <br />US <br />  and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont think it <br />is <br />  necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which are <br />clearly <br />  there to serve our vanities and nothing more. <br />   <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence <br />    during the dinosaur era and so on. <br />    <br />    Hi Venu<br />    is that so.? I thought the flintstones were pure fantasy.<br />    <br />    venketesh<br />    <br />    <br />    Again, this is a smaller time line <br />    compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize the <br />  majority <br />    of evolution. From: what I read, it looks like there are <br />theories <br />    based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the <br />closest <br />  to <br />    come on its time frame. <br />      Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great mystery <br />and <br />    unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as <br />explained: <br />  It <br />    is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground level <br />  during <br />    the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds of <br />    archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden terrains of <br />    himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth has <br />been <br />    close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the place <br />  where <br />    the keys have been lost is not the same where there is light to <br />    search.<br />      Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and <br />massive <br />    houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story to all, <br />  but <br />    how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc barring <br />the <br />    large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and <br />  Pallavas. <br />    Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, the <br />foot <br />    prints of millions of years can be burried into mother earth <br />for <br />    good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, the <br />  ocean <br />    is a whole different story. <br />      Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a <br />shortened <br />    sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />      I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under <br />water, <br />  the <br />    1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had done so <br />into <br />  a <br />    place &#40; older time was a mountain I believe&#41; called &#39;Uthira <br />Meru - <br />    today&#39;s uthiramerur&#39; these places forming the great deccan <br />plateau <br />    were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I believe. <br />      Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi <br />scientific <br />    model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic <br />tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /> <br />      <br />      Thanks folks!<br />      Ravi<br />      Muthu Prakash Ravindran  <br />    wrote: Hi<br />       <br />      I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />      1.

			<div class="content">Relentless pursuit of truth, but by always acknowledging the fact that what we know today due to science and science alone is a morsel of grain (not even a handful). As long as one is blinded to the fact as what meets the naked eye is what exists, the truth shall always lie hidden.<br />At one point you say pursuit of truth and other place you are disputing that ' there are things in this world waiting to be discovered '. Not all things leave a foot print. What you find today are just miniscule remnants of mighty kingdoms etc. The big foot is no where to be found and wont be too.<br /><br />Only during the dark ages humans assumed the earth is flat etc... A serious look at religious scripts can show that we knew these so called '2000 year old' scientific facts much before the advent of dark ages. We have even known much more things than what can possibly be thought as science of tomorrow.<br />We can chose to find a text in religion and attach a scientific thought to it and figure out a truth to it or sit in the dark and wait for science to come up with something as absurd as Darwin's theory and obviously as always... ignorance can be bliss.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R  wrote: I am not an evolutionaist but a guy who likes to look at things<br />unbiased and with a scientific perspective.

It is one thing to come up with hypothesis and another to<br />talk<br />  it up like its fact. Sorry Venkatesh, Flintstones are still a<br />  fantasy only.<br />  3. Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in your mail<br />  itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. Ofcourse,<br />the<br />  footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what the<br />  archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that there is<br />  still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to know<br />a<br />  lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely say<br />that<br />  we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the<br />depths<br />  of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the reasoning<br />  for &#39;Uthiramerur&#39; is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I&#39;ve read in this group so<br />far<br />  and so I chose to ignore it.<br />  I dont mind things being touted as based on religious<br />observations<br />  or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency to<br />mix<br />  science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked as<br />  factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist movement in<br />US<br />  and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont think it<br />is<br />  necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which are<br />clearly<br />  there to serve our vanities and nothing more.<br /> <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence<br />    during the dinosaur era and so on.<br />   <br />    Hi Venu<br />    is that so.? I thought the flintstones were pure fantasy.<br />   <br />    venketesh<br />   <br />   <br />    Again, this is a smaller time line<br />    compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize the<br />  majority<br />    of evolution. From what I read, it looks like there are<br />theories<br />    based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the<br />closest<br />  to<br />    come on its time frame.<br />      Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great mystery<br />and<br />    unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as<br />explained: <br />  It<br />    is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground level<br />  during<br />    the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds of<br />    archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden terrains of<br />    himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth has<br />been<br />    close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the place<br />  where<br />    the keys have been lost is not the same where there is light to<br />    search.<br />      Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and<br />massive<br />    houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story to all,<br />  but<br />    how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc barring<br />the<br />    large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and<br />  Pallavas.<br />    Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, the<br />foot<br />    prints of millions of years can be burried into mother earth<br />for<br />    good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, the<br />  ocean<br />    is a whole different story.<br />      Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a<br />shortened<br />    sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />      I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under<br />water,<br />  the<br />    1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had done so<br />into<br />  a<br />    place &#40; older time was a mountain I believe&#41; called &#39;Uthira<br />Meru -<br />    today&#39;s uthiramerur&#39; these places forming the great deccan<br />plateau<br />    were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I believe.<br />      Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi<br />scientific<br />    model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic<br />tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />     <br />      Thanks folks!<br />      Ravi<br />      Muthu Prakash Ravindran <br />    wrote: Hi<br />     <br />      I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />      1.

For that matter, I have also read a lot<br />      about Creationism and the common objections raised<br />      about Evolution and what Mr.Ram has raised is the most<br />      simple and often raised one.<br />      3. Theory that human evolution is simultaneous and so<br />      another ice age may end up in producing a new human<br />      history. This is again a &#39;faulty premise&#39;. I would<br />      think that the more advanced the civilization, the<br />      footprints will be more. Say the pyramids of Egypt or<br />      the Sumerian codes help us easily to decide what<br />      happened 5 thousand years back. At the same time,<br />      while humans were prowling in the heart of Africa or<br />      the Americas, where is the evidence of their life 5<br />      thousand years ago? Similarly, the example you&#39;ve<br />      quoted, New York is more likely to leave a bigger<br />      footprint for the future generations to decipher than<br />      the Australian aborigines. For the simple reason that<br />      the civilization is highly advanced.<br />      There is nothing logical in the lemurian theory. If<br />      there was a high civilization existed in these<br />      hypothetical lands, where are their foot prints? given<br />      that we place them within the timeframe of the<br />      Pyramids, where are their monuments under water? No<br />      evidence, but a bunch of theories from the Dravidian<br />      stalwarts&#40;who propagated this theory in the first<br />      place&#41; without even a semblance of proof attached to<br />      it. Read about how Mr.Vaiyapuri Pillai calculated the<br />      time of the Sangam literature &#40;he places the sangan<br />      periods in the 1-2 century AD&#41;. No one has refuted him<br />      on his method but always through the narrow eyes of a<br />      chauvinist.<br />     <br />      There is a book out there written by Sumathi Ramasamy<br />      &#39;Fabulous geographies, catastophic histories&#39; which<br />      deals well with the theory of Lemuria and<br />      unfortunately, no &#39;self-respected&#39; Tamil will read<br />      this and get some sort of enlightenment.<br />     <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />     <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --><br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />     <br />      "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said<br />  Alice, &#39;because<br />    I&#39;m not myself you see.&#39;"<br />      -Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div></blockquote></div>
