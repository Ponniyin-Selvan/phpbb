It is <br />constructed of red bricks,<br />quite smooth and of a small size; with so little cement, that it has <br />been disputed whether any at all had been used. An intelligent <br />native who was with me when I examined the building said that a <br />cement had been used,<br />constituting entirely of the earth thrown up by the white ants in <br />forming their mounds and cells. That this earth had been ground into <br />a fine paste and used as a cement between each brick.<br />The tower is so lofty as to be the first object visible at sea and <br />was used by the Dutch for their flagstaff. <br /><br />I have been concerned to hear a report, which I hope is untrue, that <br />preparations were making to take it down..Ã¢Â€Â<br /><br />Sadly, HooleÃ¢Â€Â™s fears were proven to be true.

Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of <br />205<br />      poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is <br />written <br />  by<br />      Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of <br />  the<br />      these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai <br />was <br />    love<br />      between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi <br />is<br />      daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer&#39;s interpretation and<br />      commentary on Kurunthokai.<br />      <br />      3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of <br />  Murugan<br />      and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />      allusions point to.<br />      <br />      4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, <br />  where <br />    the<br />      hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to <br />Murugan. <br />    This<br />      a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of <br />Kurunthokai <br />    are<br />      common people and not Murugan and Valli.<br />      <br />      Kurunthokai 1<br />      Making the field red with his killing<br />      <br />      he crushes demons.<br />      <br />      He has red shafted arrows,<br />      <br />      red -tusked elephants,<br />      <br />      whirling battle anklets.<br />      <br />      This hill belongs to Murugan<br />      <br />      and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.<br />      <br />      Tipput Tolar<br />      <br />      &#40;Translated by George L. Hart&#41;<br />      <br />      The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift <br />  of <br />    red<br />      kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have <br />him.In <br />    this<br />      poem she refuses his offering&#40;based on commentary of U V Sa&#41;.<br />      <br />      4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as <br />  God <br />    who<br />      caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />    when u<br />      finish reading it every one would surely like to question <br />  Mr.Ravi&#39;s<br />      interpretations.<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05 ... esickness/</a><!-- m --> <br />      <br />      5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person <br />  who <br />    try<br />      their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />    intensive<br />      training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are <br />specially<br />      trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and <br />intensive<br />      training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder <br />how <br />  Mr.<br />      Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars <br />who <br />    have<br />      undergone training to read these literatures.<br />      <br />      6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most <br />  respected<br />      persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write <br />a<br />      letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />    Language.<br />      He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />    commit so<br />      grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont <br />  think <br />    he<br />      would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />    letter<br />      he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a <br />classical <br />    Language.<br />      <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/ ... on-status-</a><!-- m --><br />of-<br />    tamil-as.html<br />      <br />      <br />      These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />      I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready <br />to<br />      produce the following: <br />      1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under <br />  consideration<br />      2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />      2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it <br />his <br />    own<br />      interpretation.<br />      3. Is there any written source which has been critically <br />  examined <br />    to<br />      support his claim.<br />      4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />    discussion<br />      of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.<br />      <br />      I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />    reply. I<br />      simply cannot accept &#39; Fact becomes myth&#39; story.<br />      <br />      Thank you.<br />      <br />      <br />      Regards,<br />      Vairam<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  <br />wrote: <br />       <br />        Dear Vijay<br />        <br />        I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a <br />    person <br />        who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his <br />    Tamil <br />        skill, his knowledge is amazing.<br />         <br />        But that does not mean that there is only one translation <br />and <br />  it <br />        means what he said.

But save in name<br />it has<br />nothing in common with Hindu or Muhammadan architecture, either in<br />form or<br />ornament."<br /><br />"In 1859, the Jesuit Fathers presented a petition to the Madras<br />Government<br />representing the tower to be in a dangerous condition, and requesting<br />permission to pull it down and appropriate the materials to their own<br />use...." In 1867 "the Fathers renewed their application for leave to<br />remove it, on the following grounds: '1st, because they considered<br />it to<br />be unsafe in its present condition; 2nd, because it obstructed light<br />and<br />sea-breeze from a chapel which they had built behind it; 3rd,<br />because they<br />would very much like to get the land on which it stood; and 4th,<br />because<br />the bricks of which it was built would be very useful to them for<br />building<br />purposes.'<br /><br />"The Chief Engineer, who meanwhile had himself examined the edifice,<br />and<br />had directed the District Engineer to prepare a small estimate for<br />its<br />repair, reported that the first only of the above reasons had any<br />weight,<br />and that it would be met if Colonel O'Connell's estimate, prepared<br />under<br />his own orders, received the sanction of Government. He therefore<br />recommended that this should be given, and the tower allowed to<br />stand....<br /><br />"The Chief Engineer's proposal did not meet with approval, and on<br />the 28th<br />August 1867, the following order was made on the Jesuits'<br />petition: 'The<br />Governor in Council is pleased to sanction the removal of the old<br />tower at<br />Negapatam by the officers of St. Joseph's College, at their own<br />expense,<br />and the appropriation of the available material to such school-<br />building<br />purposes as they appear to have in contemplation.<br /><br />"The Fathers were not slow in availing themselves of this<br />permission. The<br />venerable building was speedily levelled, and the site cleared."<br /><br />In making excavations connected with the college a bronze image<br />representing a Buddhist or Jaina priest in the costume and attitude<br />of the<br />figures in wood and metal brought from Burma was found; it was<br />presented<br />to Lord Napier, in 1868; a reproduction of it is given in Sir Walter<br />Elliot's paper.<br /><br />In a note added by Dr. Burnell to this paper, we read: "As I several<br />times<br />in 1866 visited the ruin referred to, I may be permitted to say that<br />it<br />had become merely a shapeless mass of bricks. I have no doubt that<br />it was<br />originally a _vimana_ or shrine of some temple; there are some of<br />precisely the same construction in parts of the Chingleput district."</div>

Tansen Sen<br />suggests that "some<br />credit for the `emergence of a world market' must go to the Chola<br />(or CÃ´la) kingdom in<br />Southern India. The trading ports and mercantile guilds of the Chola<br />kingdom, he<br />suggests, played a significant role in linking the markets of China<br />to the rest of the<br />world." 97 He cites the following passage from a Cola ruler as the<br />rationale for<br />participating in and encouraging maritime trade: <br />Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants<br />and<br />good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and<br />decent<br />dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents<br />and allowing<br />them profits. Then those articles will never go to your enemies.98<br />Sen notes the intimate relationship between the temples, merchant<br />guilds,<br />Brahman communities and the Chola rulers, and how the Chola rulers<br />frequently turned<br />over conquered regions to Brahman communities for developmental<br />purposes, and that<br />these communities then involved the merchant guilds in temple<br />construction.99 This idea<br />continued that of Meera Abraham, who noted that the intimate links<br />among the Chola<br />state, merchant guilds, and religious institutions was one of<br />the "vital elements of the<br />CÃ´la state synthesis of the eleventh century."100 Abraham in turn<br />drew much from earlier<br />studies by Nilakanta Sastri.101<br />The conquest of southern Karnataka by the Chola ruler RÃ¢jÃ§ndra in<br />1032, for<br />example, appears to have been aimed at securing internal trade<br />routes in southern India<br />for the Tamil merchant guilds. At the same time, there seems little<br />doubt that the Chola<br />attacks waged on Southeast Asia port polities in 1025 and again in<br />the 1070s, as well as<br />the occupation of Sri Lanka in 1080, were all intended to expand the<br />commercial interests<br />of the polity's merchants and thereby of the polity itself.102 The<br />commercial towns of the<br />Chola polity appear to have reached a zenith between the late 12th<br />and mid-13th, possibly<br />as a result of the wealth realised through these overseas markets.<br />It also appears that the Chola-China links reached a zenith about<br />the same time.<br />From the mid-13th century we have the Dao-yi zhi-lue account which<br />records the<br />Chinese-sponsored pagoda at Nagapattinam which bore an inscription<br />in Chinese noting<br />that it was completed in the equivalent of 1267. This was balanced<br />by a Tamil temple in<br />Quan-zhou dated by inscription to 1281, suggesting quite a community<br />of Tamils in the<br />city during this period of effervescence.103<br />The trade between the ports of South China and the Chola polity is<br />also evidenced by<br />the 11-12th century Chinese ceramic remains found widely in Sri<br />Lanka and Tamil<br />Nadu.104 Classical Chinese texts also inform us that the Chinese<br />obtained all of their<br />pepper from Indian ports, and there was obviously a strong trade in<br />textiles travelling<br />both ways.105<br />Tansen Sen suggests that, "In fact, Tamil merchant guilds may have<br />been as active on<br />the Sino-Indian circuit of Indian Ocean commerce as were there Arab<br />counterparts. More<br />importantly, however, the coastal region of India and Northern Sri<br />Lanka under Chola<br />rule provided a well-organised trading mechanism through which<br />commodities could<br />flow from China, on the one end of the global market, to the Persian<br />Gulf and<br />Mediterranean ports on the other."106 While it is true that most of<br />the maritime merchants<br />travelling into China bore names which can be reconstructed as<br />Islamic, we have no<br />knowledge as to the degree to which Tamil Muslim converts continued<br />to trade along the<br />routes and possibly through the same guilds which the earlier Hindu<br />merchants had done.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div></div></blockquote>pg 46<br /><br />10. Maritime Trade related Warfare<br />It has been suggested that, following the emergence of Angkor in the<br />9th century,<br />the was frequent conflict with Champa was predominantly over access<br />to China trade<br />products and control of ports (remembering that much of what is<br />today the southern<br />Vietnamese coast was at this time subject to the Khmer polity of<br />Angkor).<br />In the Straits of Malacca, attacks on Srivijaya were initiated by<br />Java in the 10th<br />century and then by the Cholas in the 11th century. The important<br />location of the polity on<br />the maritime trade routes was undoubtedly what induced these attacks.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>pg 6</div></blockquote><br />By the late 11th century, envoys to Song China were paid for their<br />goods in copper<br />coin and silver bullion, and no longer in the gold, silver or copper<br />objects previously<br />provided. 35 Such payments/rewards were provided to, for example,<br />missions from<br />Champa (1072 and 1086), an Arab polity (1073), the Chola polity<br />(1077), and Srivijaya<br />(1078).<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>chart on pg 7</div></blockquote><br />The major partners in this official trade are detailed below.<br />Table 2 Â– Se Asian Polities which sent Official Trade Missions to<br />Song Court<br /><br />Polity 960-1087 1087-1200 1200-1276<br />Srivijaya 20 8 -<br />Champa 44 7 8<br />The Arab lands 30 5<br />Annam 4 10 6<br />Butuan 3<br />Chola 4<br />Java 2 1<br />Brunei 2<br />Cambodia 2 3<br />Fu-lin (Rum) 2<br />India 2<br /><br />Source: Based on Billy So, Prosperity, Region and Institutions in<br />Maritime China, p. 56, adjusted through<br />reference to Hartwell, Tribute Missions to China 960-1126.</div>

			<div class="content">-Sen notes the intimate relationship between the temples, merchant<br />guilds,<br />Brahman communities and the Chola rulers, and how the Chola rulers<br />frequently turned<br />over conquered regions to Brahman communities for developmental<br />purposes, and that<br />these communities then involved the merchant guilds in temple<br />construction.99 This idea<br />continued that of Meera Abraham, who noted that the intimate links<br />among the Chola<br />state, merchant guilds, and religious institutions was one of<br />the &quot;vital elements of the<br />Chola state synthesis of the eleventh century.&quot;100 <br /><br />Abraham in turn<br />drew much from earlier<br />studies by Nilakanta Sastri.<br />=================<br /><br />Vijay, <br /><br />I remember to have read in the Bibliography - KAN Sastry's book <br />related to Foreign trade activities !<br /><br />What an observation !!<br /><br />sps</div>

Thirumangai Azhwar's reference <br />to this image is as lord who lays on the sea shore.<br /><br />the vishnu image ( now in really sad state) seems to be an earlier <br />structure around which two temples of shiva were erected by rajasimha <br />pallava.<br /><br />This eastern temple is called Kshatriya-simhesvara ( four storied), <br />and the western one is Rajasimhesvara ( three storied). The Vishnu <br />shrine sandwiched is called Narapati-simha-Pallava-Vishnu-griha (the <br />name is inscribed in pallava grantam) and as per scholars is the <br />oldest sculpture in mallai . <br /><br />These names are inscribed on the temples and are named after the <br />titles of Rajasimha. <br /><br />The inscription of Rajaraja, the greatest Chola, found here calls the <br />complex as Jalasayanam and the Vishnu shrine as Pall-kandaruliya-<br />thevar ... so too rajendra chola's inscriptions. ( south indian <br />inscriptions volume 2)<br /><br />rgds<br />vj</div>
