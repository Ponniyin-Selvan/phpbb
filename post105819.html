			<div class="content">A point blank question, is this a blunt approval of the slipper <br />garland process ? <br /><br />Vaariyar shouting in a session is NOT to be equated to this <br />demonstration, I dont think that is a fair comparison. <br /><br />Ravana uttered the name of Rama more than any one else in Ramayana. <br />He was given mukthi and granted the vision of the Paramatma. <br />EVR Statue... today sits right in front of Ranganathar Shrine. <br />I have not noticed so I would like to know the pose in which his <br />statue is built. Is it upright ? <br /><br />-- Ravi<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "akumarg1976" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider putting a<br />    disclaimer, that &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattu mirandi&#39; do not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought? I am sure the answer<br />    you will get is total silence.<br />  <br />  It obviously means that only. No need for any disclaimer. I know <br />many <br />  people who dont get offended by this and understand the reality and <br />  necessity of this statement, like our SPS and Nithya.<br />  <br />  The most effective way to make an illiterate mass to HEAR <br />&#40;listening <br />  is after that&#41; to what you say could be this. Kind of shock <br />treatment <br />  for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting &#39;Maaaarchhhh...&#39; <br />  in the middle of his speech. If we ask him &#39;Swami, why did you <br />  shout?&#39;, his reply would be &#39;thoongaravanellaam ezhundhirikka <br />  vendaamaa?&#39;. Its more or less similar to that. There may be any <br />other <br />  better way, but periyar thought this would work out well where <br />  superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething for slipper <br />  garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we dont worship.<br />  <br />  Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was misunderstood. <br />  Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that these puranas have <br />  good things too. But there are many other people to explain that. <br />  Periyar&#39;s motive was different. If anything makes the man slave to <br />  another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it without any <br />  hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it is Thamizhp <br />  pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit into this <br />category, <br />  suggest to read his &#39;Characters of Ramayana&#39; and Anna&#39;s &#39;Aariya <br />  maayai&#39; or &#39;Needhi dhevan mayakkam&#39;. The court scene in needhi <br />dhevan <br />  mayakkam perfectly fits for today&#39;s sethu samudhram case also.<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  A.Kumaraguruparan<br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan  <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />    said, TN is one of the most casteist states. Casteism<br />    is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In parts of<br />    Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used to<br />    live, there are whole villages that are christian and<br />    muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />    escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />    true fact.<br />    <br />    During EVR&#39;s time there were lot of brahmins employed<br />    with British like Venkat said. Temples were largely<br />    governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />    brahmin communities particularly widows was very poor.<br />    All these factors contributed him to start the<br />    struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR was<br />    alive today he would continue this struggle the same<br />    way or even use the same language that he did. <br />    <br />    I have shown the EVR site to american atheists even,<br />    before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />    them on his history and service. They did understand<br />    but many of them felt in all respect that the quotes<br />    of &#39;kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu mirandi&#39;<br />    were completely outdated with today&#39;s times. Atheism<br />    in the west places huge emphasis on give and take of<br />    respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are rewritten.<br />    Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />    hindus. British edited a popular children&#39;s author<br />    Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider putting a<br />    disclaimer, that &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattu mirandi&#39; do not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought? I am sure the answer<br />    you will get is total silence.<br />    <br />    I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />    rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility to go<br />    through archives for all that has been said on the<br />    subject but when I do perhaps will have more questions<br />    <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41; Thanks.<br />    <br />    --- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br />    <br />      Hi<br />      i for one have come from one of the most casteist<br />      areas of tamil nadu.<br />      a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />      every year for the <br />      high tensions prevailing during the ther function.<br />      the government has <br />      cancelled the ther rather than shed blood sometimes.<br />      <br />      the swarna murthy temple is owned by the sivaganga<br />      queen, was rebuilt <br />      and embellished with sculpture by the nagarathars.<br />      but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />      dalits.<br />      <br />      where did the bramhin come into this?<br />      the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the picture.<br />      <br />      this example i am quoting to &#39;absolve" the bramhin<br />      community of <br />      creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />      the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945<br />      was not the <br />      bramhin if you take village wise.<br />      the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars<br />      and the vandayars <br />      in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />      reddiars in mid <br />      tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the<br />      thevars in the <br />      south etc....<br />      they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />      local school and <br />      generally decided who had to do what. if you observe<br />      without bias <br />      these caste configurations still prevail in these<br />      areas.<br />      the aim of the &#39;justice party&#39; was to target<br />      braminism not in village <br />      level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />      a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />      aptitude for learning <br />      caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />      british india. the <br />      justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />      this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled<br />      them towards <br />      greener pastures.<br />      <br />      like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer.<br />      my family was <br />      closely involved in the justice party in the early<br />      years.<br />      <br />      venketesh<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu<br />      Prakash <br />      R"  wrote: <br />       <br />        Sathish<br />        <br />        Having some familiarity with the tamil movement<br />      in the last 150 <br />        years and read through a few of the books, here<br />      are my comments.<br />        <br />        1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />      Tamilnadu as a <br />        antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />      these areas. Refer <br />        Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />      movement fostered <br />        primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />      the Athinams of <br />        these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />      and promote <br />      Saivism <br />        as an active alternative.<br />        2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />      Saivism is based on <br />        the fact that it lead to the contact with &#39;low&#39;<br />      castes and the <br />        language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />      &#39;exclusivity&#39; of <br />        sanskrit.<br />        3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />      look into the <br />        history of the ascendent &#39;low&#39; castes/high castes<br />      of these times <br />        &#40;like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc&#41;, they<br />      ended up building <br />        temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />      and the pooja was <br />        done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />      Kuladeivam temple is <br />        in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />      my talks with the <br />        poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />      atleast 3-4 <br />        generations. This is also recorded in the<br />      Hardgrave&#39;s history on <br />        Nadars and Caldwell&#39;s history on Thirunelveli<br />      &#40;both are available <br />        and in print&#41;. This is true in any number of<br />      temples built by the <br />        low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />      perunthivangal. <br />        4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />      society in terms of <br />        prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />      the Brahmins who <br />        were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />      was found to not <br />        yield results, they sort of &#39;rebelled&#39; and<br />      asserted themselves by <br />        building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />        5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />      of you here for <br />        the kind of reaction espoused by DK &#40;the Justice<br />      party before that&#41; <br />        is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />      oppression that <br />        went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />      the late last <br />        century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />      above along with <br />        the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />      to it in <br />        U.Ve.Sa&#39;s &#39;En sarithiram&#39;, the journals of the<br />      Saveriraya pillai <br />        &#40;who converted to Christianity&#41; etc. It is no use<br />      just expressing <br />        outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />      context. <br />        Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />      avoiding the <br />        Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />      DK. If you look <br />        into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />      comes from a <br />      very <br />        religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />      the downtrodden. <br />        Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />      change the system <br />        from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />      break up the <br />      entire <br />        system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />      Ramayan and <br />      other <br />        established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />      aside and a new <br />        society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />      now.<br />        <br />        The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />      Tamil, for better or <br />        worse and it is not a &#39;religious fundamentalist&#39;<br />      movement but a <br />        nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />      from years of <br />        oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />      people together <br />        and build a new society. How much good/bad came<br />      out of it is <br />        debatable. <br />        <br />        Muthu Prakash R<br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogpost.com">http://sibipranav.blogpost.com</a><!-- m --><br />        <br />        <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - As an aside my father spent a day in the<br />      police station during <br />        the 1964 agitations for taking part in a<br />      anti-hindi rally in <br />        Madurai.

			<div class="content">There is an unsubstantiated story that EVR himself was<br />a 'secret beliver' in his last days, being fed up with<br />politics in his party and workers. Venkat mentioned<br />opulent pooja rooms in his family, I have heard of<br />that also, from some relatives in Trichy.<br /><br />This type of twisted argument that slipper garland was<br />to prove God does not take offence is not convincing<br />to anyone. First of all neither Periyar nor his<br />followers ever said that, it is others saying that for<br />them. Secondly there are limits to subscribe to as far<br />as interpretation goes. I cannot slap my mother to<br />prove to the world that she won't take offence. A slap<br />hurts and implies disrespect that is all. If I want to<br />prove she wont take offence I say that first of all,<br />and prove it in less insulting ways if I have to.<br /><br />--- Ravi  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A point blank question, is this a blunt approval of<br />  the slipper<br />  garland process ?<br /> <br />  Vaariyar shouting in a session is NOT to be equated<br />  to this<br />  demonstration, I dont think that is a fair<br />  comparison.<br /> <br />  Ravana uttered the name of Rama more than any one<br />  else in Ramayana.<br />  He was given mukthi and granted the vision of the<br />  Paramatma.<br />  EVR Statue... today sits right in front of<br />  Ranganathar Shrine.<br />  I have not noticed so I would like to know the pose<br />  in which his<br />  statue is built.

Its more or less similar to that.<br />  There may be any<br />  other<br />    better way, but periyar thought this would work<br />  out well where<br />    superstition is spread in the name of god.<br />  Samething for slipper<br />    garland for idols to show that god wont punish if<br />  we dont worship.<br />   <br />    Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was<br />  misunderstood.<br />    Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />  these puranas have<br />    good things too. But there are many other people<br />  to explain that.<br />    Periyar&#39;s motive was different. If anything makes<br />  the man slave to<br />    another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate<br />  it without any<br />    hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if<br />  it is Thamizhp<br />    pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit<br />  into this<br />  category,<br />    suggest to read his &#39;Characters of Ramayana&#39; and<br />  Anna&#39;s &#39;Aariya<br />    maayai&#39; or &#39;Needhi dhevan mayakkam&#39;.

Yes I agree with what you and<br />  Ravi<br />      said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />  Casteism<br />      is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />  parts of<br />      Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle<br />  used to<br />      live, there are whole villages that are<br />  christian and<br />      muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will<br />  be<br />      escorted out politely to village limits. This is<br />  a<br />      true fact.<br />     <br />      During EVR&#39;s time there were lot of brahmins<br />  employed<br />      with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />  largely<br />      governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />      brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />  poor.<br />      All these factors contributed him to start the<br />      struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if<br />  EVR was<br />      alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />  same<br />      way or even use the same language that he did.<br />     <br />      I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />  even,<br />      before this gentleman showed it to me, and<br />  briefed<br />      them on his history and service. They did<br />  understand<br />      but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />  quotes<br />      of &#39;kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />  mirandi&#39;<br />      were completely outdated with today&#39;s times.<br />  Atheism<br />      in the west places huge emphasis on give and<br />  take of<br />      respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />  rewritten.<br />      Manu smriti is being reworded by many<br />  progressive<br />      hindus. British edited a popular children&#39;s<br />  author<br />      Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />      wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />  putting a<br />      disclaimer, that &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattu mirandi&#39; do<br />  not<br />      include many believers who have supported anti<br />      casteism and rational thought?

You only opened this phrase <br />yesterday and i just explained (did not justify) about the situation <br />when it was said. Now, you turn the plate and blame me as if i told <br />this to you. First of all, i dont see any need for this phrase in the <br />context of this thread. No idea about your motive on pulling this <br />thread towards corruption by kalaignar, which no one denies including <br />his party men. If you want to debate with atheists, there must be <br />some groups for that or periyar thidal is the right place. You will <br />get good response and can come back safely. They are not given swords.<br /><br />In the same line of your thinking, referring one caste as 'upper <br />caste' is also unethical and it disrespects others. Have you ever <br />realised that?<br /><br />I too dont want to continue participating in this thread as it is not <br />the place for fight between religious and anti-religious groups. This <br />group may involve culture in its interest, but the wild term culture <br />refers to everything from the evolution of human race. I think it is <br />time to differentiate between what element of cultures are attributed <br />to history, which falls under the interests of this group and what <br />are not.<br /><br />I dont just hope, but will show in action too. I have nothing to <br />loose by stop replying.

So the statement was put in to &#39;wake up&#39; masses??<br />  How long has it been since masses actually believed<br />  priests and brahmins? <br />  And how many DMK politicians including Kalaignar have<br />  taken total advantage of their ignorance for getting<br />  votes and staying in office?

Periyar was from the freedom fighers<br />  generation, he was unselfish and committed to his<br />  cause. The cause was diluted in Anna&#39;s times.

If we ask him &#39;Swami,<br />    why did you <br />    shout?&#39;, his reply would be &#39;thoongaravanellaam<br />    ezhundhirikka <br />    vendaamaa?&#39;. Its more or less similar to that. There<br />    may be any other <br />    better way, but periyar thought this would work out<br />    well where <br />    superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething<br />    for slipper <br />    garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we<br />    dont worship.<br />    <br />    Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was<br />    misunderstood. <br />    Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />    these puranas have <br />    good things too. But there are many other people to<br />    explain that. <br />    Periyar&#39;s motive was different. If anything makes<br />    the man slave to <br />    another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it<br />    without any <br />    hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it<br />    is Thamizhp <br />    pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit<br />    into this category, <br />    suggest to read his &#39;Characters of Ramayana&#39; and<br />    Anna&#39;s &#39;Aariya <br />    maayai&#39; or &#39;Needhi dhevan mayakkam&#39;. The court scene<br />    in needhi dhevan <br />    mayakkam perfectly fits for today&#39;s sethu samudhram<br />    case also.<br />    <br />    Regards<br />    A.Kumaraguruparan<br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />    Mahadevan  <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />      said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />    Casteism<br />      is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />    parts of<br />      Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used<br />    to<br />      live, there are whole villages that are christian<br />    and<br />      muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />      escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />      true fact.<br />      <br />      During EVR&#39;s time there were lot of brahmins<br />    employed<br />      with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />    largely<br />      governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />      brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />    poor.<br />      All these factors contributed him to start the<br />      struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR<br />    was<br />      alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />    same<br />      way or even use the same language that he did. <br />      <br />      I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />    even,<br />      before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />      them on his history and service. They did<br />    understand<br />      but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />    quotes<br />      of &#39;kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />    mirandi&#39;<br />      were completely outdated with today&#39;s times.<br />    Atheism<br />      in the west places huge emphasis on give and take<br />    of<br />      respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />    rewritten.<br />      Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />      hindus. British edited a popular children&#39;s author<br />      Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />      wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />    putting a<br />      disclaimer, that &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattu mirandi&#39; do<br />    not<br />      include many believers who have supported anti<br />      casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />    answer<br />      you will get is total silence.<br />      <br />      I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />      rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility<br />    to go<br />      through archives for all that has been said on the<br />      subject but when I do perhaps will have more<br />    questions<br />      <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41; Thanks.<br />      <br />      --- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br />      <br />        Hi<br />        i for one have come from one of the most<br />    casteist<br />        areas of tamil nadu.<br />        a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />        every year for the <br />        high tensions prevailing during the ther<br />    function.<br />        the government has <br />        cancelled the ther rather than shed blood<br />    sometimes.<br />        <br />        the swarna murthy temple is owned by the<br />    sivaganga<br />        queen, was rebuilt <br />        and embellished with sculpture by the<br />    nagarathars.<br />        but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />        dalits.<br />        <br />        where did the bramhin come into this?<br />        the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the<br />    picture.<br />        <br />        this example i am quoting to &#39;absolve" the<br />    bramhin<br />        community of <br />        creating caste divides in a major part of<br />    tamilnadu.<br />        the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900<br />    -1945<br />        was not the <br />        bramhin if you take village wise.<br />        the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the<br />    moopanars<br />        and the vandayars <br />        in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />        reddiars in mid <br />        tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north,<br />    the<br />        thevars in the <br />        south etc....<br />        they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />        local school and <br />        generally decided who had to do what. if you<br />    observe<br />        without bias <br />        these caste configurations still prevail in<br />    these<br />        areas.<br />        the aim of the &#39;justice party&#39; was to target<br />        braminism not in village <br />        level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />        a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />        aptitude for learning <br />        caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />        british india. the <br />        justice party caused a bogey man. a fear<br />    psychosis.<br />        this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly<br />    propelled<br />        them towards <br />        greener pastures.<br />        <br />        like everybody before i need to put in a<br />    disclaimer.<br />        my family was <br />        closely involved in the justice party in the<br />    early<br />        years.<br />        <br />    <br />  === message truncated ===<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />        <br />______________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />  know-it-all with Yahoo!

It<br />would be good for you too to say I did not intend<br />anytihng personal to anyone who is non dravidian, that<br />is all.

So the statement was put in to &#39;wake up&#39;<br />  masses??<br />    How long has it been since masses actually<br />  believed<br />    priests and brahmins?<br />    And how many DMK politicians including Kalaignar<br />  have<br />    taken total advantage of their ignorance for<br />  getting<br />    votes and staying in office?
