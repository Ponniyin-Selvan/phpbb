			<div class="content">I am branching out this thread "Tribute to Kunnakudi" to the subject<br />mentioned in the subject line.<br /><br />As mentioned healthy competition gave us good songs I am adding a few more<br />examples.<br /><br /><br />1. No one can forget the song "Vaan Nila Nila Alla" song. This was Mr.MSV<br />and Kaviarasar Combo. Mr.MSV had decided on the tune and asked Kaviarasar to<br />come out with lyrics which would end with 'La'. Earlier Kaviarasar was<br />lethargic or I am not sure what mind set he was in ... he didnt produce his<br />gems. Mr.MSV wanted the best of Kaviarasar and started scolding him. Why are<br />you called Kaviarasar when you cant write a simple lyric for such a simple<br />tune. Kaviarasar got furious and wrote about 15 saranams for that song.<br />2. Ninaithaale Inikkum is a KB movie and Sujtha was in charge of story<br />and Screen play. This particular incident Sujatha had narrated in his<br />Katradhum Petradhum book. KB once asked Sujatha, whether he had attended any<br />song composition session of MSV and Kaviarasar, for which Sujatha answered<br />in negative. KB took him to the studio where MSV was present with his<br />harmonium. Kaviarasar was asusual late. For the first 15 - 20 minutes they<br />both were discussing about health (Kusalam Visarichu aachu!) Then MSV<br />reminded him about the song composition and proposed the tune. Thannane<br />Thannane Thannane Thannane ... Immediate was Kaviarasar's reply "Yengeyum<br />Yeppodum Sangeetham Sandhosham" MSV sang the tune for the next line.<br />Kaviarasar enquired KB whether he can say something philasophical and KB<br />agreed. Immediate was Kaviarasar's lyric "Rathirigal Vandhuvittal<br />Sastirangal Odividum" Sujatha has written that the whole song was completed<br />in 15 minutes. Sujatha asked Kaviarasar, "How is it possible for him to<br />write lyrics with such an ease". Kaviarasar's answer was simple, "If you<br />know the "Sandha Varthaigal" then it is not at all difficult" -- Easier said<br />than done.<br /><br />I can keep on writing about Kaviarasar but working on a project proposal and<br />my Group head is sitting on my head ...<br /><br />Laters!<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br /><br /><br />On Tue, Sep 9, 2008 at 7:09 PM, SatishKumar Arunachalam <<br />satisharun@...  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A great loss indeed.<br /> <br />  On Kunnakudi, I remember one of his yesteryear interview to DD..he was<br />  talking about greatness of Kannadasan...while composing the &#39;maruda<br />  malai maamuniye&#39; song, Kunnakudi wanted to challenge Kannadasan and<br />  hence composed difficult bits but Kaviyarasu without any effort were<br />  composing the lyrics as soon as Kunnakudi finished.<br /> <br />  Towards the end of the song, Kunnakudi was really annoyed and wanted<br />  to throw the toughest and gave the tune of the final verses and again<br />  kaviyarasu with little effort came up with the words &#39;kadal athu,<br />  malai athu&#39; and everyone was dumbstruck.<br /> <br />  Healthy competition gave us good songs then. Rare to see such healthy<br />  competition these days when the ego takes over everything.<br /> <br />  Salutations to the departed soul.<br /> <br />  Satish</div></blockquote><br /><br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>

			<div class="content">Sathish,<br />Well said. Thats the right word LEGENDS!<br /><br />Is there an Ilayaraja fan in you. Join the club mate. I am not sure about IR<br />composing all the songs in a movie in 20 minutes.But I do have a couple of<br />trivia about IR<br /><br /><br />1. He composed songs for Kadhal Oviyum (Bharathiraja / IR/ Vairamuthu in<br />which Radh and a blind man play the lead role) in two days and that too due<br />to non availability of SPB. All the songs in the movie are super duper hit.<br />2. Who can forget "Ilamai yenum Poongadru" song (This song is for Sridevi<br />and the actor who plays Radhika's fathers role in the latest serial) from<br />the film "Pagalil oru Iravu" After the song lyrics was handed over to IR he<br />composed the tunes and the recorded the song in 17 minutes!<br />3. In the film "Sindhu Bhairavi" when ever Suhasini is in scene the<br />background score is based on Sindhu Bhairavi Raham. He will display all the<br />facets of that Raga in that film. All IR fans would have noticed that.<br />4. Mari Mari Ninne song in Sindhu Bhairavi. The original raham by Saint<br />Tyagaraja for this song was Kambodhi. But this man had the audacity to<br />compose the song based on Saramathi. If I have to explain in cricketing<br />terms - Play a cover drive on a over pitched ball. Hook a ball when it is<br />short pitched and raising. This is the cricketing grammar. But this man<br />composing Mari Mari Ninne in Saramathi is like hooking a over pitched<br />delivery to the square leg boundary for a clean six!<br />5. Experimenting with Ragas like composing a song on a raga which is<br />supposed to depict Sad mood. "Kandu Pudichen Kandhu Pudichen" from Guru<br />Sishyan. This is based on Bhavapriya Raga and this raga is full of sorrow<br />mood.<br />6. Composing songs on rare ragas which others dare to touch like<br />"Simhendra Madhyamam", "Kanakangi" (This is the 1st raga in the Melakartha),<br />"Natakapriya", "Ramapriya", "Reethigowlai", "Rasikapriya"(72nd Melakarta<br />Raga)<br /><br />Laters!<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />On Tue, Sep 9, 2008 at 8:10 PM, SatishKumar Arunachalam <<br />satisharun@...  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thats why we call them legends...<br /> <br />  I heard that Ilayaraja composed all the five songs of a movie, forgot<br />  which one, in just 20 mins...and the movie was a super duper hit for<br />  the songs..<br /> <br />  Today it takes almost a year for a music director to compose 5 songs,<br />  that too with all the latest gadgets...<br /> <br />  And again coming to the &#39;marudha malai maamuniye&#39; song, the producer<br />  Chinnappa Devar was nearby while composing the song, and Marudamalai<br />  being Devar&#39;s favorite &#40;I think Devar decided to go to chennai only at<br />  Marudamalai&#41;, Kaviarasar gave the second line, &#39;Devaring kulam kakkum<br />  velayya&#39;...Devar was fully pleased.<br /> <br />  I think we have enough in our archives written by R.Venkatesh.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote><br /><br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>

			<div class="content">I must confess my ignorance as far as IR melodies go. I do know quite a biton Kaviarasar related anecdotes. The marudhamalai maamani song used to be a personal favorite of MAdurai Somu and he ended every concert unfailingly with it. The 'devarin kulam kaakum..' line was accidental, not intentional.KD was out of money to perform his last daughter's wedding which was one week away. The usual practice was for the producer to pay the song writer after all songs were penned and set to tune. There was some time left for Deivam songs - he accidentally wrote the line Devarin kulam kakkum velayya, which pleased chinnappa devar so much that he offered 1 lakh on the spot and the wedding went off with great pomp and show. <br />Â <br />Most of KD's songs have hidden meanings - Sivakaami maganidamum is refereceto Kamaraj, Nalamdaana is for Arignar Anna, Poyille pirandu is for his girlfriend and actress Devika, NeeyumÂ Naanuma kanna is for his nephew Panju Arunachalam, and so on.Will write more tonight.<br />Â <br />On the late Kunnakkudi, as Venkat said heÂ was never accepted and acknowledged by the classical music community - although he was very creative he was also an extremely good classical musician, occasionally even the hardenedcritic Subbudu acknowledged that.Salutations and may his soul rest in peace.Â <br /><br />--- On Tue, 9/9/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Tuesday, September 9, 2008, 11:52 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sathish,<br /><br /><br />Well said.

			<div class="content">Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his creations and<br />one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic classical or<br />western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum on Madai<br />Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but just to give you a<br />flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way: <br /><br />Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and discusses the tamil<br />song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression etc. I doubt it<br />will be of too much interest to people other than those who follow tamil<br />songs AND play some instrument..<br /><br />I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to the song "Madai<br />Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..<br /><br />I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is the original one<br />since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but it still works.<br />If this is not the original scale, you can always move it around.<br /><br />Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br /><br />A# C D D# F G A<br /><br />The corresponding chords are: <br /><br />A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br /><br />(I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found that it<br />usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to the chords).<br /><br />The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj Scale or the<br />Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale. (On the<br />fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones (half notes)<br />to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and chords remain<br />the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On second<br />thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call this the Gmin<br />Scale.<br /><br />Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion: <br /><br /><br />Dm Gm A# Dm<br />Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br /><br />Dm Gm A# Dm<br />Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br /><br />Dm Cm Gm<br />Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br /><br />Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br /><br />Intro - 1<br />---------<br /><br />Stanza - 1<br />==========<br /><br />Dm A# Gm A#<br />Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br /><br />Dm A# Gm A#<br />Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br /><br />Cm Cm Cm A#<br />Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br /><br />A# A# A# Cm<br />Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br /><br />Cm Dm<br />YenakkE thaan.<br /><br /><br /><br />The second stanza is similar.<br /><br />A few things to note: <br /><br />In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br /><br /><br />Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br /><br />I IV V<br /><br /><br />where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of the scale.<br /><br />1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves to the tonic (Gm)<br />at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this interesting because<br />usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually follow some<br />chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the end.<br /><br /><br />2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V (nice.. different<br />from the usual I-IV-V.<br /><br />3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the (Ninaiththathu<br />paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-V-IV-VII<br />resolving to I at the next stanza.<br /><br />4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before getting to<br />IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that. Creates a<br />certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I, which is<br />done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have found that<br />I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs where there are<br />scale changes... but thats for another day).<br /><br />5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix. Now this is<br />obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the Maestro that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />It creates a very nice effect.<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Sathish,<br /> <br />  Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!
