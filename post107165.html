He <br />    gradually <br />      conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within <br />the <br />      Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. <br />      <br />      He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />      political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />      backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to <br />grow <br />      steadily into an overseas empire. <br />      <br />      During this period in Miyanmar &#40;the former Burma&#41; there <br />existed <br />    two <br />      main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the region <br />      called Marammadesa &#40;the present central Miyanmar&#41; having the <br />    capital <br />      at Arimaddanapura &#40;the present Pagan&#41;, and the Talaing &#40;Mon&#41; <br />    kingdom <br />      of the region called Rammanadesa &#40;the present southern <br />Miyanmar <br />    also <br />      known as Arumanam in Tamil&#41; having its capital at Sudhammavati <br />    &#40;the <br />      present Thaton&#41;. The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />    medieval <br />      period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. <br />      <br />      While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />      Kyaungbyu &#40;A.D.984 -1006&#41; was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />      kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king Kyizo <br />      {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who <br />was <br />      ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period of <br />      Rajaraja - 1. <br />      <br />      During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />  with <br />      Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />    Rammanadesa <br />      being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" in <br />  the <br />      Tamil Nadu. <br />      <br />      Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} <br />      <br />      With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />  throne <br />      after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate &#40;A.D.1012-1037&#41; started <br />    rule <br />      in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />  Kyizo, <br />      and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />  &#40;A.D.?? ? <br />      1057&#41; ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. <br />      <br />      During this time there had been much sea traffic between these <br />  two <br />      countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />  trade <br />      with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa &#40;also known as <br />  Arumanam&#41; <br />      and the Mirammadesa. <br />      <br />      In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was <br />spreading <br />    it&#39;s <br />      authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />    Indonesia <br />      and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at one <br />    time <br />      a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />  South-<br />      East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer <br />hinderences <br />    to <br />      the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present <br />Miyanmar. <br />      <br />      Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force <br />in <br />      A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore the <br />    title <br />      as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East <br />Asia <br />      after capturing the Manakkavaram &#40;Great Nicobar Island&#41;, <br />reached <br />    the <br />      country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. <br />      <br />      They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam &#40;most possibly <br />  the <br />      present Dagon or Rangoon&#41;, and the interior capital city of <br />      Sudammavathi &#40;Thaton&#41; with "protected fortress walls" - of the <br />      Talaing &#40;Mon&#41; kingdom of Rammanadesa &#40;Arumanam&#41;, and defeated <br />  it&#39;s <br />      ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />  Rajendra <br />      Chola&#39;s forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. <br />      <br />      At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />      younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha &#40;A.D.1037-<br />  1079&#41; <br />    on <br />      the throne. <br />      <br />      Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} <br />      <br />      In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by <br />his <br />      eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />  Chola <br />      throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes <br />to <br />    the <br />      Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. <br />      <br />      Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} <br />      <br />      Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />  emperor <br />      Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. <br />      <br />      Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who <br />came <br />    to <br />      the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />  Miyanmar <br />      and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin <br />Arahan <br />    also <br />      informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the <br />Talaing <br />      kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />  also <br />      many sacred relics. <br />      <br />      King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent his <br />    wise <br />      minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha <br />requesting <br />    some <br />      copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with much <br />  ill <br />      reply. <br />      <br />      This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with king <br />      Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />  king <br />      Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family <br />to <br />      Arimaddanapura. <br />      <br />      From this year onwards the Rammanadesa became part of the <br />    Arimaddana <br />      empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />    appointed <br />      to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />      Tharehkiltara &#40;present Prome&#41; in the Pegu region as his new <br />    capital <br />      of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it&#39;s <br />      importance with it&#39;s destruction by his forces and with the <br />    capture <br />      of it&#39;s king Manuha. <br />      <br />      It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, and <br />  it <br />      coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />  viceroy <br />    to <br />      rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the <br />Cholas. <br />      <br />      There seems to have been no immediate response and retaliation <br />    from <br />      the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha&#39;s forces, <br />and <br />      which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. <br />      <br />      Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} <br />      <br />      Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />      Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this time <br />  the <br />      viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed by <br />  the <br />      Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. <br />      <br />      In this same period the king of Kadarem &#40;present Kedah region <br />of <br />      Malaysia&#41; with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling <br />king <br />    of <br />      Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of <br />Virarajendra <br />      Chola in regaining his kingdom. <br />      <br />      The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />      A.D.1068 under his nephew &#40;sister&#39;s son&#41; Kulothunga to help <br />the <br />    king <br />      of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />  his <br />      great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />      Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />      Tharehkiltara &#40;Prome&#41; and captured the Rammanadesa &#40;Arumanam&#41;. <br />      <br />      However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha <br />at <br />      Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to <br />Cholas <br />    and <br />      allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />      appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of Chola <br />      forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests <br />of <br />    the <br />      Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />    victory <br />      over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />      victory "jayastamba" at Prome. <br />      <br />      Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} <br />      <br />      In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />  son <br />      Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola <br />throne. <br />      <br />      During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 &#40;A.D.1059-1114&#41; of <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />    country <br />      from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, <br />few <br />      years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />      presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />      requesting for military assistance against Cholas. <br />      <br />      But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />    growing <br />      empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />  providing <br />      forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents <br />to <br />    him <br />      including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. <br />      <br />      Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />      <br />      Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, <br />which <br />      resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />  ascending <br />      the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. <br />      <br />      In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />      Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and <br />successfully <br />      expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />  period <br />    of <br />      nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half of <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />      title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor <br />the <br />      Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />      northern half of Sri Lanka. <br />      <br />      King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />      A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in the <br />      control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />    elderly <br />      Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />  books, <br />      and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this <br />request <br />    and <br />      sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who <br />instituted <br />  a <br />      Nikaya &#40;Sect&#41; known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism in <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka. <br />      <br />      Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />      Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />  rule <br />      the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />      stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />  However <br />      immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />    Kyanzittha <br />      also known as Tribuwanaditya&#41; &#40;A.D.1084-1112&#41;, who was also a <br />  son <br />    of <br />      Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from <br />Bengal - <br />      took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. <br />      <br />      At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha&#39;s forces returned <br />    back <br />      saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung and <br />  Nga <br />      Thon Pinle &#40;thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />    Traders <br />      and forces&#41; in the present Pegu division, and captured the <br />Tamil <br />      Chola &#40;Tamil Indian&#41; warriors stationed in this region, who <br />were <br />    now <br />      settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />    possibly <br />      under captivity. <br />      <br />      Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />  army <br />      under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />  avenge <br />      the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />      antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely <br />welcomed <br />      him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, and <br />    took <br />      time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />      apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. <br />      <br />      The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />      Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />      Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />  the <br />      Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola <br />prince <br />    and <br />      his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. <br />      <br />      It appears during this period with the newly builtup relations <br />  the <br />      traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the <br />Chola <br />      empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />      capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and they <br />    were <br />      also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without <br />any <br />      hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />      as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". <br />      <br />      Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana <br />Kulasekara <br />      Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram &#40;present Cranganore&#41; of the <br />      Malaimandalam &#40;the present Kerala state&#41; of South India - the <br />    former <br />      capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time under <br />  the <br />      rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa &#40;hall&#41;, gave <br />a <br />      sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly <br />in <br />    the <br />      mandapa of this temple. <br />      <br />      In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay tributes <br />  to <br />      the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung &#40;A.D.1101-1126&#41; of the Sung <br />  Empire. <br />      The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank and <br />      ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the <br />grand <br />      council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri <br />Vijaya. <br />      During the hsi-ning period &#40;A.D.1068-79&#41; imperial decrees were <br />      addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />      wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur&#41; is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />  look <br />      down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire <br />to <br />      adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih &#40;Arabs&#41;, <br />    Chiao-<br />      chih &#40;Annam&#41; etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees <br />were <br />    all <br />      written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and <br />stored <br />    in <br />      a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade <br />silk <br />      double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor <br />approved....." <br />      <br />      Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />      &#40;A.D.1112-1187&#41; on the Arimaddanapur throne. <br />      <br />      Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} & Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />      {A.D.1133-1150} <br />      <br />      It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had <br />with <br />      Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? <br />1, <br />      during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />  Chola ? <br />      2. <br />      <br />      Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} <br />      <br />      However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the <br />distant <br />      lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the Pappalam <br />  the <br />      seaport city of Rammanadesa. <br />      <br />      However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />  traffic <br />      on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar <br />kingdoms <br />    even <br />      thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />  being <br />      aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from <br />China, <br />    has <br />      to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />  Pukan <br />      &#40;Arimaddanapur&#41; kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />    trade <br />      activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. <br />      <br />      Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas <br />      <br />      Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of the <br />      Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />      Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. <br />      <br />      Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be <br />the <br />      overlord of the king of Poppalam &#40;Pappalam&#41;, and Sadaiyavarman <br />      Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received <br />tributes <br />    from <br />      Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country <br />is <br />      left out for further research study as it does not fall within <br />  the <br />      scope of the title of this essay.</div></blockquote></div>

He <br />      gradually <br />        conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within <br />  the <br />        Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. <br />        <br />        He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />        political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative <br />system <br />        backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to <br />  grow <br />        steadily into an overseas empire. <br />        <br />        During this period in Miyanmar &#40;the former Burma&#41; there <br />  existed <br />      two <br />        main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the <br />region <br />        called Marammadesa &#40;the present central Miyanmar&#41; having the <br />      capital <br />        at Arimaddanapura &#40;the present Pagan&#41;, and the Talaing &#40;Mon&#41; <br />      kingdom <br />        of the region called Rammanadesa &#40;the present southern <br />  Miyanmar <br />      also <br />        known as Arumanam in Tamil&#41; having its capital at <br />Sudhammavati <br />      &#40;the <br />        present Thaton&#41;. The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />      medieval <br />        period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. <br />        <br />        While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />        Kyaungbyu &#40;A.D.984 -1006&#41; was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />        kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king <br />Kyizo <br />        {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who <br />  was <br />        ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period <br />of <br />        Rajaraja - 1. <br />        <br />        During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />    with <br />        Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />      Rammanadesa <br />        being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" <br />in <br />    the <br />        Tamil Nadu. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} <br />        <br />        With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />    throne <br />        after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate &#40;A.D.1012-1037&#41; <br />started <br />      rule <br />        in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />    Kyizo, <br />        and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />    &#40;A.D.?? ? <br />        1057&#41; ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. <br />        <br />        During this time there had been much sea traffic between <br />these <br />    two <br />        countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />    trade <br />        with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa &#40;also known as <br />    Arumanam&#41; <br />        and the Mirammadesa. <br />        <br />        In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was <br />  spreading <br />      it&#39;s <br />        authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />      Indonesia <br />        and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at <br />one <br />      time <br />        a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />    South-<br />        East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer <br />  hinderences <br />      to <br />        the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present <br />  Miyanmar. <br />        <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force <br />  in <br />        A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore <br />the <br />      title <br />        as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East <br />  Asia <br />        after capturing the Manakkavaram &#40;Great Nicobar Island&#41;, <br />  reached <br />      the <br />        country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. <br />        <br />        They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam &#40;most possibly <br />    the <br />        present Dagon or Rangoon&#41;, and the interior capital city of <br />        Sudammavathi &#40;Thaton&#41; with "protected fortress walls" - of <br />the <br />        Talaing &#40;Mon&#41; kingdom of Rammanadesa &#40;Arumanam&#41;, and defeated <br />    it&#39;s <br />        ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />    Rajendra <br />        Chola&#39;s forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. <br />        <br />        At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />        younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha &#40;A.D.1037-<br />    1079&#41; <br />      on <br />        the throne. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} <br />        <br />        In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by <br />  his <br />        eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />    Chola <br />        throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes <br />  to <br />      the <br />        Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} <br />        <br />        Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />    emperor <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. <br />        <br />        Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who <br />  came <br />      to <br />        the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />    Miyanmar <br />        and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin <br />  Arahan <br />      also <br />        informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the <br />  Talaing <br />        kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />    also <br />        many sacred relics. <br />        <br />        King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent <br />his <br />      wise <br />        minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha <br />  requesting <br />      some <br />        copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with <br />much <br />    ill <br />        reply. <br />        <br />        This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with <br />king <br />        Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />    king <br />        Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family <br />  to <br />        Arimaddanapura. <br />        <br />        From this year onwards the Rammanadesa became part of the <br />      Arimaddana <br />        empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />      appointed <br />        to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />        Tharehkiltara &#40;present Prome&#41; in the Pegu region as his new <br />      capital <br />        of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it&#39;s <br />        importance with it&#39;s destruction by his forces and with the <br />      capture <br />        of it&#39;s king Manuha. <br />        <br />        It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, <br />and <br />    it <br />        coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />    viceroy <br />      to <br />        rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the <br />  Cholas. <br />        <br />        There seems to have been no immediate response and <br />retaliation <br />      from <br />        the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha&#39;s forces, <br />  and <br />        which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. <br />        <br />        Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} <br />        <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother <br />emperor <br />        Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this <br />time <br />    the <br />        viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed <br />by <br />    the <br />        Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. <br />        <br />        In this same period the king of Kadarem &#40;present Kedah region <br />  of <br />        Malaysia&#41; with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling <br />  king <br />      of <br />        Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of <br />  Virarajendra <br />        Chola in regaining his kingdom. <br />        <br />        The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />        A.D.1068 under his nephew &#40;sister&#39;s son&#41; Kulothunga to help <br />  the <br />      king <br />        of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />    his <br />        great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />        Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />        Tharehkiltara &#40;Prome&#41; and captured the Rammanadesa <br />&#40;Arumanam&#41;. <br />        <br />        However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha <br />  at <br />        Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to <br />  Cholas <br />      and <br />        allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />        appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of <br />Chola <br />        forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests <br />  of <br />      the <br />        Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />      victory <br />        over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />        victory "jayastamba" at Prome. <br />        <br />        Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} <br />        <br />        In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />    son <br />        Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola <br />  throne. <br />        <br />        During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 &#40;A.D.1059-1114&#41; of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />      country <br />        from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, <br />  few <br />        years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />        presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />        requesting for military assistance against Cholas. <br />        <br />        But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />      growing <br />        empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />    providing <br />        forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents <br />  to <br />      him <br />        including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. <br />        <br />        Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />        <br />        Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, <br />  which <br />        resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />    ascending <br />        the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. <br />        <br />        In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />        Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and <br />  successfully <br />        expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />    period <br />      of <br />        nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half <br />of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />        title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor <br />  the <br />        Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />        northern half of Sri Lanka. <br />        <br />        King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />        A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in <br />the <br />        control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />      elderly <br />        Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />    books, <br />        and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this <br />  request <br />      and <br />        sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who <br />  instituted <br />    a <br />        Nikaya &#40;Sect&#41; known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism <br />in <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. <br />        <br />        Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />        Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />    rule <br />        the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />        stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />    However <br />        immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />      Kyanzittha <br />        also known as Tribuwanaditya&#41; &#40;A.D.1084-1112&#41;, who was also a <br />    son <br />      of <br />        Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from <br />  Bengal - <br />        took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. <br />        <br />        At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha&#39;s forces <br />returned <br />      back <br />        saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung <br />and <br />    Nga <br />        Thon Pinle &#40;thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />      Traders <br />        and forces&#41; in the present Pegu division, and captured the <br />  Tamil <br />        Chola &#40;Tamil Indian&#41; warriors stationed in this region, who <br />  were <br />      now <br />        settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />      possibly <br />        under captivity. <br />        <br />        Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />    army <br />        under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />    avenge <br />        the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />        antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely <br />  welcomed <br />        him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, <br />and <br />      took <br />        time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />        apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. <br />        <br />        The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />        Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />        Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />    the <br />        Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola <br />  prince <br />      and <br />        his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. <br />        <br />        It appears during this period with the newly builtup <br />relations <br />    the <br />        traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the <br />  Chola <br />        empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />        capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and <br />they <br />      were <br />        also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without <br />  any <br />        hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />        as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". <br />        <br />        Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana <br />  Kulasekara <br />        Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram &#40;present Cranganore&#41; of the <br />        Malaimandalam &#40;the present Kerala state&#41; of South India - the <br />      former <br />        capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time <br />under <br />    the <br />        rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa &#40;hall&#41;, <br />gave <br />  a <br />        sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly <br />  in <br />      the <br />        mandapa of this temple. <br />        <br />        In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay <br />tributes <br />    to <br />        the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung &#40;A.D.1101-1126&#41; of the Sung <br />    Empire. <br />        The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank <br />and <br />        ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the <br />  grand <br />        council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri <br />  Vijaya. <br />        During the hsi-ning period &#40;A.D.1068-79&#41; imperial decrees <br />were <br />        addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />        wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur&#41; is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />    look <br />        down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire <br />  to <br />        adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih <br />&#40;Arabs&#41;, <br />      Chiao-<br />        chih &#40;Annam&#41; etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees <br />  were <br />      all <br />        written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and <br />  stored <br />      in <br />        a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade <br />  silk <br />        double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor <br />  approved....." <br />        <br />        Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />        &#40;A.D.1112-1187&#41; on the Arimaddanapur throne. <br />        <br />        Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} & Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />        {A.D.1133-1150} <br />        <br />        It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had <br />  with <br />        Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? <br />  1, <br />        during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />    Chola ? <br />        2. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} <br />        <br />        However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the <br />  distant <br />        lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the <br />Pappalam <br />    the <br />        seaport city of Rammanadesa. <br />        <br />        However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />    traffic <br />        on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar <br />  kingdoms <br />      even <br />        thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />    being <br />        aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from <br />  China, <br />      has <br />        to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />    Pukan <br />        &#40;Arimaddanapur&#41; kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />      trade <br />        activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. <br />        <br />        Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas <br />        <br />        Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of <br />the <br />        Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />        Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. <br />        <br />        Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be <br />  the <br />        overlord of the king of Poppalam &#40;Pappalam&#41;, and <br />Sadaiyavarman <br />        Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received <br />  tributes <br />      from <br />        Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country <br />  is <br />        left out for further research study as it does not fall <br />within <br />    the <br />        scope of the title of this essay.</div></blockquote></div>

He <br />      gradually <br />        conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within <br />  the <br />        Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. <br />        <br />        He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />        political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative <br />system <br />        backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to <br />  grow <br />        steadily into an overseas empire. <br />        <br />        During this period in Miyanmar &#40;the former Burma&#41; there <br />  existed <br />      two <br />        main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the <br />region <br />        called Marammadesa &#40;the present central Miyanmar&#41; having the <br />      capital <br />        at Arimaddanapura &#40;the present Pagan&#41;, and the Talaing &#40;Mon&#41; <br />      kingdom <br />        of the region called Rammanadesa &#40;the present southern <br />  Miyanmar <br />      also <br />        known as Arumanam in Tamil&#41; having its capital at <br />Sudhammavati <br />      &#40;the <br />        present Thaton&#41;. The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />      medieval <br />        period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. <br />        <br />        While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />        Kyaungbyu &#40;A.D.984 -1006&#41; was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />        kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king <br />Kyizo <br />        {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who <br />  was <br />        ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period <br />of <br />        Rajaraja - 1. <br />        <br />        During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />    with <br />        Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />      Rammanadesa <br />        being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" <br />in <br />    the <br />        Tamil Nadu. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} <br />        <br />        With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />    throne <br />        after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate &#40;A.D.1012-1037&#41; <br />started <br />      rule <br />        in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />    Kyizo, <br />        and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />    &#40;A.D.?? ? <br />        1057&#41; ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. <br />        <br />        During this time there had been much sea traffic between <br />these <br />    two <br />        countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />    trade <br />        with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa &#40;also known as <br />    Arumanam&#41; <br />        and the Mirammadesa. <br />        <br />        In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was <br />  spreading <br />      it&#39;s <br />        authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />      Indonesia <br />        and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at <br />one <br />      time <br />        a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />    South-<br />        East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer <br />  hinderences <br />      to <br />        the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present <br />  Miyanmar. <br />        <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force <br />  in <br />        A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore <br />the <br />      title <br />        as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East <br />  Asia <br />        after capturing the Manakkavaram &#40;Great Nicobar Island&#41;, <br />  reached <br />      the <br />        country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. <br />        <br />        They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam &#40;most possibly <br />    the <br />        present Dagon or Rangoon&#41;, and the interior capital city of <br />        Sudammavathi &#40;Thaton&#41; with "protected fortress walls" - of <br />the <br />        Talaing &#40;Mon&#41; kingdom of Rammanadesa &#40;Arumanam&#41;, and defeated <br />    it&#39;s <br />        ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />    Rajendra <br />        Chola&#39;s forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. <br />        <br />        At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />        younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha &#40;A.D.1037-<br />    1079&#41; <br />      on <br />        the throne. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} <br />        <br />        In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by <br />  his <br />        eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />    Chola <br />        throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes <br />  to <br />      the <br />        Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} <br />        <br />        Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />    emperor <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. <br />        <br />        Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who <br />  came <br />      to <br />        the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />    Miyanmar <br />        and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin <br />  Arahan <br />      also <br />        informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the <br />  Talaing <br />        kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />    also <br />        many sacred relics. <br />        <br />        King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent <br />his <br />      wise <br />        minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha <br />  requesting <br />      some <br />        copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with <br />much <br />    ill <br />        reply. <br />        <br />        This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with <br />king <br />        Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />    king <br />        Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family <br />  to <br />        Arimaddanapura. <br />        <br />        From this year onwards the Rammanadesa became part of the <br />      Arimaddana <br />        empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />      appointed <br />        to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />        Tharehkiltara &#40;present Prome&#41; in the Pegu region as his new <br />      capital <br />        of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it&#39;s <br />        importance with it&#39;s destruction by his forces and with the <br />      capture <br />        of it&#39;s king Manuha. <br />        <br />        It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, <br />and <br />    it <br />        coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />    viceroy <br />      to <br />        rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the <br />  Cholas. <br />        <br />        There seems to have been no immediate response and <br />retaliation <br />      from <br />        the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha&#39;s forces, <br />  and <br />        which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. <br />        <br />        Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} <br />        <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother <br />emperor <br />        Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this <br />time <br />    the <br />        viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed <br />by <br />    the <br />        Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. <br />        <br />        In this same period the king of Kadarem &#40;present Kedah region <br />  of <br />        Malaysia&#41; with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling <br />  king <br />      of <br />        Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of <br />  Virarajendra <br />        Chola in regaining his kingdom. <br />        <br />        The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />        A.D.1068 under his nephew &#40;sister&#39;s son&#41; Kulothunga to help <br />  the <br />      king <br />        of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />    his <br />        great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />        Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />        Tharehkiltara &#40;Prome&#41; and captured the Rammanadesa <br />&#40;Arumanam&#41;. <br />        <br />        However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha <br />  at <br />        Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to <br />  Cholas <br />      and <br />        allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />        appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of <br />Chola <br />        forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests <br />  of <br />      the <br />        Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />      victory <br />        over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />        victory "jayastamba" at Prome. <br />        <br />        Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} <br />        <br />        In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />    son <br />        Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola <br />  throne. <br />        <br />        During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 &#40;A.D.1059-1114&#41; of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />      country <br />        from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, <br />  few <br />        years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />        presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />        requesting for military assistance against Cholas. <br />        <br />        But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />      growing <br />        empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />    providing <br />        forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents <br />  to <br />      him <br />        including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. <br />        <br />        Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />        <br />        Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, <br />  which <br />        resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />    ascending <br />        the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. <br />        <br />        In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />        Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and <br />  successfully <br />        expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />    period <br />      of <br />        nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half <br />of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />        title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor <br />  the <br />        Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />        northern half of Sri Lanka. <br />        <br />        King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />        A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in <br />the <br />        control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />      elderly <br />        Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />    books, <br />        and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this <br />  request <br />      and <br />        sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who <br />  instituted <br />    a <br />        Nikaya &#40;Sect&#41; known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism <br />in <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. <br />        <br />        Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />        Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />    rule <br />        the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />        stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />    However <br />        immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />      Kyanzittha <br />        also known as Tribuwanaditya&#41; &#40;A.D.1084-1112&#41;, who was also a <br />    son <br />      of <br />        Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from <br />  Bengal - <br />        took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. <br />        <br />        At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha&#39;s forces <br />returned <br />      back <br />        saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung <br />and <br />    Nga <br />        Thon Pinle &#40;thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />      Traders <br />        and forces&#41; in the present Pegu division, and captured the <br />  Tamil <br />        Chola &#40;Tamil Indian&#41; warriors stationed in this region, who <br />  were <br />      now <br />        settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />      possibly <br />        under captivity. <br />        <br />        Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />    army <br />        under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />    avenge <br />        the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />        antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely <br />  welcomed <br />        him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, <br />and <br />      took <br />        time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />        apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. <br />        <br />        The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />        Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />        Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />    the <br />        Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola <br />  prince <br />      and <br />        his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. <br />        <br />        It appears during this period with the newly builtup <br />relations <br />    the <br />        traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the <br />  Chola <br />        empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />        capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and <br />they <br />      were <br />        also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without <br />  any <br />        hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />        as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". <br />        <br />        Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana <br />  Kulasekara <br />        Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram &#40;present Cranganore&#41; of the <br />        Malaimandalam &#40;the present Kerala state&#41; of South India - the <br />      former <br />        capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time <br />under <br />    the <br />        rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa &#40;hall&#41;, <br />gave <br />  a <br />        sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly <br />  in <br />      the <br />        mandapa of this temple. <br />        <br />        In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay <br />tributes <br />    to <br />        the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung &#40;A.D.1101-1126&#41; of the Sung <br />    Empire. <br />        The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank <br />and <br />        ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the <br />  grand <br />        council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri <br />  Vijaya. <br />        During the hsi-ning period &#40;A.D.1068-79&#41; imperial decrees <br />were <br />        addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />        wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur&#41; is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />    look <br />        down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire <br />  to <br />        adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih <br />&#40;Arabs&#41;, <br />      Chiao-<br />        chih &#40;Annam&#41; etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees <br />  were <br />      all <br />        written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and <br />  stored <br />      in <br />        a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade <br />  silk <br />        double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor <br />  approved....." <br />        <br />        Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />        &#40;A.D.1112-1187&#41; on the Arimaddanapur throne. <br />        <br />        Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} & Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />        {A.D.1133-1150} <br />        <br />        It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had <br />  with <br />        Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? <br />  1, <br />        during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />    Chola ? <br />        2. <br />        <br />        Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} <br />        <br />        However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the <br />  distant <br />        lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the <br />Pappalam <br />    the <br />        seaport city of Rammanadesa. <br />        <br />        However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />    traffic <br />        on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar <br />  kingdoms <br />      even <br />        thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />    being <br />        aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from <br />  China, <br />      has <br />        to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />    Pukan <br />        &#40;Arimaddanapur&#41; kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />      trade <br />        activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. <br />        <br />        Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas <br />        <br />        Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of <br />the <br />        Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />        Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. <br />        <br />        Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be <br />  the <br />        overlord of the king of Poppalam &#40;Pappalam&#41;, and <br />Sadaiyavarman <br />        Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received <br />  tributes <br />      from <br />        Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country <br />  is <br />        left out for further research study as it does not fall <br />within <br />    the <br />        scope of the title of this essay.</div></blockquote></div>
