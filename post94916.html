			<div class="content">Dear SPS,<br /><br />Yes you are correct in saying that we are influenced by the outsiders<br />and got spoiled to the core. Politics in India is at its worst.<br />Kamaraj and Kakkan are mere dreams for the present and forthcoming<br />generations. Often I used to feel that Indians have adopted all the<br />bad qualities from the west and neglected the goods in them. Where as<br />the westerners are slowly attracted to the Indian culture and<br />adopting our lifestyle. It wont be a surprise if after 100 years<br />someone in US would have patented the ayurvedha, Yogasanas(to some<br />extent Yoga is already patented in the US),siddha and copyrighted<br />the vedas and upanishads as they have patented needm, basmathi etc.<br />They are probing into each and every aspect of Indian history,<br />tradition, culture,values etc. which really makes us Proud. But on<br />the other hand we Indians take up their style and the youngsters are<br />crazy of discotheques, bars,pubs, dating, divorce, etc etc..10 years<br />back drinking was considered bad. Today smoking and drinking are not<br />considered bad in our society. New terminologies have evolved for<br />substanciating it - 'Socializing'..I am afraid where the country is<br />going. I have taught on this and tried to find an answer many a<br />times, but at last I was convinced with only one point which answers<br />or rather was answered in great detail in our ancient scripts -<br />"KALIYUGAM". Only this word convinces me for all the happenings.<br />So if this is what the great lord, the master of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the master of<br />all of us - brahadeeswara has written the screenplay as, no one can<br />change it.<br /><br />I think I have deviated the topic a lot. Ok. Coming the Tiruvaranga<br />Ula..yes its really touching to hear about these. Many a things are<br />not know to all. Ranga was very much popular and being a kshetram<br />this story is quite know to the masses. but there are several other<br />such instances. People belonging to the North Arcot district might<br />know this. My native, or rather my parents naitve is Vellore. Though<br />our native is a kukgramam named Kadaladi near polur, we generally say<br />vellore is our Native. Though I dont go there often, when I visit<br />occasionally the 'Jalakanteswarar' temple, popularly know as 'Kotai<br />Koil' because it is situated inside a big fort, I forget myself<br />seeing the beauty of the lord Jalakanteswara. There is a big temple<br />inside the fort premisis. The fort is a beauty to watch and I think<br />its built by the vijayanagara kings.The sculptures are a boon to<br />watch. The kalyana mandapam is so beautiful that the britishers<br />wanted to take it to England and even marked every piece of the stone<br />to disassemble and reassemble it. But fortunately the ship which was<br />coming to India to take this masterpiece wrecked and drowned in the<br />sea and hence the idea was discarded. Probably this could also be a<br />place for us to visit.My father told me the story that, during the<br />muslim invastion the muslim rulers planned to destroy the temple and<br />fearing it the lingam was moved away from the temple. Its said that<br />the lingam was protected by a family in Sathuvachari, near vellore<br />for more than 150 years without anyone knowledge. In 1980's the then<br />collected Belliappa wanted to bring the lingam back and after a great<br />struggle the lingam was brought back to the temple and donations were<br />collected to renovate the temple. Thus the lord was hiding without<br />any pooja for nearly 150-200 years.<br /><br />Another incident in Dindigul,near Madurai. There is a famous Abirami<br />Amman temple. The beauty is, this temple has two god and two<br />godesses. Abirami amman and Padmagirisan, Gnanambikai and I forgot<br />the lords name. Why because, it was originally Gnanmbikai and the<br />lord and Abirami and Padmagirisan were at the fort atop the hill.<br />Tipu sultan, as usual wanted to destroy the temple and pushed the<br />lord and goddess from the hilltop. Since it has to be kept somewhere,<br />the people protected it in the temple below and they got the<br />prominance sidelining the original ambal and lord. So I think there<br />are several stories around the country like this. Dadikombu near<br />Dindigul is a visual treat. The perumal koil mandapam has life size<br />sculptures(nearly a dozen) which needs 1000 eyes to watch. Such a<br />beautiful and lively sirpams.<br /><br />The concept of organising Tamil Nadu history is a great one. I think<br />the whole group will be interested to read that. Either it can be<br />topic in the group mail,or an article in varalaaru.com. Again I get<br />back to my earlier suggestion. Can we go from a macro view to the<br />micro level. Meaning, instead of going by chronological order and<br />going through the details at every stage, wont it be beneficial if we<br />get a macro view of the history from the sangam period till date and<br />then go through the details one by one. This is just my suggestion,<br />becuase if we keep on repeating the same thing again and again, it<br />becomes easier to remember, rather than reading one at a time. This<br />is nothing but our Kalki's style. In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> he keeps on reapeating whose<br />son is who and who did what on and off so that we get the perfect<br />sequence. Its just a suggestion and if feasible, the researchers can<br />think on it.<br /><br />I think I have taken up lot of your time and sorry for the same.<br />Catch you all soon.<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Satish,<br />I just couldn't believe Tipu Sultan wanted to destroy a temple. He is<br />said to be a scholar in both Hinduism and Islam and respected both<br />religions equally. <br />I didn't derive this info from the "Sword of Tipu Sultan" but had read<br />it in some article. <br />When he was in hide out, he used to eat the prasadam from the<br />Srirangappattanam temple and has done so many iriyilis to that temple. <br />Just can't believe that, he tried to destroy a temple in Dindigul.<br />Atleast he stood out differently from others, who embarked on<br />demolishing temples.<br /><br /><br />There is another story, related to Nellai Appar kovil in Tirunelveli.<br />Actually this temple gives equal importance to both Partvati & Shiva.<br />Both sannathis are big enough.<br />There is a small sannathi called Anavathar Sannathi. Actually he is no<br />god, but an actualy human being, who lived some 200-250 years ago. His<br />name was Anwar-Ud-Din. He has also given a lot of donations and iraiyili<br />to the temple. So the temple authorities in those days, have opened a<br />sannathi for him and the name "Anwar-ud-din" became Anavarathar.<br /><br />Also there is a place called 'Murugan kurichi' in Tirunelveli (it still<br />exists). Not so many know that the idol of the "Tiruchendur murugan (I<br />am not sure, whether it was the ursavar or the moolavar)" was kept there<br />for some months by the dutch, when they tried to smuggle the statue to<br />Holland. It so happened that the ship they carried the idol sunk in the<br />sea and I believe the rest of story is known to all.<br /><br /><br />Rgds,<br />Vijay<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@...] <br />Sent: Friday, November 05, 2004 11:25 AM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear SPS,<br /><br />Yes you are correct in saying that we are influenced by the outsiders <br />and got spoiled to the core.

			<div class="content">Hi Vijay,<br /><br />Yes, many Indians like you and some years back even I, belive that<br />Tipu Sultan was neutral and was a great patriot. He fought against<br />the british for freedom etc. etc. As I wrote earlier, thanks to the<br />congress, communist and erstwhile 'secularists' of India,the history<br />which we read are not correct. Tipu Sultan is no great hero as we see<br />him nor he is not different from any other Muslim Ruler. (I am not<br />creting a thread on Relion or secularism or religions tolerance etc.<br />But just talking History). He has demolished thousands of Temples in<br />Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil nadu. While doing all these atrocities,<br />it seems one astrologer told him that he has done a great lot of sins<br />and if he touch Srirangapatnam temple, he is doomed. So to do<br />prayachitam for his sins he has to give irailis to Srirangapatnam<br />temple and thats why he left that temple alone. He has killed 10lakh<br />hindus in Kerala Tamil nadu border alone. Through out his province he<br />has killed millions of Hindus who refused to convert to Islam and has<br />forced millions to get converted to Isalm. Probably the story of him<br />eating koil prasadam is, pasi vandha pattum parandhu pogum. correcta.<br /><br />Just another titbit. In the world arena people talk about the<br />homicide done by the German against the Jews. Till date lots of<br />exhibitions are conducted to remind us of the jews fate. You know one<br />thing, in the entire world, if any one community has underwent<br />harrassment from another country, it is the attrocities committed by<br />the Muslim Rulers against Hindus in the past 10 decades. The number<br />runs in Millions and may be even to Billion. In kashmir alone in just<br />one decade 4 million hindus have been killed. An entire community has<br />been erased from kashmir valley. The largest ever Homicide is the<br />killing of Hindus by the Muslim rulers in the past. But these facts<br />are not revelied because India is SECULAR..hahaha..and our<br />Governments will always encourage this because they are Secular...<br /><br />Tipu fought against british not because he was a patriot and wanted<br />to Save india from foreign clutches. If he had thought so he would<br />not have joined hands with French to fight british. I think French<br />are also foreigners..haha..as any other king he wanted power and<br />wanted to rule his province and thats why he fought against the<br />British joining hands with French. If he was against foreigners<br />invasion, he would not have entertained French.<br /><br />So we should not get carried away by what we read and hear as Indian<br />History. As SPS correctly said, we have to reinvent our History.<br /><br />I think even before climbing the Sabari Malai, people go to vavar<br />masudhi at the foot hill..exceptions are always there my friend.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">How to have true, unbiased, balanced and real history?<br />Is it not basic right of any individual?<br />But, is it practicable.<br /><br />Following is an article i have come across is another example, I dont have any comment on this but its for information:<br /><br />Real History of "Taj Mahal"<br />"The Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal built the Taj Mahal. It was built in 22 years (1631 to 1653) by 20,000 artisans brought to India from all over the world! . Many people believe Ustad Isa of Iran designed it." This is what your guide possibly told you if you ever visited the Taj Mahal. This is the same story I read in my history book as a student.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>NOW READ THIS.......<br />No one has ever challenged it except Prof. P. N. Oak, who believes the whole world has been duped. In his book Taj Mahal: The True Story, Oak says the Taj Mahal is not Queen Mumtaz&#39;s tomb but an ancient Hindu temple palace of Lord Shiva &#40;then known as Tejo Mahalaya&#41;. In the course of his research Oak discovered that the Shiva temple palace was usurped by Shah Jahan from then Maharaja of Jaipur, Jai Singh. In his own court chronicle, Badshahnama, Shah Jahan admits that an exceptionally beautiful grand mansion in Agra was taken from Jai SIngh for Mumtaz&#39;s burial. The ex-Maharaja of Jaipur still retains in his secret collection two orders from Shah Jahan for surrendering the Taj building. Using captured temples and mansions, as a burial place ! for</div></blockquote>dead courtiers and royalty was a common practice among Muslim<br />rulers.<br />For example, Humayun,Akbar, Etmud-ud-Daula and Safdarjung are all<br />buried in such mansions. Oak's inquiries began with the name of Taj Mahal. He says the term "Mahal" has never been used for a building i n any Muslim countries from Afghanisthan to Algeria. "The unusual explanation that the term Taj Mahal derives from Mumtaz Mahal was illogical in atleast two respects.<br /><br />Firstly, her name was never Mumtaz Mahal but Mumtaz-ul-Zamani," he<br />writes.<br />Secondly, one cannot omit the first three letters 'Mum' from a woman's name to derive the remainder as the name for the building."Taj Mahal, he claims, is a corrupt version of Tejo Mahalaya, or Lord Shiva's Palace. Oak also says the love story of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan is a fairy tale created by court sycophants, blundering historians and sloppy archaeologists.<br />Not a single royal chronicle of Shah Jahan's time corroborates the love<br />story.<br />Furthermore, Oak cites several documents suggesting the Taj Mahal<br />predates Shah Jahan's era, and was a temple dedicated to Shiva, worshipped by Rajputs of Agra city. For example, Prof. Marvin Miller of New York took a few samples from the riverside doorway of the Taj. Carbon dating tests revealed that the door was 300 years older than Shah Jahan. European traveler Johan Albert Mandelslo,who visited Agra in 1638 (only seven years after Mumtaz's death), describes the life of the city in his memoirs. But he makes no reference to the Taj Mahal being built. The writings of Peter Mundy, an English visitor to < /SPAN Agra within a year of Mumtaz's death, also suggest the<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Taj was a noteworthy building well before Shah Jahan&#39;s time.<br />  <br />  <br />   Prof. Oak points out a number of design and architectural<br />   inconsistencies<br />  <br />   that support the belief of the Taj Mahal being a typical Hindu<br />   temple rather<br />  <br />   than a mausoleum.Many rooms in the Taj ! Mahal have remained sealed<br />   since Shah<br />  <br />   Jahan&#39;s time and are still inaccessible to the public. Oak asserts<br />   they<br />  <br />   contain a headless statue of Lord Shiva and other objects commonly<br />   used for<br />  <br />   worship rituals in Hindu temples. Fearing political backlash, Indira<br />  <br />   Gandhi&#39;s government tried to have Prof. Oak&#39;s b ook withdrawn from<br />the<br />  <br />   bookstores, and threatened the Indian publisher of the first edition<br />   dire<br />  <br />   consequences. There is only one way to discredit or validate Oak&#39;s<br />   research.<br />  <br />  <br />   The current government should open the sealed rooms of the Taj Mahal<br />   under<br />  <br />   U.N. supervision, and let international experts investigate.</div></blockquote><br /><br />SatishKumar Arunachalam  wrote:<br /><br />Hi Vijay,<br /><br />Yes, many Indians like you and some years back even I, belive that<br />Tipu Sultan was neutral and was a great patriot. He fought against<br />the british for freedom etc. etc. As I wrote earlier, thanks to the<br />congress, communist and erstwhile 'secularists' of India,the history<br />which we read are not correct. Tipu Sultan is no great hero as we see<br />him nor he is not different from any other Muslim Ruler. (I am not<br />creting a thread on Relion or secularism or religions tolerance etc.<br />But just talking History). He has demolished thousands of Temples in<br />Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil nadu. While doing all these atrocities,<br />it seems one astrologer told him that he has done a great lot of sins<br />and if he touch Srirangapatnam temple, he is doomed. So to do<br />prayachitam for his sins he has to give irailis to Srirangapatnam<br />temple and thats why he left that temple alone. He has killed 10lakh<br />hindus in Kerala Tamil nadu border alone. Through out his province he<br />has killed millions of Hindus who refused to convert to Islam and has<br />forced millions to get converted to Isalm. Probably the story of him<br />eating koil prasadam is, pasi vandha pattum parandhu pogum. correcta.<br /><br />Just another titbit. In the world arena people talk about the<br />homicide done by the German against the Jews. Till date lots of<br />exhibitions are conducted to remind us of the jews fate. You know one<br />thing, in the entire world, if any one community has underwent<br />harrassment from another country, it is the attrocities committed by<br />the Muslim Rulers against Hindus in the past 10 decades. The number<br />runs in Millions and may be even to Billion. In kashmir alone in just<br />one decade 4 million hindus have been killed. An entire community has<br />been erased from kashmir valley. The largest ever Homicide is the<br />killing of Hindus by the Muslim rulers in the past. But these facts<br />are not revelied because India is SECULAR..hahaha..and our<br />Governments will always encourage this because they are Secular...<br /><br />Tipu fought against british not because he was a patriot and wanted<br />to Save india from foreign clutches. If he had thought so he would<br />not have joined hands with French to fight british. I think French<br />are also foreigners..haha..as any other king he wanted power and<br />wanted to rule his province and thats why he fought against the<br />British joining hands with French. If he was against foreigners<br />invasion, he would not have entertained French.<br /><br />So we should not get carried away by what we read and hear as Indian<br />History. As SPS correctly said, we have to reinvent our History.<br /><br />I think even before climbing the Sabari Malai, people go to vavar<br />masudhi at the foot hill..exceptions are always there my friend.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi Niranjan,<br /><br />Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her<br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so<br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will<br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India.<br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we<br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you<br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to<br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending<br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during<br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our<br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita,<br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about<br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi'<br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions<br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should<br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the<br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool<br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br /><br />As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never<br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against<br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want<br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a<br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it<br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000<br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our<br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the<br />media which does this for their benefit.<br /><br />All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the<br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> at the Ayodhya<br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news<br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in<br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for<br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed<br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the<br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They<br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and<br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang<br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that<br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It<br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been<br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a<br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make<br />the news transparent?<br /><br />Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage<br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I<br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have<br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious<br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If<br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right.<br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best<br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra<br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were<br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and<br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a<br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the<br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create<br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The<br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three<br />weeks back from the police custody.<br /><br />The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated<br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by<br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and<br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt<br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even<br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and<br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest<br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group<br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can<br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal<br />satisfaction.

Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write<br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them.<br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to<br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I<br />write in this group.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br />**************<br /><br />This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.<br /><br />Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.<br /><br />Sorry to post an irrelevant message to the group.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br />ADI Support<br />*(91-44-22623880 # 6736)<br />*kshanmug@...<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@...]<br />Sent: Monday, November 08, 2004 12:47 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Niranjan,<br /><br />Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her<br />country's true history.

			<div class="content">Its true Kamal. But, you know if somebody worshiped like "the only great soul" who brought pahutharivu and vilippunarchi, then people who knows little more about history will definitely provoke that.<br /><br />Points of Sathish are just like that.<br /><br />By giving much biased worship to EVK, we forget services of Subramania siva, Swaminathan, Bharathiar, CHithambaram, Rajaji and Kalki and many more are there who sacrificed their life for this Tamil & Tamil nadu. We easiliy avoiding/forget them. You know why? the media and mass are with them. They grow hatred. They divide the people for their political gain.<br /><br />Sathishs views are understandablr. Its not kind of hatred. And in the same time you are also correct.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"Shanmugam, Kamalakkannan (MLODC, Covansys - CHENNAI)"  wrote:<br /><br />**************<br />The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br />**************<br /><br />This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.<br /><br />Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.<br /><br />Sorry to post an irrelevant message to the group.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br />ADI Support<br />*(91-44-22623880 # 6736)<br />*kshanmug@...<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@...]<br />Sent: Monday, November 08, 2004 12:47 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Niranjan,<br /><br />Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her<br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so<br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will<br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India.<br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we<br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you<br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to<br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending<br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during<br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our<br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita,<br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about<br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi'<br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions<br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should<br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the<br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool<br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br /><br />As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never<br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against<br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want<br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a<br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it<br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000<br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our<br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the<br />media which does this for their benefit.<br /><br />All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the<br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> at the Ayodhya<br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news<br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in<br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for<br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed<br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the<br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They<br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and<br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang<br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that<br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It<br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been<br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a<br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make<br />the news transparent?<br /><br />Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage<br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I<br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have<br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious<br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If<br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right.<br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best<br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra<br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were<br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and<br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a<br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the<br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create<br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The<br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three<br />weeks back from the police custody.<br /><br />The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated<br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by<br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and<br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt<br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even<br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and<br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest<br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group<br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can<br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal<br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in<br />the official published prints.<br /><br />The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating<br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might<br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished,<br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple.<br /><br />Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by<br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write<br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them.<br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to<br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I<br />write in this group.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!
