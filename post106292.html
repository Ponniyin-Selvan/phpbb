Once when he<br />      was walking <br />      through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of<br />      Srirangam were <br />      playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />      seeing Ramanuja <br />      called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this<br />      prasAdham of your <br />      beloved PerumAL".

If members are willing, I can share it<br />          here. Ofcourse, it is<br />            subject to a debate.<br />           <br />            Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />      lived<br />          for 120 years. He<br />            attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />      These<br />          are the timelines<br />            which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />           <br />            Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />      no<br />          link to the<br />            Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />          happened later, though<br />            within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />      right in<br />          saying that<br />            Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />          from the sea and got<br />            it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />      pretty<br />          sure, how he was<br />            reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />          somewhere &#40;may be in<br />            this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated<br />      during<br />          the times of Nayak<br />            kings much against the wishes of the<br />      Dikshitars of<br />          Chitrakoodam.<br />           <br />            Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />          neither acting as<br />            Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />      priest<br />          of the Temple of<br />            Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />          mention in the<br />            history.<br />           <br />            Regards,<br />            Venkatesh<br />           <br />            --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />          ,<br />      <br />    === message truncated ===<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />          <br />  <br />_____________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>_______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />    know-it-all with Yahoo!

			<div class="content">SPS Sir,<br /><br />The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai Vilaakam nor <br />Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh. This is were Rama,Sita <br />and Lakshmana stayed for atleast 11 years before Sita was abducted by <br />Ravana.

The<br />        thenkalais claim that<br />          vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />        after Ramanuja, but<br />          only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />        the Guruparampara.<br />          The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />        from Pillai<br />          Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br />         <br />          This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />        to accept the<br />          other&#39;s views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />        if one enters into a<br />          philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />        small writeup<br />          regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />        personal mails on that<br />          debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />        here. Ofcourse, it is<br />          subject to a debate.<br />         <br />          Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />        for 120 years. He<br />          attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />        are the timelines<br />          which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />         <br />          Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />        link to the<br />          Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />        happened later, though<br />          within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />        saying that<br />          Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />        from the sea and got<br />          it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />        sure, how he was<br />          reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />        somewhere &#40;may be in<br />          this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated during<br />        the times of Nayak<br />          kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />        Chitrakoodam.<br />         <br />          Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />        neither acting as<br />          Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />        of the Temple of<br />          Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />        mention in the<br />          history.<br />         <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh<br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />        ,<br />          "R.venketesh" <br />          wrote: <br />           <br />            Hi<br />            so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />           <br />            i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41;<br />        instruments used on ramanuja<br />            himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />        discovered in a<br />            secret chamber in the last decade<br />           <br />            .

			<div class="content">Smt Malathi,<br />Agreed, there cannot be another God.

If members are willing, I can share it<br />        here. Ofcourse, it is<br />          subject to a debate.<br />         <br />          Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />    lived<br />        for 120 years. He<br />          attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />    These<br />        are the timelines<br />          which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />         <br />          Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />    no<br />        link to the<br />          Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />        happened later, though<br />          within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />    right in<br />        saying that<br />          Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />        from the sea and got<br />          it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />    pretty<br />        sure, how he was<br />          reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />        somewhere &#40;may be in<br />          this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated<br />    during<br />        the times of Nayak<br />          kings much against the wishes of the<br />    Dikshitars of<br />        Chitrakoodam.<br />         <br />          Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />        neither acting as<br />          Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />    priest<br />        of the Temple of<br />          Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />        mention in the<br />          history.<br />         <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh<br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />        ,<br />    <br />  === message truncated ===<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />        <br />______________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />  know-it-all with Yahoo!

And you are<br />      right in<br />          saying that<br />            Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />          from the sea and got<br />            it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />      pretty<br />          sure, how he was<br />            reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />          somewhere &#40;may be in<br />            this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated<br />      during<br />          the times of Nayak<br />            kings much against the wishes of the<br />      Dikshitars of<br />          Chitrakoodam.<br />           <br />            Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />          neither acting as<br />            Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />      priest<br />          of the Temple of<br />            Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />          mention in the<br />            history.<br />           <br />            Regards,<br />            Venkatesh<br />           <br />            --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />          ,<br />      <br />    === message truncated ===<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />          <br />  <br />______________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />    know-it-all with Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Mr Vijay<br /><br />You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu getting ostracised <br />by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or ThiruvIzhimizhalai legend and vice <br />versa are, in my humble opinion, at best fictitious. I, for one, do <br />not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which associates an <br />ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as recently as 150 years <br />ago. <br /><br />I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and they were showing about <br />the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is very well know that it <br />was built during the times of Kulothunga I and he built it during <br />his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But immediately the presenter <br />started associating some PuraNa which did mention about a PerumAL <br />being present there. How!!!??? How in the world is this possible. <br /><br />Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny. It is said that Siva <br />took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu. First of all what is <br />the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of Narasimha to protect his <br />own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His mission. What was the <br />need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe some motive and accept <br />it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the legend of Pratyangira <br />becoming famous and more with the visits of ex-CM JJ to the temple in <br />Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is that, Parvathi or <br />Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />the husband has killed a person earlier, why would the wife need to <br />take another form to kill the same person and again what is the <br />motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? <br /><br />It is just that our ancestors who framed all these stories wanted to <br />ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by way of a SthalapurANam <br />so that the temple can be glorified. Really funny marketing tactics.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />PS: Just for the records, the number of Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />temples that associate Siva with it are too less compared to that of <br />the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with worshipping Siva at <br />those temples. Do we get some insight into this??<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vinjamoor_venkatesh" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Mr Rahul,<br />    <br />    This is indeed my first post in this group.
