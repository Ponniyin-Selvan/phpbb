			<div class="content">hi sir<br /><br />thanks - some questions again<br /><br />1) who is the crown prince - first born male son of the king or son <br />of the pattmahishi.<br /><br />2) we see that this was not strictly followed for cholas, but how <br />about others.<br /><br />3) is it mandatory that the king should take a pattamahishi to be <br />crowned ( as kalki writes in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> - when mamalla is being convinced by <br />mahendrar)<br /><br />4) any tent dates for crowning of vimaladityan and if so was kundavi <br />his pattamahishi.<br /><br />5) was raja raja narendra the crown prince.<br /><br />6) who was vijayaditha's mother and from which clan. ( i think in <br />mannan magal she is shown as the daugther of jayasimhan!!!)<br /><br />7) if raja raja narendra rules from 1018 onwards, then ammanga devi <br />could not be his pattamahishi - as the ganges campaign was only in <br />1019 - return to <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram">GKC</acronym> 1022 and tent marriage during that period.<br /><br />rgds<br />vj<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay,<br />  <br />  Kulothunga I&#39;s father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern Chalukya.<br />  Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />  Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was <br />Kundavi <br />  D/o <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> - I.<br />  <br />  Therefore Kulothunga I &#40;also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth <br />Star <br />  POOSAM&#41; is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter.
