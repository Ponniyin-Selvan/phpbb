			<div class="content">SUJATHA-ANOTHER KALKI<br />&nbsp;<br />I know Sujatha through my Srirangam sources. â€˜Ambiâ€™ (alias Sriman Venkataraman) a famous quote ofSujatha, in his Srirangam articles, a childhood friend of Sujatha, is father of my friend Priya, eminent Bharatanatya Dancer from Srirangam Natyalaya. Though I have met Mr. Rangarajan twice at BEL, Bangalore on some other official assignments, this contact of Ambi, I did not disclose to him. (Laterwhen I met him at Mylapore, I did tell him about this too). <br />&nbsp;<br />When Vamsadhara was published, as per the request of Ambi, (Ambi told me that if he recommended Sujatha to read my book, he will never read and Sujatha will not oblige too for such requests) I have sent the book for his perusal and I had requested him to commend few words and write in popular commercial magazine. The next week itself, Sujatha wrote in AV edition (21-03-2003) with whole lot of words of praise, and even suggested me to go for Telugu translation, as the story was fully dealing with Telugu land. After this incident, I had met him twice in different occasion before my second book, Thirumalai Thirudan was released. And I told him that I would put his comment on Vamsadhara in the back cover of TT for which, he smiled away.<br />&nbsp;<br />But I was not alone in the crowd. Sujatha gave such pat to every writer whoever he comes across. Countless poets and writers got his highly encourage comments.&nbsp; I used to ask some in-depth meaning on Azhwar prabhandams through mails for which he responds positively. He used to impress with his crisp writings and deep knowledge on the verses. &nbsp;His knowledge on Thiruvaimozhi and Mudhalaazhwars, somewhat incomparable. Apart from Bhakthi and deeper meanings, he enjoyed the Tamil words<br />&nbsp;<br />For Thirumalai Thirudan, just I have sent the book and after a month I have called him to ask about the book. This time I did not request him to write, but he himself opened the topic, appreciating the work and my free will to enter into a controversial subject. (I know that time he did receive some adverse comments from some Vaishnavite quarters for his writings in some magazine).<br />&nbsp;<br />To my surprise, he said that he has seen also the good&nbsp;comments of Dr.Oppiliappan Koil Sadagopan, on my book, in the Srivaishnavite e-magazine. Sujatha commented people like him cannot write such controversial subjects, as it will create furors all over, andeven advised me to tap such details for my future works. I took it as great compliments from a great scholar.<br />&nbsp;<br />Who can forget his Ganesh and Vasanths? His â€˜genoâ€™, or his â€˜karaiyellaam shenbagappuâ€™.Saavi rightly said that he would publish whatever Sujatha gives, including his handwriting bill of dirty cloths given to Washer man. His sense of comedy and satiric comment, novelty and revolution, all his wealth of letters. Even in writing â€˜adults only jokesâ€™ too he established his stamp. One particular joke on donkey, the end part, I think, he has not revealed at all. From electronics and science to social and historic novels, from dramas to dancefestival reviews, every thing he has written. Apart from writing, he was very great reader too. After Kalki, in the Tamil world, the great Sujatha only did write on all sorts of subjects.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sujatha was already a very famous faceamong the readerâ€™s crowd, but cinemaâ€™s like Anniyan, Boys and Sivaji took him somewhere to very great heights. To add with, the friendship of Kamal for long long time and his close touch with tinsel world forthe past thirty years (I think, Priya was first movie, or may be another one in which Jaishankar acted in the roll of Ganesh, or Sridevi acted in Black and white movie â€“ I forgot), made him really unreachable to ordinary people like me. Yet, the simplicity of Sujatha and grace of God, allowed me too to reach him in the right time.<br />&nbsp;<br />KALKIYIN INNORU SAKAAPTHAM MUDIVUKKU VANTHULLATHU.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dhivakar<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;--- On Thu,28/2/08, R.venketesh &lt;abhivencat@...&gt; wrote:<br />From: R.venketesh &lt;abhivencat@...&gt;Subject: [ponniyinselvan] sujatha- infoTo:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comDate">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comDate</a><!-- e -->: Thursday, 28 February, 2008, 10:36 AM<br /><br /><br />Hiits a matter of pride that venkat ram diwaker has had a personal touch with sujatha.I am sure he wouldnt take much time before writing about his experiences.but before that i wish members could contributeinformation and trivia on sujatha.rangarajan was from srirangam ( he immortalised the town in his srirangaththu thevathaikal. )another rangarajan from srirangam is poet vaali.rangarajan was a classmate of apj abdul kalamrangarajan, was an employee of public sector companies. he headed the team which invented the automatic voting machine.received an award from Govt of India's National Council for Science and Technology in 1993 for making Science accessible to the public through his bookshad his way of getting into contreversies. one was a in a novel in the 80's when his books were burnt by one communityrecently his dialougue for the movie 'boys' also got him<br />some ill fame.venketesh<br /><br /><br /> Get the freedom to save as many mails as you wish.

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by singanallur ramaswamy  using id singanallur ramaswamy </span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br /><br />Hi,<br /> <br />In the death of Sujatha we have lost a very fine multi-faceted writer who had enthralled the readers since the 1960s. If I am not wrong he started with a bang with his first novel itself in Kumduam, 'Nylon Kayiru', a murder mystery which is totally different from those written in that genre in thosedays. There was no Ganesh and Vasant (they came in later) and the entire novel revolves around a diary written by the murdered girl. Significantly it's set in Bombay, a city which he did not bring into his later novels to a large extent. <br /> <br />Like Kalki before him Sujatha also developed a unique style and he was helped by the magazine Kumudam. He once wrote Iranginan as if it was a straircase and the mag accepted it. He also used words such "Taktakkinaan" instead of "tak tak endru kadavai idithan", somewhat akin to limited overs cricket. <br /> <br />Though he wrote quite a no of novels, including historicals, I feel he was outstanding in his short stories written in the 1970s. One of his most memorable short stories was about the state of our municipal hospitals and the callous way the poor are treated there finally leaving the mother of a sickyoung girl to take her back to her village to be treated by traditional medicine. <br /> <br />Some of his dramas are also memorable and I particularly will mention "Kadavul Vandhirundhar". He was indeed the pioneer of sci-fi in Tamil, like Kalki was for historical romances.<br /> <br /><br /><br />To:  ponniyinselvan@...: venkdhivakar@...: Thu, 28 Feb 2008 15:49:42 +0530Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] sujatha- info<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SUJATHA-ANOTHER KALKI<br /> <br />I know Sujatha through my Srirangam sources. â€˜Ambiâ€™ (alias Sriman Venkataraman) a famous quote of Sujatha, in his Srirangam articles, a childhood friend of Sujatha, is father of my friend Priya, eminent Bharatanatya Dancer from Srirangam Natyalaya.

I used to ask some in-depth meaning on Azhwar prabhandams through mails for which he responds positively. He used to impress with his crispwritings and deep knowledge on the verses. His knowledge on Thiruvaimozhiand Mudhalaazhwars, somewhat incomparable. Apart from Bhakthi and deeper meanings, he enjoyed the Tamil words<br /> <br />For Thirumalai Thirudan, just I have sent the book and after a month I havecalled him to ask about the book. This time I did not request him to write, but he himself opened the topic, appreciating the work and my free will to enter into a controversial subject. (I know that time he did receive someadverse comments from some Vaishnavite quarters for his writings in some magazine).<br /> <br />To my surprise, he said that he has seen also the good comments of Dr.Oppiliappan Koil Sadagopan, on my book, in the Srivaishnavite e-magazine. Sujatha commented people like him cannot write such controversial subjects, as itwill create furors all over, and even advised me to tap such details for my future works. I took it as great compliments from a great scholar.<br /> <br />Who can forget his Ganesh and Vasanths? His â€˜genoâ€™, or his â€˜karaiyellaam shenbagappuâ€™.Saavi rightly said that he would publish whatever Sujatha gives, including his handwriting bill of dirty cloths given to Washer man. His sense of comedy and satiric comment, novelty and revolution, all his wealth of letters. Even in writing â€˜adults only jokesâ€™ too he established his stamp. One particular joke on donkey, the end part, I think, he has not revealed at all. From electronics and science to social and historic novels, from dramas to dance festival reviews, every thing he has written. Apart from writing, he was very great reader too. After Kalki, in the Tamil world, the great Sujatha only did write on all sorts of subjects.<br /> <br />Sujatha was already a very famous face among the readerâ€™s crowd, but cinemaâ€™s like Anniyan, Boys and Sivaji took him somewhere to very great heights. To add with, the friendship of Kamal for long long time and his close touch with tinsel world for the past thirty years (I think, Priya was first movie, or may be another one in which Jaishankar acted in the roll of Ganesh, or Sridevi acted in Black and white movie â€“ I forgot), made him reallyunreachable to ordinary people like me. Yet, the simplicity of Sujatha andgrace of God, allowed me too to reach him in the right time.<br /> <br />KALKIYIN INNORU SAKAAPTHAM MUDIVUKKU VANTHULLATHU.<br /> <br />Dhivakar<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />--- On Thu, 28/2/08, R.venketesh  wrote: <br />From: R.venketesh Subject: [ponniyinselvan] sujatha- infoTo:  ponniyinselvan@...: Thursday, 28 February, 2008, 10:36 AM<br /><br /><br />Hiits a matter of pride that venkat ram diwaker has had a personal touch with sujatha.I am sure he wouldnt take much time before writing about his experiences.but before that i wish members could contribute information and trivia on sujatha.rangarajan was from srirangam ( he immortalised the town inhis srirangaththu thevathaikal. )another rangarajan from srirangam is poetvaali.rangarajan was a classmate of apj abdul kalamrangarajan, was an employee of public sector companies. he headed the team which invented the automatic voting machine.received an award from Govt of India's National Council for Science and Technology in 1993 for making Science accessible to the public through his bookshad his way of getting into contreversies. one was ain a novel in the 80's when his books were burnt by one communityrecently his dialougue for the movie 'boys' also got him some ill fame.venketesh<br /><br />Get the freedom to save as many mails as you wish.
