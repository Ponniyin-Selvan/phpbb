			<div class="content">Dear Sundar<br />Thank you for drawing our attention to this article It did highlight a few things I believe<br /><br /><br /><br />In Person<br /><br />Monday, March 14, 2005<br />-- <br />?Everyone has the right to be ignorant?<br /><br />Sri Sri Ravi Shankar offers a counterpoint to Javed Akhtar?s finite views on spirituality<br /><br />It is funny that in a country like India spirituality is talked about as a hoax. How can something which is so obvious, which is part of millions of people, be taken as a hoax? Spirituality is not a halo of the few, it is the breath of every human being. Have people forgotten that freedom was achieved through spirituality as the prime means by Mahatma Gandhi?<br />But there are people who question the integrity of MKG<br />Spirituality is intoxicating. Only those who step into it will know. Before criticising we need to do our homework. Has one visited ashrams, like the Ramakrishna Ashram, Ananda Mayi Ma Mutt, Brahma Kumaris?, Gayatri Parivar, Pandurang Shastri, Sri Aurobindo Ashram or Art of Living? Has one spent time with saints? Only then does one?s views carry weight, else they remain simple accusations only, a distorted perception, not reality.<br />Thats very true<br />Blaming the entire modern-day spiritual guru and sadhu community is as foolish as branding the entire Muslim community as terrorists.<br />Thats my point<br />It is the medieval brahmanical mindset to always put down business and politics and the colonial mindset to denounce gurus. As a result we never expanded our political influence nor globalised our business until very recently.<br />Spirituality is not a matter of the head, it is a matter of the heart. I had two choices: to argue and turn the conclave into a conflict or to keep silence. I chose the latter.<br /><br /><br /><br />regards<br /><br />Sri<br /><br />Send instant messages to your online <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com">friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content">Facts check on this post:<br /><br />"During Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo's worked. But the first to<br />reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total<br />effort." - As someone who lives in excel spreadsheets and runs stat<br />models everyday, I am a little too picky about numbers. 20%? Which<br />means that you have somehow managed to measure the amount of relief<br />that poured in after the tsunami. Something which the UN still hasn't<br />managed to do! Interesting! Can you give us hard numbers - number of<br />people, organizations, places, all verifiable? Please note: I am not<br />questioning that RSS or any other org did relief work. I am sure they<br />did and I'd the first to give them credit for that. The same credit<br />I'd give DYFI workers who did the same work. I only have issues with<br />throwing hard numbers around without any evidence whatsoever!<br /><br />"Why didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?" - Same logic<br />as 'Slavery never existed as Christainity is still around. There have<br />been stray instances of slavery ofcourse but the Bible never<br />supported it . Its all misrepresentation'. Revolutions are not all<br />swift and bloody.<br /><br />"I appreciate the western countries and the missionaries a lot. They<br />are great strategists. They are not aiming and immediate conversion.<br />They have a 100 or 1000 year plan, which started 300 years back." -<br />No evidence, no supporting facts. Note again: I know very well how<br />missionaries operate and I am not questioning whether they use<br />underhand tactics(we all know they do). I only have issues with this<br />100/1000 year plans and such conspiracy theories.<br /><br />"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org.<br />reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena, why<br />you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about the<br />hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or rather<br />anti-BJP talks." - Not entirely sure what is Marxist talk! When<br />someone says the answer to violence is not more violence, it does not<br />mean that person is condoning violence on one side.<br /><br />Veena<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Over nightla evvalavu mailaaa.......good debate. Welcome back<br />priya,<br />  again with your punch.<br /> <br />  All, I think no one read my mail and understood what I meant, esp.<br />  Veena. If my words gave a different meaning I plead apology. But I<br />  request you to go through it again. I never supported or said<br />RSS/VHP<br />  thier voilence are correct. I only said, dont just take one<br />incident<br />  of babri masjid, see alse the service they render to the society. I<br />  think this point is lost in the ether.<br /> <br />  Veena, during Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo&#39;s worked. But the first<br />  to reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total<br />  effort. thats what I stressed. When you criticise them, you should<br />  also appreciate them for their good, if at all you are really<br />  neutral.But all the media highlighted all NGOs but not RSS. Is this<br />  democracy? Is this secularism? Thats what I tried to pointed out,<br />but<br />  you see only in your view, stamping them to be extremists.<br /> <br />  I think Samptha, Priya, and others have given valuable points,which<br />I<br />  need not ponder again. I wrote this earlier, but since veena<br />pointed<br />  out the burining of people on the streets of gujarat, I say this.<br />  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org.<br />  reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena,<br />why<br />  you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about<br />the<br />  hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or<br />rather<br />  anti-BJP talks. Its Gujrat communal clash, not a genocide. Communal<br />  clash means both communities suffer. If muslims weer burnt on the<br />  street, hindus should also would have burned on the streets. Its<br />only<br />  that the mediat didnt publish it and published anti-hindu news<br />alone.<br />  You are learned, try to think logically. If 2000 people die in a<br />  communal class, 50% on each side means 1000 hindus also died.<br />simple<br />  arithmatic, right? Btw, I am not supporting what the Hindus did,<br />nor<br />  support violence. I am just questioning, why you people talk only<br />  anti-hindu and are not neutral, why you dont condemn godhra<br />  carnage,but only condemn hindu acts alone...you need not answer me<br />  nor I expect an answer. Please try to answer yourSELF.<br /> <br />  Veena, actually I wrote the words like, you have all the<br />  qualifications to become a politician, and then thought it might<br />hurt<br />  you and erased it. But I fell laughing when you said I have all the<br />  qualification to be a RSS person. Thanks for the compliment and in<br />  your words, I feel proud to get such a complement.If you have read<br />my<br />  last words of the mail, I clearly stated that the Hindu org never<br />  asked others to quit, but only pleading for the peaceful<br />  cooexistence. When its denied, as sampath stated, they emotionally<br />  turn to violence.<br /> <br />  Dear Sri, your points are valid. I have never read the manusmrithi<br />  and so cant comment on it. But my feeling is if such bad things are<br />  there in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism would have swept away<br />  Hinduism. You yourself said, inspite of all invasion,culture or<br />  imperial, Hinduism survived. If many bad things were there, how<br />come<br />  it survived. I feel its the misinterpretation of facts. Probably I<br />am<br />  wrong, but I live it to you to think. If Hinduism is so bad, how<br />come<br />  its surviving from time immemorial. Suppression will alwasy lead to<br />  revolution. Frech Revolution, Boston Tea party, breaking of the<br />USSR<br />  etc. etc. We dont have any such instances in our country. If people<br />  were suppressed in the name of caste&#40;I do accept there might be<br />stray<br />  instances but we should not brand with stray instances&#41;surely they<br />  should have revolted long back.Just give a thought.I am trying to<br />  thing logically. If you compress a baloon it will surely burst. Why<br />  didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?<br /> <br />  Supreme court has given judgement sometime back that only<br />minorities<br />  can open institutions.Whats wrong in admitting only FC in an<br />  institution, if all other religion and other castes have their own<br />  institution. I am hearing this for the first time. Where will the<br />  FC&#39;s go if they cant get admission in the name of reservation? Why<br />  dont you point out that minority institutions admit only<br />minorities.<br />  Dont say they also admit Hindus, it will happen only if you have<br />high<br />  recomendation. I studied in Loyola college chennai and I know their<br />  admission procedure. If you had said that all institutions should<br />  admit based on merit or the govt. prescribed reservation policy I<br />  would have been happy. But pointing out one institution which<br />admits<br />  FCs, when the country is flooded with 1000s of minority<br />institutions<br />  and jathi based instititutions admitting their clan, your point<br />  looses its base.<br /> <br />  Re. Christian institutions converting. I appreciate the western<br />  countries and the missionaries a lot. They are great strategists.<br />  They are not aiming and immediate conversion. They have a 100 or<br />1000<br />  year plan, which started 300 years back. They started by slowing<br />  getting involved in social activities, setting up schools, colleges<br />  etc.by which they can infiltrate the society. Today celebrating<br />  birthdays by cutting cakes &#40;I think we Hindus only go by<br />natchatiram<br />  and not by date..&#41;, celebrating christmas, new year, valentines<br />  day,mothers day, fathers day, etc etc. the influence of christian<br />  life style. Though we had all these in our culture itself, we<br />adopted<br />  western culture. Without our knowledge we lost our culture. Once<br />  culture is lost, its easy to break the religion. Well planned, well<br />  executed converson strategy, which is still going on. But on the<br />  outset we cant find it out. I am sure you will criticize me for<br />this<br />  saying I am going nuts thinking crazy, but I seriously think in<br />this<br />  angle, which is agreat threat to our society. So we cant blindly<br />  say, christians run schools just for the societies cause.It has its<br />  own internal agenda. Why should a school have a church inside?<br />every<br />  christian school will have a church and you should be knowing it.<br />If<br />  only education is their motto why church inside the premisis?<br /> <br />  I am wondering, if in such a small group itself, talking in favour<br />of<br />  Hindus is fanatism what about at the country level...my god..<br /> <br />  Such debates can never end, and no one cn change others opinions.<br />But<br />  being humans we should be able to correct oursleves, by<br />retrospecting<br />  and knowing what is right and what is wrong. Let it be you or<br />me...we<br />  should not just go by the band wagon effect.If my views are wrong I<br />  am alwasy ready to change.......<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote></div>

But if at all the scriptures<br />define<br />  treatment to different varnas&#40;I dont accept the caste based system,<br />  it was only varna dharma&#41;, the same scriptures also say that what<br />  deed of each varna will lead them to moksha..<br /> <br />  A brahmin has to get up early, do his daily routines like<br />  sandhyavandhanam, do pooja, do yagnja, chant vedas the whole day<br />and<br />  should always be doing all these for the welfare of the society.<br />Its<br />  scientifically proven what impact the environment has when vedas<br />are<br />  chanted and yagams are done. They should not posses any wealth,<br />apart<br />  from their next time meal. These rituals will take the whole day<br />and<br />  brahmins has to do all this throughout their life to attain moksha.<br />  It goes in the descending order and for sudhras its more than<br />enough<br />  if they utter the lords name once, just once a day , to attain<br />  moksha. Why my dear friend Sri is not looking at this point?<br /> <br />  Re. Misinterpreation of vedas et all..I read on article written by<br />  some vested interest in Islam. It goes like this. We Hindus pray<br />lord<br />  shiva in the form of &#39;Lingam&#39;. We all dont realise the basics<br />behind<br />  our religion and thats our weakness. Lingam is called Aroopa<br />Roopam ,<br />  the formless form. People like Benny hin will call Hindus as<br />  prostitutes because we do Idol worship and the so called seculars<br />  will clap happily for this. Hinduism says the higest form of god,<br />the<br />  Brahmam does not have any form and Lingam symbolises it. Then why<br />  such a semi circular &#40;to some extent&#41; form is given to LIngam?<br />  Anywhere in this universe, if we stand in any place and look above<br />  us, the area which our eyes can see is only a hemisphere above us<br />and<br />  if you can visualise, thats nothing but the form of Lingam and<br />thats<br />  why shiva is given that formless form.<br /> <br />  COming to the article &#40;misinterpreation&#41; I read. It seems Lingam<br />has<br />  another meaning in Sanskrit. It denotes the male sexual organ. The<br />  article claims that Hindus are perverted and enjoy sexuality and<br />  thats why we have given the form of the male sexual organ to our<br />god<br />  Shiva. And we happily name our children as Ramalingam&#40;Rama&#39;s ----&#41;<br />  Sundaralingam &#40;Beautiful ---&#41;.. etc. Any sane person who knows<br />about<br />  Hinduism will laugh at this. Does this make any sense? Probably for<br />  the poeople who go by the western/communist/Dravidian ideologies<br />will<br />  accept this and say Hinduism is all bullshit..<br /> <br />  Dr.Sri, whatever you quote about manusmrithi or the discrimination<br />  among the people refered in the scriptures etc. only reminded me of<br />  the above said artilce. I dont want to write this, but I needed an<br />  example to clear some of the misinterpreation you have. Any person<br />  who is against hinduism could have written the bashyam for the<br />  scripts which you could have read. That doesnt make the end of it.<br />  Thats what I repeatedly say, we have brains to think and we should<br />  think logically. Stray incidents do not make what Hinduism actually<br />  is. Please Please Please try to understand this.<br /> <br />  I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet<br />policy<br />  prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the<br />  news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling&#40;probably<br />  adhamgam towards our religion&#41; you have towards Hinduism is by<br />  reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how far<br />  media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in<br />  Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu, misquoted<br />  Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass who<br />  read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go<br />and<br />  tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have<br />witnessed<br />  it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for an<br />  article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe<br />  article was published, whatever I said was published as told by my<br />  classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if I<br />  told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media<br />plays<br />  with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them<br />to<br />  be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case, the<br />  entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but<br />whenthe<br />  Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and<br />when<br />  the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up<br />with<br />  a case where there is not even a single evidence against the<br />acharya<br />  in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the mindset<br />  of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely<br />think<br />  wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should<br />  remember that our countries media is in the hands of the communist<br />  and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will<br />  publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing example<br />  how our religion is targeted by the christians&#40;its said that<br />foreing<br />  missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because Jeyendrar<br />  is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop conversion.&#41;<br /> <br />  As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely<br />is<br />  good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through<br />  coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass and<br />  look at the facts<br /> <br />  The entire mail is not intended for a single person called Sri, but<br />  to the entire group and if possible to the entire world. -:&#41;<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Satsih</div></blockquote></div>

Translations for vedas<br />were<br />    first written by the westerners. Sanskirt like other language,<br />has<br />    words which gives many meanings for the same words. Every sloka<br />can<br />    be interpreted in several ways. Westerners took only the wrong<br />    meaning and spread it to the uneducated mass only to convert them<br />  and<br />    still we people are following those bashyams as the original<br />  bashyam<br />    for vedas.<br />   <br />    Sampath has thrown much light on this. Cho is writing an article<br />in<br />    Tuqlaq titled "Hindu Maha Samudram" which is a must read for all,<br />  in<br />    which he ponders all these topics. Before three hundered years,<br />    people were happy and peaceful without much discrimination. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>&#39;s<br />    Talicheri kalvettu is a standing proof for this. The Tanjai<br />  pictures<br />    clearly show that even queens did not wear upper garments in<br />those<br />    days. We have historic proof for all the equalities we had in the<br />  past<br />    &#40;again talicheri kalvettu is the standing example where a King<br />    respects even the kadai nilai oozhiyan&#41;. But only after the<br />  europeans<br />    entered India all the confusion started. And we got corrupted in<br />  our<br />    minds and blindly follow what they told to confuse us. This<br />  weakness<br />    is what they are using for conversion, and thats what I am<br />  repeatedly<br />    trying to stress.But ....<br />   <br />    The open letter was funny enough to read. Sampath has torn it<br />  apart.<br />    Any christian or muslim can very well have written that letter in<br />    disguise to tarnish Hindus image? can you prove me wrong??...<br />   <br />    Sri talks about all the wrong things Manusmrithi talks<br />about..Again<br />  I<br />    say i have not read manusmrithi. But if at all the scriptures<br />  define<br />    treatment to different varnas&#40;I dont accept the caste based<br />system,<br />    it was only varna dharma&#41;, the same scriptures also say that what<br />    deed of each varna will lead them to moksha..<br />   <br />    A brahmin has to get up early, do his daily routines like<br />    sandhyavandhanam, do pooja, do yagnja, chant vedas the whole day<br />  and<br />    should always be doing all these for the welfare of the society.<br />  Its<br />    scientifically proven what impact the environment has when vedas<br />  are<br />    chanted and yagams are done. They should not posses any wealth,<br />  apart<br />    from their next time meal. These rituals will take the whole day<br />  and<br />    brahmins has to do all this throughout their life to attain<br />moksha.<br />    It goes in the descending order and for sudhras its more than<br />  enough<br />    if they utter the lords name once, just once a day , to attain<br />    moksha. Why my dear friend Sri is not looking at this point?<br />   <br />    Re. Misinterpreation of vedas et all..I read on article written<br />by<br />    some vested interest in Islam. It goes like this. We Hindus pray<br />  lord<br />    shiva in the form of &#39;Lingam&#39;. We all dont realise the basics<br />  behind<br />    our religion and thats our weakness. Lingam is called Aroopa<br />  Roopam ,<br />    the formless form. People like Benny hin will call Hindus as<br />    prostitutes because we do Idol worship and the so called seculars<br />    will clap happily for this. Hinduism says the higest form of god,<br />  the<br />    Brahmam does not have any form and Lingam symbolises it. Then why<br />    such a semi circular &#40;to some extent&#41; form is given to LIngam?<br />    Anywhere in this universe, if we stand in any place and look<br />above<br />    us, the area which our eyes can see is only a hemisphere above us<br />  and<br />    if you can visualise, thats nothing but the form of Lingam and<br />  thats<br />    why shiva is given that formless form.<br />   <br />    COming to the article &#40;misinterpreation&#41; I read. It seems Lingam<br />  has<br />    another meaning in Sanskrit. It denotes the male sexual organ.<br />The<br />    article claims that Hindus are perverted and enjoy sexuality and<br />    thats why we have given the form of the male sexual organ to our<br />  god<br />    Shiva. And we happily name our children as Ramalingam&#40;Rama&#39;s ----<br />&#41;<br />    Sundaralingam &#40;Beautiful ---&#41;.. etc. Any sane person who knows<br />  about<br />    Hinduism will laugh at this. Does this make any sense? Probably<br />for<br />    the poeople who go by the western/communist/Dravidian ideologies<br />  will<br />    accept this and say Hinduism is all bullshit..<br />   <br />    Dr.Sri, whatever you quote about manusmrithi or the<br />discrimination<br />    among the people refered in the scriptures etc. only reminded me<br />of<br />    the above said artilce. I dont want to write this, but I needed<br />an<br />    example to clear some of the misinterpreation you have. Any<br />person<br />    who is against hinduism could have written the bashyam for the<br />    scripts which you could have read. That doesnt make the end of<br />it.<br />    Thats what I repeatedly say, we have brains to think and we<br />should<br />    think logically. Stray incidents do not make what Hinduism<br />actually<br />    is. Please Please Please try to understand this.<br />   <br />    I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet<br />  policy<br />    prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the<br />    news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling&#40;probably<br />    adhamgam towards our religion&#41; you have towards Hinduism is by<br />    reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how<br />far<br />    media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in<br />    Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu,<br />misquoted<br />    Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass<br />who<br />    read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go<br />  and<br />    tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have<br />  witnessed<br />    it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for<br />an<br />    article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe<br />    article was published, whatever I said was published as told by<br />my<br />    classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if<br />I<br />    told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media<br />  plays<br />    with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them<br />  to<br />    be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case,<br />the<br />    entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but<br />  whenthe<br />    Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and<br />  when<br />    the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up<br />  with<br />    a case where there is not even a single evidence against the<br />  acharya<br />    in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the<br />mindset<br />    of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely<br />  think<br />    wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should<br />    remember that our countries media is in the hands of the<br />communist<br />    and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will<br />    publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing<br />example<br />    how our religion is targeted by the christians&#40;its said that<br />  foreing<br />    missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because<br />Jeyendrar<br />    is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop<br />conversion.&#41;<br />   <br />    As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely<br />  is<br />    good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through<br />    coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass<br />and<br />    look at the facts<br />   <br />    The entire mail is not intended for a single person called Sri,<br />but<br />    to the entire group and if possible to the entire world. -:&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Satsih<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Yahoo!

But his followers did not give up. They started<br />spreading his message. Today he is the man behind one of the largest<br />religions in the history of mankind(though it has a violent history<br />like most other religions). Even you call him a great soul. Might<br />not have happened if he had slapped the guy back 2000 years ago.<br /><br />A:Becoming a great soul is easy.If I throw away my studies and<br />family life and go to uganda to serve the poor I too will be called<br />as a great soul.If I die in that process,the more cruel my death<br />is,the more popular I will be.So why there are not many great souls?<br /><br />(I will tell you a secret.Great soul=thiyagi=bali adu=punnagai<br />mannan)All will praise such great souls but nobody will want to<br />become a great soul.<br /><br />Imagine a comical situation.Mother theresa did everything for<br />jesus.She sacrificed her marriage,life everything for jesus.She is a<br />great soul.She goes before god with a beaming heart.But to her<br />horror she finds out that God is Allah and not jesus.What will be<br />her situation?<br /><br />She wasted her life,thats it.What use was her great soul title ?<br />zilch.<br /><br />Q:It might not work all the time but its better than revenge. After<br />all, whats the difference between the killer and the avenger if<br />they both do the same thing?<br /><br />A:Killer lives happily,the great soul dies happily.Thats the<br />difference.<br /><br /><br />.</div>
