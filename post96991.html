			<div class="content">tells us how pazhuvur and kodumbalur were the pillars of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.-----<br />-----------------------------------------<br />< Yes. Even during Koppam war against Chalukyas during Rajathi Raja's time, (Rajendra' son) when the King was killed in the war, the sambuvaraiyars and Malaiyamans played a very great role in in-stalling an Emperor (Rajendra-2) in the war-field itself . The Chieftians stick to the policy of central Rule even during crisis. It was due to Rajaraja's policy only.<br /><br />I remember Kargil war and Indo-pak/bangla war. All states of India with different CMs united as one against a common enemy. This was seen during Chola period.<br /><br />But it was not there during later cholas. Again example - Kopperunginken. When a local chieftian like him capture a chola emperor and his court, an outsider (those days) like hoysala has to come and rescue. What has happened to other local chieftians?<br /><br />Anbudan<br />Dhivakar<br /><br /><br />"R.venketesh"  wrote:<br />And in-fighting started between main chieftians - example<br />Kopperunginkan who built THILLAI Gopurams.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>this charecter seems to be a fascinating one,</div></blockquote><br />he was pious built the south gopuram of chidambaram.<br /><br />was a feudatory of the chola king and at one point rebelled held the<br />entire chola court hostage and took titles for it. the hoysals had to<br />come and bail out the chola king.<br /><br />tells us how pazhuvur and kodumbalur were the pillars of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /><br />the same thing happend with later pandyas. no feudatories. the ever<br />hungry pandya war machine had gobbled up everybody and when malik<br />kafur came there was nobody to even slow him down.<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Find out what India is talking about on - Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Kopperunjia was infact supposed to be from the line of Pallavas and hence had ambitions of reviving the pallava dynasty..

			<div class="content">Dear Venkatesh<br /><br />In Periya Puranam Sekkizhar when mentioning about Appar Piran and His conversion into saivism, narrated how 'Kadava King' rushed to seek the pardon of Appar Piran. Kadava, the word may be started used from 6th century onwards for Pallavas. Ayyadigal Kadavarkon, a nayanmar related to Pallava Simhavarman (Mahendra's grandfather) was a King turned 'Sivanadiyaar' who sang 'Kshetra Thiruvenbaa' which was included in ThirumuRai. I have read these small sects of songs. Just beutiful and telling us about the glorious temples of Chola country.In later chola inscriptions the pallava sub-ordinates being called as Kadavarayas<br /><br />Azhakiya Siyan Kopperunjinkan, son of Azhakiya Pallava Sadumperumal, must be considered as very important among the major causes for the decline of the later Cholas. . He was a Kadava and the Kadavas of the 13th century were the descendants of the Pallavas. Kaduvetti was a variant of Kadava and stood for Pallava. We hear of Tondaimans and Kadavas from the beginning of Imperial Chola power indicating that the fall of Aparajita did not mean the extinction of the Pallava.<br /><br />With Kulottunga III who was no doubt a competent ruler, the decline in Chola fortunes marked by the rise of unruly subordinates becomes obvious. In the reign of Rajaraja III (Son of K-III) the Kadavas of Tondaimandalam under the leadership of Kopperunjinga assumed enough independence and power not only to question Imperial Chola authority but give battle to the Chola and even defeat and imprison him. From: the days of Kulottunga III, punishment of subordinate chief?s for treason had become common and frequent. The chief?s in their turn formed compacts by which they solemnly bound themselves to a code of behaviour which could be and usually was directed against the sovereign. Thus was inaugurated an age of treason and open defiance of imperial authority. There were numeroud inscriptions in the time of Raja Raja III speaks of treasons and punishment (Rajadhrokam).<br /><br />Of those who succeeded in this most, the ambitious Kopperunjinga was the most illustrious for his activities were not confined to rebellion and treason. In his own right he was a good ruler and a great patron of art. He started as a loyal feudatory of the Cholas. But in 1231 at Tellaru (near Wandiwash) he defeated the emperor Rajaraja III and imprisoned him at Sendamangalam. Vira Narasimha II Hoysala intervened on behalf of the Cholas, defeated Kopperunjinga and restored Rajaraja to the Chola throne. For a time Kopperunjinga became loyal to the Chola. But in 1243 he again assumed independent status. He avenged his defeat at the hands of the Hoysalas by defeating them at Perambur. Trichy district in 1252/53. The meteoric career of Kopperunjinga was however rudely reduced to vassalage by Jatavarman Sundara, the all ? conquering Pandya. Kopperunjinga?s activities were spread over the Tondaimandalam mainly. He built the eastern tower of Chidambaram temple. He assumed high<br />sounding titles like 'Kavisarvabhauma' (Kavichakravarthi) which means ? emperor among poets?. This could have been an exaggeration but his general abilities in government and warfare are beyond question. This very in subordinate is an excellent illustration of the kind of chieftains declining kingdoms will throw up. Not only incriptions, even one classical work 'Gadhyakarnamrutha' lights some of the acheivements of this king's numerous endowments and reconstruction of temple works which earned him a name in the cultural history of Tamil Nadu.<br />Ku. Balasubramaniam's Koyirkalai book says (referring various Historians) Kopperunjikan was invloved in the construction of three Rajagopuram of Thillai.<br /><br />SENDAMANGALAM: Kopperunjinkan must have erred here that he captured the last emperor of Chola Raja Raja III, when the king was escaping to Hoysala country after failing with Pandya. 'Gadyakarnamrutha' say that the King was overtaken surprisely by Kopperunjinkan and thrown into the prison at Sendamangalam. But Hoysala came to the rescue of Chola with the vengence and ransacked Sendamangalam and released Chola and he was restored to Chola throne too. For this, the army of Hoysala stayed back permenantly in the Chola country to keep peace for some time and subdued the irrespressable Kopperunjinkan too.<br /><br />But whatever Hostory talked about Kopperunjinkan and his treasonable activities for the fall of chola empire, Raja Raja III has also got a name in the history as an imcompetent Chola King.<br /><br />Anbudan<br />Dhivakar<br /><br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />Kopperunjia was infact supposed to be from the line of Pallavas and hence had ambitions of reviving the pallava dynasty.. I am not sure, if the Hoysalas overram him, I am not sure if it was someshwara who did that..

In <br />that sense VanthiyathevAn etc were Chola nationalists while even <br />Ravidasan and co were Pandya nationalists.<br /><br />Cheers, Arun<br /><br />On 11/6/06, Deepa Prakash deepaprakash@ wrote: <br />Must have been fun looking for a hill that looks like<br />a deer:)<br />I too get compeletely mesmerised by Kalki's works<br /><br /><br />--- Sivaram Kannan sivaram_sk@  <br />wrote: <br />Sir,<br />Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts with the<br />fiction. I remember one particular story well. It<br />is called poimaan karadu. It is about a illusion in<br />a hill that looks like a deer at some place near<br />Namakkal. When traveled through the same route i<br />could looking for similar kind of hill structure<br />along the road.<br /><br />You may not be able to find nationalism in his<br />historic writing may be, but his attachment to<br />Rajaji and Gandhi is well known and can be seen in<br />many of his non-fiction works.<br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />"R.venketesh" abhivencat@   wrote: <br />Hi Deepa<br /><br />you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not<br />familiar with the tamil script<br /><br />I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one<br />or two a week.<br />I am able to see a common thread but what fascinated me was his<br />obsession for life after death.<br />for a descriptive man like kalki such situations<br />are like halwa.he comes out in flying colours in such stories where<br />he uses last life memories.<br /><br />his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a<br />tale of a freedom fighter on the run after destroying a railway<br />track. he hides in a dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl <br />who father is a staunch british supporter.<br />he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the girl is there too in<br />the past life.<br />a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2<br />eras. pre congress and<br />post congress.<br />that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />nationalism.<br />but frankly speaking kalki always talks about<br />infighting with tamils or indians in his historic books. I dont <br />think there was much nationalism involved in his historic books <br />though they were deeply recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br /><br />what he talked about was the victory of one indian<br />clan over another. highly localised nationalism in fact. <br />glad if you could point some<br />instances of nationalism in his historic books.<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --> 40yahoogroups.com ,<br />Deepa Prakash</div>
