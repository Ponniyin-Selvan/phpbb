			<div class="content">1 thing could be a natural phenomenon, there is no singular dynasty <br />across the globe to span for a long period of time.<br />I am particularly interetested in the last good chola king Kulothunga <br />III. <br />He did rule for some time over a large territory. His lost war with <br />Sundara pandya and tiggered collapse of the chola front.<br /><br />I dont understand one thing, 1212 AD K-III plundered the pandya <br />kingdom and 1216 AD - Pandya is able to strike back till chidambaram <br />paralysing the chola reign. How did the Chola dominance fall so badly <br />in 3 years and how did pandyas pick up in 3 yrs.<br />Also read that pandyas and hosala kingdoms had muslim mercenaries <br />employed by them...were these people from the kingdom or sailed from <br />other countries?<br /><br />Interesting prespective to how the world acted then and now.<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br />  <br />  the cholas within a century and a half from their pinnacle were <br />  iretrievably on the decline.<br />  their enemies had strengthened, their teritories had shrunk.<br />  many reasons could be attributed. <br />  did the decline start with the govindaraja episode? not the curse <br />but <br />  had they alieanated a portion of their people?<br />  or because the cholas had become telugu and lost the loyalty of <br />the <br />  tamil population?<br />  how come? surely rajaraja had not intended for sucha colapse?<br />  at rajendra&#39;s time wouldnt the people have predicted a 1000 year <br />rule <br />  for the cholas.<br />  <br />  what happened??<br />  <br />  venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Yes, that is what I read too. During the fag end of the term of <br />Kulothunga I, the Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana did invade the Chola <br />Kingdom and caused a significant damage to the credentials of the <br />Cholas. Probably that was only a spark. But looking at the history, <br />it is clear that, inspite of this, the Cholas were able to hold on <br />with authority, for atleast another 3 or 4 generations until <br />Kulothunga III and then the actual disintegration / decline started.<br /><br />Regarding, losing the patronage of the Vaishnavas after the <br />Chidambaram incident, I would only say that it was insignificant. <br />Looking back, the Tamizh Vaishnavas were never a dictating force in <br />history. Yes they lacked the number to dictate anything. And <br />moreover, it was not democracy then, but monarchy. Both these facts, <br />indicate that there was not a big problem due to the incident, that <br />the decline would have started. <br /><br />Definitely the "comparative", I repeat, the "comparative" <br />incompetency of the successors of RajaRaja and Rajendra were the <br />main reasons, like in case of any other dynasty. In fact, it was <br />recorded that even Rajendra I did not have a peaceful reign and had <br />to involve himself in a lot of "instigated" wars, though he won all <br />or most of them. But this was just indicative of the fact that his <br />enemies were not some incompetent bunch of local landlords and they <br />were a "power" by themselves who could not be discarded. <br /><br />All these combined efforts of the common enemies + the "comparative <br />incompetency" of the subsequent Chola Kings could have been the <br />natural cause of a decline.<br /><br />Regarding SundaraPandyan returning the attack on Kulonthunga III <br />within 3 years, I dont think there was any impossibilities in it. As <br />can be seen from the fact that Narasimhavarman I returned the attack <br />on Pulikesi in 9 years, Sundara Pandyan did it in 3 years. The <br />lesser number of years somewhat indicate a rapid decline in the <br />competencies of Kulothunga III.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivaram Kannan" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But there is more to it ...<br />   <br />    The intelligence of Rajaraja I & Rajendra I was missing in<br />    Kulothunga I.<br />   <br />  <br />  Isn&#39;t Kulothunga I is also considered as a great king.

That's all. After reading about deeply in recent times, i even vouch <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, the best among Indian Kings.<br />&nbsp;<br />At the same time, K-1 did some great job in retaining the kingdom to thegreat extend as imagined by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>. He ruled more than 50 years with iron fist. He&nbsp; establish the federal system based on&nbsp; <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s formation. <br />&nbsp;<br />One small addition on K-2: He was not leaning&nbsp;towards jainism in the earlier days too. As per Umapatisivam's works, K-2 was interested in Srungaara rasa part of Sivakasinthaamani, when Sekkizhaar inturrupted and explained about sivanadiyaars which led to 'Thiruththondarpuraanam. Srunggaara Rasam, in general, is enjoyable for every one and Kings were not exception. Then Sivakasinthamani, (I read) is such a classical work, and not at all&nbsp;a surprise that it has got such a fame. <br />&nbsp;<br />No doubt, the author was a jain. Even the Jain mutts opposed Sivakasinthamani works and doubt the quality of truthful as he was a pure aesthetic jain sage and accused him that after experiencing the srungaaram, he has written the work. The story goes like that - the author denied the accusation but was asked to put his hands into fire, if he was a true sage. He came outvery clean after the fire-test and his classic work was also accepted.<br />&nbsp;<br />Regarding chola's decline:<br />&nbsp;<br />"THEETHUM NANDRUM PIRAR THARA VAARAA" <br />&nbsp;<br />Dhivakar<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />--- On Thu, 8/5/08, Sivapathasekaran &lt;sps10142004@yahoo..co.in&gt; wrote:<br />From: Sivapathasekaran &lt;sps10142004@...&gt;Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: decline of the cholasTo:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comDate">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comDate</a><!-- e -->: Thursday, 8 May, 2008, 1:15 AM<br /><br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "R.venketesh" &lt;abhivencat@ ...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Hi&gt; &gt; the cholas within a century and a half from their pinnacle were &gt; iretrievably on the decline.&gt; their enemies had strengthened, their teritories had shrunk.&gt; many reasons could be attributed. &gt; did the decline start with the govindaraja episode? not the curse but &gt; had they alieanated a portion of their people?&gt; or because the cholas had become telugu and lost the loyalty of the &gt; tamil population?&gt; how come? surely rajaraja had not intended for sucha colapse?&gt; at rajendra's time wouldnt the people have predicted a 1000 year rule &gt; for the cholas.&gt; &gt; what happened??============ ========= ========= ========= =====&gt; THE USUAL RE-CYCLING<br />..Let us recall from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> :In 850 Ad Vijayalaya was a Commander.. assisted Pallava..

Kandraditha - Sundara - Aditha Karikala - Uthama episode is discussed in Ponniyinselvan widely by Kalki.We have seen the roles of Kurunila mannargal with Authority.Rajaraja handled them effectively and curtailed their Authority, but reinforced matrimonial relationships ..Rajendra I handled Pandyas more effectively creating CHOLA - PANDYAS, by positioning offsprings of such alliances ..We have discussed Rajendra I's children already in detail (about 40 year rule).In 1070 Kulothunga I came to Power. Rajaraja I's daughter Kundavai + Vimaladithan' s son married to Rajendra's<br />granddaughter and Vikramaditha VI was renamed as Kulothunga I.
