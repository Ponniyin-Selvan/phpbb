No body knows for certain, from <br />where they came into South Indian peninsula to upset and uproot the <br />Adhirajas of Chera, Chola and Pandya dynasties who were ruling the <br />lands of present day Tamilnadu and Kerala state. Every historian <br />tried their best to throw some light on these valiant and powerful <br />rulers with what ever little evidences they managed to gather from <br />known historical sources. <br /><br />The only sources available to the historians are the jain and <br />buddhist literature. The kalabhras ruled South Indian peninsula for <br />about 300 years which is not a small time from the point of history <br />but the history of this kalabhra period was completely a dark <br />chapter. So the period of kalabhra rule in South Indian history was <br />termed by historians as "DARK AGE". <br />It is believed that the brahmins, who were treated very badly by the <br />kalbhra kings by snatching away the rights of brahmins over the <br />brahmadeya lands given to them and to their Hindu Gods, got <br />antagonised. It is said that the brahmin epigraphists either <br />distroyed the history of kalabhras or twisted it beyond normal <br />understanding of common people. Some historians said that they were <br />the kings who brought Jainism to Tamil country and some other <br />historians were of the view that they were buddhists during whose <br />rule buddhism flourished in South India. Though historians are found <br />to have various openions about these misterious warrior and ruling <br />class people, they all agreed on one common thing about the <br />kalabhras that they were verile, ferocious, terrible and ruthless <br />conquerors.<br /><br />Prof., Ramaswami Ayangar asserts :<br /><br />Many Pallava and Pandya writings describe that the Kalabhras <br />attacked the Tamil country and defeated the Cholas, Cheras and <br />Pandyas and established their kingdom. Prof., Ramaswami Ayangar <br />asserts that these valiant Kalabhra kings were the devoted followers <br />of Jainism. Basically, Kalchuri kings were supporters of Jainism. He <br />proved it on the basis of copper plate of Veluikudi and <br />Painyapuranam of Tamil language. Jainism flourished after their <br />reaching in Tamil country. Shri Ayangar presumes that these <br />Kalabhras were a branch of Kalchuri clan. The Kalchuri kings of M.P. <br />wore supporters of Jainism. The evidence on this is that they were <br />closely related to Rashtrakuta. The Rashtrakuta kings had their <br />faith in Jainism. The influence of Jainism during reign of Kalchuri <br />kings of Kalyani was perceptible. The prominent king Vijjala of this <br />clan and his several statesmen had adopted Jainism. Rechmayya, the <br />minister of Kalchuri State set up the image of Tirthankar Shantinath <br />at Shravanabelagola. <br /><br />Dr. Aiyangar observes: <br /><br />"The Andhra rulers...had an alternative capital in the basin of <br />lower Krishna at Amaravati wherefrom they stretched south wards, <br />and, perhaps at one time, made an effort to extend their authority <br />successfully even down to the southern Pennar..." The gradual <br />pressure from the Andhra Empire seems to have set up a popular <br />movement resulting in the migration of the somewhat less civilized <br />people who seem to have completely upset the Governments of South <br />India and introduced what may well be regarded as a period of <br />anarchy to which later inscriptions refer to in unmistakable terms. <br />This is the movement of the people called Kalvar or Kalavar, and <br />they must have moved down from the region round and about Vengadam, <br />if not from the whole of Tondamandalam. ..." Kalabhras fought <br />against Brahmin supremacy and were abused by Brahmin epigraphists <br />after their rule ended. <br /><br />Shri K.A.N. Sastri has the following to say about them: <br /><br />"A long historical night ensure after the close of the Sangam age. <br />We know little of the period of more than three centuries that <br />followed. When the curtain rises again towards the close of the <br />sixth century A.D., we find a mysterious and ubiquitous enemy of <br />civilization, the evil rulers called Kalabhras (Kalappalar), have <br />come and upset the established political order which was restored <br />only by their defeat at the hands of the Pandyas and Pallavas as <br />well as the Chalukyas of Badami. <br /><br />Of the Kalabhras we have yet no definite knowledge; from some <br />Buddhist books we hear of a certain Acchutavikkanta of the <br />Kalabharakula during whose reign Buddhist monasteries and authors <br />enjoyed most patronage in the Chola country. Late literary tradition <br />in Tamil avers that he kept in confinement the three Tamil kings - <br />the Chera, Chola and Pandya. Some songs about him are quoted by <br />Amitasagara, a Jain grammarian of Tamil of the tenth century A.D. <br />Possibly Acchuta was himself a Buddhist, a political revolution <br />which the Kalabhras effected was provoked by religious antagonism.<br /><br />At any rate the Kalabhras are roundly denounced as evil king (kali-<br />arasar) who uprooted many adhirajas and abrogated brahmdeya rights; <br />there was no love lost between these interlopers and the people of <br />the lands they overran. The Cholas disappeared from the Tamil land <br />almost completely in this debacle, though a branch of them can be <br />tranced towards the close of the period in Rayalaseema, the Telugu <br />Cholas, whose kingdom is mentioned by Yuan Chwang in the seventh <br />century A.D.". <br /><br />" The upset of the existing order due to the Kalabhras must have <br />affected the Chera country as well, though there is little evidence <br />on this country in this period apart from the late legend of the <br />Keralotpatti and Keralamahatyam. According to these, the rulers of <br />the land had to be imported from neighbouring countries, and they <br />assumed the title of Perumal. Possibly the Vaishnava saint <br />Kulasekhara Alvar was one of these Perumals; in his poems he claims <br />sovereignty over Chera, Chola and Pandya, besides the Kongu country <br />and Kolli mountain. His age cannot be determined with any certainty, <br />though a date as early as the sixth century has been suggested for <br />him, on the ground that at no later period could this claim to rule <br />over Pandya and Chola be plausible. It seems more likely, however, <br />that this claim was merely rhetorical, and that he belonged to a <br />much later time, say ninth century A.D.".<br /><br />"This dark period marked by the ascendancy of Buddhism, and probably <br />also Jainism, was characterized also by great literary activity in <br />Tamil. Most of the works grouped under the head, 'The Eighteen Minor <br />works' were written during this period as also the Silappadhikaran, <br />Manimekhalai and other works. Many of the authors were the votaries <br />of the `heretical' (meaning Buddhists and Jains) sects." <br /><br />Kalabhras were Buddhists: <br /><br />About these so called `wicked' Kalabhras, R. Sathinathaier observes; <br /><br />"We have already made a few references to the Kalabhras, and to <br />their king Achchutavikranta. The Velvikudi plates of the third <br />regnal year of Ndunjadaiyan Pandya (c.765 - c.815) say that <br />Palyagamudukudumi - Peruvaludi Pandyadhiraja gave the village of <br />Velvikudi as brahmadeya (gift to a brahmana). It was enjoyed for <br />long. Then a Kali king named Kalabhran took possession of the <br />extensive earth, driving away numberless great kings (adiraja), and <br />resumed the (village mentioned) above.<br /><br />After that...the Pandyadhiraja Kodungon recovered the territory <br />under the Kalabhra occupation. It would appear from the brief <br />account that the Pandya country was seized by the Kalabhras long <br />after Mudukudumi. They overthrew many adhirajas and resumed even <br />brahmdeya lands. Thus they were terrible and ruthless conquerors. <br />Their sway was put an end to by Kodungon, who may be assigned <br />conjecturally to c.590 - 620. There are other references to the <br />Kalabhras in Pallava and Chalukya inscriptions; they are said to <br />have been conquered by Simhavishnu and Narasimha Varman-I and by <br />Vikramaditya-I and II." <br /><br />"The identification of the Kalabhras is very difficult problem of <br />South Indian History. (i) They have been identified with the line of <br />Muttaraiyar of Kondubalur (8 A.D to 11 A.D). (ii) Others regard them <br />as Karnatas on the strength of a reference in Tamil literature to <br />the rule of a Karnata king over Madura. (iii) A third view is that <br />the Kalabhras were Kalappalar, belonging to Vellala community and <br />referred to in Tamil literature and inscriptions. <br /><br />But the most satisfactory theory identifies the Kalabhras with the <br />Kalavar, and the chieftains of this tribe mentioned in Sangam <br />literature are Tiraiyan of Pavattiri and Pulli of Vengadam or <br />Tirupati. The latter is described as the cattle lifting robber chief <br />of the frontier. The Kalavar must have been dislodged from their <br />habitat near Tirupati by political events of the 3 A.D., viz. the <br />fall of the Satvahanas and the rise of Pallavas, as well as by the <br />invasion of Dakshinapatha by Samudragupta in the following century, <br />resulting in political confusion in Tondamandalam. The Kalabhra <br />invasion must have overwhelmed the Pallavas, the Cholas and the <br />Pandyas." <br /><br />Kalabhras =  kalabars =  Kalavar =  kalvar<br />kalavar  kalappalar =  kalappirar <br /><br />"Despite the various explanations given above, the Kalabhras cannot <br />but be regarded as mysterious people who convulsed the affairs of <br />the Tamil country for a few centuries. Achchutavikranta caused the <br />dispersal of the Cholas. In the Pandya country even brahmdeya gifts <br />were not treated as sacrosanct by the predatory Kalabhras. <br />Ultimately their power was broken by Kodungon Pandya and Simhavishnu <br />Pallava, and Chalukya campaigns against them in the 7 A.D and 8 A.D" <br /><br />" The Muttaraiyar and Kodunabnalar chiefs of Kalabhra origin, <br />according to one view, were feudatory to the Pallavas and the <br />Pandyas respectively, and in the contest between two powers, they <br />fought on opposite sides. The Muttaraiyar ruled over Tanjore and <br />Pudukkotai as the feudatories of the Pallavas from the 8 A.D to 11 <br />A.D. There is a reference to Perumbidugu - Muttaraiyan- II who <br />attended the coronation of Nandivarman Pallavamlla. One of the <br />titles of the Muttaraiyar was Lord of Tanjore. Vijayalaya Chola, who <br />conquered Tanjore from a Muttaraiyan in the 9 A.D., was a Pallava <br />feudatory. A vindication of the law of nemesis is discernible in the <br />victory of a Chola chief over a descendant of the Kalabhras who had <br />overthrown the earlier Chola kingdom." <br /><br />" The history of Cholas of Uraiyur (near Trichinoply) is exceedingly <br />obscure from 4 A.D to 9 A.D., chiefly owing to the occupation of <br />their country by the Kalabhras. Buddhadatta, the great writer in <br />Pali, belonged to Uraiyur. He mentions his contemporary, King <br />Achchutavikranta of the Kalabharakula, as ruling over the Chola <br />country from Kaveripatnam. He was a Buddhist, Tamil literary <br />tradition refers to an Achchuta who kept the Chera, Chola and Pandya <br />king in captivity. On the basis of the contemporaneity of Buddhdatta <br />with Buddhaghosha, Achchuta may be assigned to the 5 A.D. Thus after <br />the Sangam age, the descendants of karikala Chola were forced into <br />obscurity by the Kalabhras, who disturbed the placid political <br />conditions of the Tamil country." <br /><br />Woraiyur , a part of present day Tiruchirappalli, was the capital <br />city of Cholas from 300 B.C. onwards. This is supported by <br />archaeological evidences and ancient literatures. There are also <br />literary sources which tell that Woraiyur continued to be under the <br />control of Cholas even during the days of Kalabhra interregnum (A.D. <br />300 - 575). <br /><br />According to 'Chulavamsa', Buddhadatta and Budhaghosa are certainly <br />represented as contamporaries. The formar belongs to Uragapura <br />[Uraiyur] near modern Trichinopoly in South India. He himself speaks <br />patriotically of the kingdom of Cola and associates his literary <br />activity with the reign of Accutavikkanata or Accutavikkama of the <br />Kalabbha or Kalamba [kadamba] dynasty. The vinaya - vinicchaya at <br />its end describes that Buddhadatta of Uragapura wrote it. The <br />Abhidhammavatara at its end also refers to it. <br /><br />kalabhra =  kalabbha =  kalamba =  kadamba<br /><br />He is said to have flourished when king Accutavikkanta of the <br />Kalamba (Kadamba) dynasty was one the throne. It is difficult to <br />identify King Accuta or Accutavikkanta (Acyta Vikrama) of Kalabhra <br />or the Kadamba dynasty. But the Kalabhras once made a great <br />influence over the Chola territory and Simhavishnu, the Pallava <br />king, defeated them in late sixth century. Colian king Acytavikranta <br />or Acytavikrama who is described as 'Kalambakulnandana' <br />or 'Kalabbhakulanandana' (also Vaddhana).<br /><br />Alvara's views :<br /><br />Raghavacharya, who assigns date prior to that of Sankaracharya, to <br />all Alvars, mentions that according to Poygai Alvar, the Vengadam <br />hill was the habitat of elephants, which the "Kuravars" or "Kurbas" <br />who inhabited or frequented the hill used to capture and tame and <br />also scare away huge pythons. He observes that, the Tamil term <br />Kuravar used by the early Alvars is corruption of "Kuraba", who were <br />residents of this area and also of Kurnool, Mysore, Salem, Koimbtore <br />and the Nilgiris. He mentions the names of Kurubalakota, <br />Kurubalpatti, Kuruba Nagalapuram, Kurumba Palayam, Kurumbapatti, <br />Kurumbharhalli etc. in various areas. He says Kurabas or Kuravar <br />were a verile people, who were in possession of Tirumalai Hills and <br />surrounding area before Pallavas conquerred it. <br /><br />kalabhras =  karabhras =  kurabhras = kurabas<br />kurabars  kuravars<br />kurubas  kuruvas<br /><br />kalabhras were from Tondamandalam :<br /><br />Thus it is clear that the people around Tondamandalam were Nagas, <br />though the name Naga is now a days restricted to a few groups of <br />people and not applicable to the whole race unlike in pre-Aryan <br />times, but the fact remains that those Naga tribes who are mentioned <br />above were Buddhists, as that was the original area of Kalabhras. <br />Thus we find that this area was under the influence of Buddhists <br />before the coming up of the Brahmin culture and was free from the <br />caste rivalries. It was forming the part of Asokan empire, and <br />consequently had the advantages of all the religious reforms brought <br />in by Asoka. In later times it came under the Satvahanas who were <br />also having friendly relations towards Buddhism. Nagarjuna's <br />relations with Satvahana king are well known. <br /><br />The local people were the Pullis and Tiraiyan of Pavattiri and these <br />so called less civilized Kalavar people later migrated from the land <br />of Tondamandalam to southward areas and caused so called anarchy and <br />got designated as wicked by the Brahmin epigraphists. And these <br />Kalabars were the same as Kalabhras, and were Buddhists. The whole <br />situation boils down to one thing that during the period from <br />Satvahanas to the ascendancy of Imperial Pallavas and even in later <br />times the area of Tondamandalam was inhabited by the Buddhist people <br />and ruled by the Buddhist kings, initially under the Satvahanas and <br />later independently, and not only that but they ruled whole of South <br />India for about three centuries. And these Kalabhras were termed <br />as 'uncivilized', 'wicked' and by all sorts of abuses, and their <br />history suppressed, only evidences remaining extant in Buddhist <br />books, i.e. whatever was left of these books. The real bone of <br />contention seems to be that they cancelled the rights of the <br />Brahmins from the brahmdeya villages, i.e. the villages gifted to <br />Brahmins. <br /><br />The Dark age or the Kalabhra Interegnum (A.D. 150 - 500) : <br /><br />The rule of Kalabhras was termed as Dark Age. Rulers of Vengadam <br />were Kalabhras who were Buddhists. These Kalavars are the same as <br />Kalabhras. When Satvahanas put pressure on them, these anti-<br />Brahmanic Buddhist people who were ruling around Tirupati migrated <br />to whole of South India and ruled most of it for centuries, and <br />these centuries are now termed by Brahmin historians as `dark age', <br />not only because scanty information is available from Brahmanic <br />sources but also because it was anti-Brahmanic age. They were abused <br />by the Brahmins and their history was wiped out. But the Buddhist <br />books still preserve their history. <br /><br />It is clear that the Kalvar chieftains Pullis and Tiraiyans of <br />Pavattiri are people of one and the same stock, i.e. of <br />Kalabharakula, as already seen. They were all Buddhists and they <br />migrated south wards and uprooted various kings. There was religious <br />animosity with Brahmins, villages gifted to whom were cancelled by <br />them and consequently they were abused by Brahmin epigraphists. In <br />spite of all this it seems Brahmins could not get rid of the name of <br />Tondaman who finds a place in the Puranas as founder of Tirupati. We <br />have to remember that Pullis, Tiraiyans, Tondamans represent people <br />rather than individuals, and that all these people being the same, <br />one could see how Tondaman is designated as 'Chakravarthi' when in <br />story itself he was described as no more than a small chieftain. At <br />the same time, the Kalabhras who were the same people, when they <br />uprooted various kings and convulsed the great Emperors for <br />centuries, are designated as 'wicked', 'kali-asar' etc. simply <br />because they had to depict these people in the first place as <br />devotees of Brahmanism and in the second place as enemies of <br />Brahmanism. Such is the mentality and scholarship of our elites. <br /><br />kali =  kala =  black <br />asar =  asur =  demon<br />kali asar =  black demon<br /><br />After the Sangam Age, Kerala passed through a dark period that <br />lasted four centuries. This era is known as the 'Kalabhra <br />Interregnum'. At the end of the 8 A.D., South Indian kingdoms such <br />as the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas and the Pandyas <br />succeeded in overthrowing the Kalabhras.<br /><br />Kalabhra interregnum is called as 'dark period' because it is so <br />called by earliest Pallava and Medieval Pandya sources. While the <br />sangam period shows many religions entering from the North into <br />Tamilakam (Kerala+TN), no religion was that dominant and varnashrama <br />system was not at all fully entrenched. Jains did yeoman service to <br />foster Tamil grammar. 95% of the earliest Tamil inscrptions called <br />Tamil Brahmi are for the sake of Jain ascetics. These inscriptions <br />are very short, one or two lines only. <br /><br />Kalabhra interregnum is called as 'dark period' because it is so <br />called by earliest Pallava and Medieval Pandya sources.

Pallavas and Medieval Pandyas, who <br />accepted the varnashrama and Brahmanical orthodoxy, completely <br />routed out the "heterodox" religions. Both Buddhism and Jainism were <br />practically extinguished. Hence, these "orthodox" sources portray <br />Kalabhra period as "dark period". <br /><br />But the Kalabhra period is very important: It represents a break <br />from ancient Tamil society of Sangam period. Sangam poetry marks a <br />period where writing and literacy were introduced into Tamil. <br />Probably by Jains. Sangam poetry is great because it is the first <br />flowering of Tamil ideas and Tamil literature never could match <br />sangam period's freshness and free thoughts after contact with <br />Northern religions. Sangam poetry is the only poetry among *all* <br />Indian writings that is mostly independent of the Vedic / Sanskrit <br />tradition. Though progressively sanskritized in later stages. Hence, <br />sangam letters' importance to understand ancient India is on par <br />with the oldest sanskrit texts. Kalabhras, the flag-bearers of <br />heteredoxy, sponsored such works as TirukkuRaL, NaalaDiyAr, <br />CilappatikAram, Manimekalai, ... How could it be "dark period"? But <br />the sources from Brahmanical orthodoxy of the Bhakti era (eg., <br />PeriyapurANam in 12th century) says definitely say Kalabhras were <br />cruel. Bhakti era represents a synthesis and homogenization by <br />nonbrahmin elites and incoming brahmins. It is called as priest-<br />peasant collaboration. Saiva Vellalas are called "sad-shUdras" (good <br />shUdras). This brahmin-vellala alliance is seen clearly in Pallava-<br />Chola inscriptions. This theory was first propounded by Burton <br />Stein. He called it the "segmentary state" theory. He showed that <br />Neelakanta Sastri and other Indians concentrated so much on <br />individual kings, their dates, their ruling period, but really these <br />South Indian (and Southeast Asian to a large extent) states <br />are "segmentary" in nature. The strategy of the Kings was to place <br />the Brahmin settlements to bring homogenization to an extent <br />possible. <br /><br />More about kalabhras : <br /><br />Kalabhras attacked and defeated Tamil Kings who were persecuting <br />Jains. During the rule of Kalabhra kings, Jainism attained supermacy <br />in Tamil Nadu. As followers of Jainism they prohibited animal <br />sacrifices in rituals. We find that most of the invasions on the <br />Tamil country were from Karnataka. It began with the Kalabhra <br />invasions around 250 A. D., and their pillage over the Tamil country <br />for over three centuries. Then came the Chlaukya, Hoysala, and <br />Vijayanagara Nayakka invasions on the Tamil land. The Telugu <br />Pallavas ruled over theTamils after the Kalabhras.<br /><br />While the march of the mighty oceans have destroyed the early Tamils <br />and their way of life, the Kalabhra invasion during 250 A.D. <br />decidely altered the shape of Tamil leterature and Tamil way of <br />life. Kalabharas, having been the sons of the Kannada soil did not <br />have the necessary love of Tamil to ensure its growth. Instead the <br />pronounced Jainest fanatism of these rulers have more or less <br />destroyed the acts and literature of the Tamil people to the point <br />of extinction. However various treatises on Poetics began to be <br />written along with some of the ethical works which are grouped in <br />Pathinenkil Kanakku. The most illustrious flower of the Dark Ages is <br />probably the 'Muthollayiram' 900 songs each on the Chera, Chola and <br />the Pandya Kings.<br /><br />Kalabhras (Kalavars) captured power from the three traditional <br />crowned monarchs and ruled the whole or considerable parts of Tamil <br />Nadu for about three hundred years, roughly from 250 to 550 AD. This <br />Kalabhra interregnum paved the way to put an end to the primacy of <br />Tamil culture and language under the regimes that fofllowed - the <br />Pallavas in the northern and the Pandyas in southern parts of Tamil <br />country. Dominance of Sanskritic - Brahminical -Hindu religio-<br />cultural way of life and social organisation prevailed for more than <br />1500 years. Not only under Pallavas and later Pandyas, but also <br />under later Cholas, Vijayanar Emperors, Nayak rulers, Maratha kings, <br />and Rajas of southern principalities, the same condition continued <br />with greater sway. Even the regimes under the Nizams of Hyderabad <br />and Nawabs of Carnatic (Karai Naadu) could not get rid of the socio-<br />religious scheme of Varna Dharma and the consequent domination of <br />the Brahmins and Brahminical upper castes.<br /><br />Under Kalabhra patronage, Tamil Jains produced literature in <br />Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit, and Tamil. The notion of an academy of <br />poets (cankam, Indo-Aryan sangha), later collectively applied to the <br />authors of the early Tamil anthologies, appears to have been modeled <br />on the Jain academy established in Madurai. Jains were among the <br />most important authors of Tamil literature between the first and <br />sixth centuries. In this period, Jains introduced didactic genres <br />into Tamil literature, producing the most important ethical texts in <br />Tamil, including several works among the eighteen shorter classics. <br />In this group is included Tiruvalluvar's Kural (or Tirukkural), the <br />best known ethical text in Tamil.<br /><br />Kalappirar are Jains, and appear to have come from Karnataka, a Jain <br />strong hold. During the Kalabhra period, heterodoxy, opposed to <br />Brahmanical orthodoxy, reigned supreme. Pallavas and Medieval <br />Pandyas, who accepted the varnashrama and Brahmanical orthodoxy, <br />completely routed out the "heterodox" religions. Both Buddhism and <br />Jainism were practically extinguished.

But the sources from Brahmanical orthodoxy of <br />the Bhakti era (eg., PeriyapurANam in 12th century) says definitely <br />say Kalabhras were cruel. <br /><br />The Pallavas became dominant in the 6th century after a successful <br />attack against the Kalabhras, which extended their territory as far <br />south as the Kaveri River.<br /><br /><br />Important Information about Kalabhras :<br /><br />Identification of the Kalabhras is very difficult problem of South <br />Indian History. <br />Some identify Kalabhras with the line of Muttaraiyar of Kondubalur. <br />Some regard kalabhras as kalappalars of Vellala community. <br />Some identify kalabhras with kalvar chieftains of Tiraiyan tribe <br />from Tirupati. <br />Some regard kalabhras as Karnatas on the strength of a reference in <br />Tamil literature. <br />A Karnata king ruled over Madura. <br />Muttaraiyars of Kondubalur were the rulers between 800 A.D to 1100 <br />A.D) <br />Shri Ayangar presumes that the Kalabhras were a branch of Kalchuri <br />clan. <br />Shri K.A.N Sastri says that the Kalabhras ruled South India till <br />about the end of 600 A.D <br />Sangam Tamil Classics refer to kalabhras as semi-barbarian & <br />ferocious stock of people <br />Kalabhras were referred to roam around and beyond the Venkadam <br />(Thirupathi) hills. <br />Kalabhras served as mercenaries to many of the ancient States such <br />as Mauryas. <br />Kalabhras migrated from tirupati to further South and ruled it for <br />300 years. <br />Buddhist books say that Acchutavikkanta of the Kalabharakula was a <br />great king <br />Acchutavikkanta kept in confinement three Tamil kings- Chera, Chola <br />and Pandya. <br />Achchutavikranta caused the dispersal of the Cholas <br />The Cholas disappeared from the Tamil land almost completely. <br />Acchutavikkanta ruled over Chola country. <br />Buddhadatta mentions that Achchutavikranta ruled from Kaveripatnam <br />Acchutavikkanta patronised Buddhist monasteries and & authors. <br />Possibly Acchuta was himself a Buddhist. <br />Achchuta may be assigned to the 500 A.D. <br />A Kali king named Kalabhran took possession of the extensive earth <br />after 815 A.D. <br />Kalabhran had driven away numberless great kings (adiraja) <br />King Kalabhran resumed Velvikudi, a brahmadeya village. <br />Kalabhras uprooted many adhirajas. <br />Kalbhras abrogated brahmdeya rights. <br />In Pandya country brahmdeya gifts were not treated as sacrosanct by <br />the Kalabhras. <br />Kalabhras effected a political revolution, which was due to <br />religious antagonism. <br />Kalabhras sponsored great works such as TirukkuraL, Naaladiyar, <br />Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai, etc. <br />Kalabhras attacked and defeated Tamil Kings who were persecuting <br />Jains. <br />During the rule of Kalabhra kings, Jainism attained supermacy in <br />Tamil Nadu. <br />As followers of Jainism they prohibited animal sacrifices in <br />rituals. <br />Kalabhras convulsed the affairs of the Tamil country for a few <br />centuries. <br />Kalabhra period of 300 years was termed by historians as "Dark age". <br />The " Dark Age " was marked by the ascendancy of Buddhism, and also <br />Jainism. <br />The " Dark Age " was also characterized by great literary activity <br />in Tamil. <br />Kalabhras opposed to Brahmanical orthodoxy during their rule. <br />Under Kalabhra rule, heterodoxy, opposed to Brahmanical orthodoxy, <br />reigned supreme. <br />Kalabhras were the flag-bearers of heteredoxy. <br />The period : 300 A.D - 575 A.D was known as Dark Age / Kalabhra <br />interregnum. <br />Kalabhras were anti-Brahmanic Buddhist people. <br />Kalabhras were roundly denounced as evil kings (kali-asar) <br />Brahman epigraphists denounced kalabhras as kala-asar (Black Demons) <br />Kalabhra power broken by Kodungon Pandya and Simhavishnu Pallava in <br />late 600 A.D. <br />Chalukya campaigned against them in the 700 A.D and 800 A.D. <br />Mutharaiyars of kondunabalur were feudatory to the Pallavas and the <br />Pandyas. <br />Muttaraiyar ruled over Tanjore and Pudukkotai from the 800 A.D to <br />1100 A.D <br />Mutharaiyars, in the contest between pallavas and pandyas, fought on <br />opposite sides. <br />Perumbidugu - Muttaraiyan- II attended the coronation of Nandivarman <br />Pallavamlla. <br />One of the titles of the Muttaraiyar was Lord of Tanjore. <br />Vijayalaya Chola conquered Tanjore from a Muttaraiyan in the 9 A.D. <br />Kalabhras and vadugars were one and the same people : <br /><br />We find in the Sangam Tamil Classics frequent references to a semi-<br />barbarian and ferocious stock of people who roamed around beyond the <br />Venkadam (Thirupathi) hills. They served as mercenaries to many of <br />the ancient States, particularly the Mauryas. They were called <br />Vadugar in Tamil classics. These Vadugar got split into Eastern <br />Vadugar and Western Vadugar. The Eastern Vadugar gradually became <br />Telugus. The Western Vadugar, who were called as KÃ³Â³Â¡Â² in the Sangam <br />literature, became the Kannadigas. The northern fraction of these KÃ³Â³Â¡Â² <br />were called as MÃ¢Â²Â¡ttar; and they became the Marathis later. The <br />northern segment of the Telugu Vadugar in Kalinga broke into Oddars <br />or Oriyas. The first ever territory that the KÃ³Â³Â¡Â² or the Kannada <br />Vadugar occupied in the former Chera country was the TulunÃ¢Â¤Âµ, as the <br />Tamil literary evidences tell. <br /><br />Then they came down to the present Mysore, then called as <br />Erumainadu. It was thus called as it was conquered by a Vadugan <br />called Erumai. He participated in the Thalaiyalankanam battle <br />against Pandyan Nedunchezhiyan of the Sangam Age. The successive <br />invasions of these Vadugar barbarians and their overrunning the <br />Chera, Chola and Pandya empires of the antiquity was the cause for <br />the fall of the Tamils and their subjugation and classification into <br />low class aborigines. Brahmanism, as an apartheid way of life, in <br />fact, had its origin only in the Chera country (Kerala) through the <br />legendary person in Parasurama. Whereas the Aryan concept had its <br />root in the north. The British colonial intellect confused <br />Brahmanism with Aryanism, and had imposed a false historiography by <br />branding Brahmanism as an import from the north. Though born down <br />the extreme south in the Chera country, Brahmanism was carried into <br />the Chola and Pandya countries only through the Kannada and Telugu <br />(or the Vadugar) Brahmans. Manu Smruti, which was written in <br />Karnataka, was adopted as the social code by the court of Pulikesi <br />II, the Chalukya monarch. The Chalukyan epigraphical eulogies of <br />manavakula or Manava Dharma would show it. It was the Vadugar <br />colonisers who imposed birth-based caste discriminations and <br />untouchability on the Tamils in the Chola and Pandya States. <br /><br />Kalabhras were anti-Brahmin :<br /><br />Buddhists and Jains had flourished amicably along with Hindu Sects <br />even during the Ca?kam age. But when Buddhism got catapulted into <br />ascendency, under the Kalabhras, "a rather mysterious and ubiquitous <br />enemy of civilization" who swept over the Tamil Country and ruled it <br />for over the two hundred years following the close of the Ca?kam age <br />in 3 century A.D., a hectic fury of religious hatred and rivalry was <br />unleashed.<br /><br />(1). The active propagation of Buddhism by the ruling Kalabhras, who <br />are denounced in the Veluikudi grants of the Pandyas (9 century <br />A.D ) as evil kings (kali-asar) who uprooted many Adhirajas and <br />confiscated the properties gifted to Gods (temples) and Brahmins.<br /><br />(2), provoked the adherents of Siva and Vishnu to make organized <br />attempts to stall the rising tide of heresy. Hatred of Buddhists and <br />Jains was openly declared. "Challenges to public debate, <br />competitions in the performance of miracles, tests of truth of <br />doctrines by means of ordeals became the order of the day".<br /><br />(3). The overthrow of the Kalabhras in the late 6 A.d dealt the <br />final blow to the decline of Buddhism in India. The rise of the <br />Pallavas and Pandyas once again in the Tamil Country accelerated the <br />Hindu revivalist movement. The Saiva saint poets of this period <br />among whom were the four founder saints of Saiva Siddhanta of the <br />Tamil Country all actively sought to reconvert the rulers from the <br />heretical faiths. The great Pallava king Mahendravarman I. (580-630 <br />A.D.) is reported to have been reclaimed for Saivism by Appar, who <br />had himself been reclaimed from Jainism earlier by his sister.<br /><br />Kalabhras antagonised brahmins by snatching away the brahmadeya <br />lands :<br /><br />The tradition about the Kalabhra inroads seems to convey some sense <br />in the context of the disappearance of the ruling lineages: Cera, <br />Cola and Pandya. Kalabhras were a predatory people belonging to the <br />uplands of Karnataka. It appears that the predatory marches <br />continuing from earlier times culminated in the Kalabhra inroads and <br />brought about a major change, the memory of which reminded the <br />brahmans of the evils of Kaliyuga, as evidenced by some of later <br />copper plates. The Kilkanakku texts probably belonging to the 4th-<br />5th centuries A.D. stress the significance of peace, obedience, <br />loyalty and morality. This presupposes the existence of a situation <br />that badly needed such aspects of social morality and good conduct. <br /><br />Whatever the nature of the chaos, the end of the period of chaos was <br />marked by the steady growth of wet-land agriculture through the <br />emergence of brahman settlements which meant the growth and <br />crystallisation of a new system of social relations. A brahmadeya is <br />never referred to in the actual text of the poems, but their <br />colophons which are relatively later, do refer to it. The existence <br />of brahman settlements is attested by allusions to them seen in some <br />of the Pattupattu songs like Perumpanarruppatai. <br /><br />The Pulankurichchi rock inscription, probably of late 4th century <br />A.D. is the first known record that refers to a brahmadeya village <br />in Tamilakam. The brahman village represented by the inscription is <br />a fully evolved agrarian unit with structured land relations and <br />service bound settlers. The process of this evolution is not known. <br />Some of the early copper plates while referring to the history of <br />the gift villages mention that they were originally ekabhoga-<br />brahmadeyas and lost in the wake of the Kalabhra raids. Subsequently <br />when the lost villages were restored to the heirs of the original <br />donees, they were converted into corporate brahmadeyas. This would <br />suggest that a crucial phase in the process was the transformation <br />of individual brahman households into corporate settlements. Kerala <br />which has no records of brahmadeya villages seems to suggest that <br />these brahman settlements grew up on their own without any royal <br />patronage. However, land gifts to brahman poets by the Ceras are <br />mentioned in the Colophons of Patirrupattu. The later inscriptions <br />referring to brahman villages of Kerala clearly show that there was <br />also the subsequent development of brahman households into corporate <br />settlements. <br /><br />The proliferation of brahman settlements signified the institutional <br />and organisational growth and expansion of wet-land agriculture in <br />Tamilakam. It appears that the corporate managerial organs, the <br />institution of caste and the ideology of bhakti were the major means <br />that enabled the brahmans to build up a well structured peasant <br />society. Tolkapiam (Porul) the grammatical treatise probably of <br />early 6th century A.D. represents the initial phase of such society. <br />In Kerala the genesis of a similar society seems to have become <br />complete before 9th century A.D. as evidenced by the inscriptions <br />there.</div>
