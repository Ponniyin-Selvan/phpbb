He recalled a tradition that the bow <br />should be as tall as the individual, but he remembered his bows as <br />shorter, maybe 36" when braced. A couple of examples of these short <br />metal recurve bows are on display in the Government Museum of <br />Madras. Both steel and brass bows were used by members of royal <br />families in competition during the eighteenth and nineteenth <br />centuries. <br /><br />Steel bows have a long history in India, as very early texts make <br />mention of steel bows. By the time of the Mughal period (beginning <br />mid-1500s), steel bows that were highly decorated, sometimes with <br />gold and silver inlay, were fixtures in royal households. Though <br />there is evidence that steel bows were earlier used in warfare, by <br />the end of the seventeenth century of so, they may have become <br />weapons for royal display. Several sources maintain that the range <br />of a steel bow was limited in comparison with the composite bows of <br />India. However, Robert P. Elmer, in his classic work, Target <br />Archery, notes an advantage of a steel bow. Being of metal, <br />it "never needed to be unstrung and so it could be kept at hand in <br />the house as a weapon for instant defense." <br /><br />The Tanjavur raja stated he trained with a bow made out of brass, a <br />metal that many archery aficionados whom I have since spoken with <br />have questioned. But the king was emphatic: his bow was brass. He <br />may have meant bronze, as in India, the two terms are used inter-<br />changeably. <br /><br />The king described his bow as short, rounded, both in the grip and <br />along its body, and decorated with a floral motif etched in the <br />back. The ears of the bow were highly articulated, curling towards <br />the back of the bow. He also drew a picture of what he called the <br />kalasam (see figure 1), a tear-drop shaped plate projecting out from <br />the back of the bow above the grip that served to fix the aiming <br />point when shooting. He recalled the strength drawing the bow <br />required of him, noting that the extent to which a bow was drawn <br />depended upon an individual's ability. He remembered the bow string <br />being made out of animal--perhaps cow--gut. <br /><br />The raja said he has no idea what happened to the bows he remembers <br />in the palace. Simply lost is how he put it. He did remember one <br />bow that represented the royal line when his father held public <br />audiences, or durbar as it is known in India. He had an idea that <br />the bow might be found in a local goddess temple where it was <br />routinely kept, as a number of royal rituals centred around the <br />power derived from and associated with the goddess tradition. <br /><br />One important annual ritual known as Dasara comes at the end of the <br />autumn Navaratra goddess festival also called Durgapuja. In part <br />the Navaratra festival celebrates the goddess's association with <br />military success as there are several mythic accounts of the goddess <br />Durga slaying a demon to restore order in the world. The festival <br />is also associated with an episode from the Ramayana that <br />exemplifies royal military success. <br /><br />Undertaken on Vijayadasami, the tenth day of Navaratri, Dasara <br />likewise has overtones of a victory celebration, recalling victories <br />of the past and ensuring continued success in the future. It is <br />marked by the worship of the royal weapons, today symbolized by two <br />swords. In the past royal bows were also consecrated in this <br />ceremony. This rite which pays homage to the emblems of kingship is <br />rooted in an understanding of the relationship between the goddess <br />and sovereign power. In this rite, the royal weapons are understood <br />to be empowered by the goddess's presence.  <br /><br />_ivaji, the seventeenth century Marathi military leader who founded <br />the Tanjavur royal line, is said to have received his sword from the <br />goddess Bhavani, his line's tutelary deity. According to one <br />account, he kept the sword on the goddess's altar when not in use; <br />likewise the present raja thought the bow that represented his line <br />was kept in, and might still be found in the goddess temple. He <br />also noted that the Dasara celebration is still undertaken in  <br />Tanjavur, though the victory now invoked is conquest of evil rather <br />than military success. <br /><br />In addition to the consecration of royal weapons on the day of <br />Vijayadasami, the Maratha kings of Tanjavur demonstrated their <br />archery skills in a pavilion in front of the goddess temple. That <br />pavilion is called the seemollanghan chavadi, a name that translated <br />to mean the site representing the imperial power, or ability to <br />cross borders (seema=border; ullanghan=to cross; chavadi=building). <br /><br />There in an event that echoes the scene in the Mahabharata that I <br />have described above, the king would take aim and shoot at an <br />specified object to symbolize his prowess as well as his ability to <br />overcome any adversary, whether human or in the form of a malevolent <br />force. The demonstration was a statement of the king's sovereignty <br />and the extension of his protection over his domain. Likewise, <br />because of its auspiciousness, the day of Vijayadasami was when <br />princes were introduced to martial arts, including archery. The day <br />marked the beginning of their formal training under an eminent guru. <br /><br />Initiation Rite <br /><br />The present raja was initiated into archery at the age of 13, the <br />age of puberty, with a formal ceremony. In this initiation, he was <br />ritually bound both his teacher and to his bow, before he was <br />allowed to draw it. The rite was undertaken at the proper <br />astrological moment, the avittam nakshatra, an asterism identified <br />with Mahisa, a form of the goddess, that occurs during the Tamil <br />month of Avani. The initiation ceremony was done in accordance with <br />South Indian ritual procedure; the young prince was tied to his guru <br />with a yellow thread fastened around his wrist as a priest chanted <br />mantras that fortified the bond. The preceptor then handed the <br />prince the bow he was to use during his training, whereupon he was <br />instructed in the ritual process that followed. First he was to <br />place flowers on the bow and arrows--in effect to invoke and honour <br />the force of the goddess present in the weapon--and to recognize the <br />divine presence in that bow by consecrating it with kumkum, a red <br />powder used on temple images. After anointing the bow with kunkum, <br />the prince then worshipped that presence in the bow by drawing an <br />oil lamp before it. This action, known as arati, follows the ritual <br />practices undertaken throughout South India in both domestic and <br />temple worship. <br /><br />The effect of this act here is to consecrate the relationship <br />between the youth and the bow, by directing attention not just to <br />the weapon but to what is understood to be the divine force behind <br />it. When preceded by this initiation ritual and undertaken with the <br />proper attitude of respect and acknowledgement, the shooting of the <br />bow is thus not only a discipline, but also an act of veneration, <br />highly focussed and disciplined humility, as it were. A second and <br />equally important effect of the initiation ritual is to acknowledge <br />the tie between the student and the preceptor. In this rite, the <br />acolyte is bound to his preceptor through life and death. Further, <br />the survival of the tradition rests in this tie, for by instilling <br />the practice of archery in his students, the preceptor keeps it <br />alive; the cord that ties the student to the preceptor is the life-<br />line of the tradition. Overall, the initiation rite reminds one of <br />the complex of relationships--bow, student, teacher, training, <br />practice, discipline, tradition, and attitude--that make up <br />archery.  <br /><br />The raja's teacher was a member of the vastad community, a community <br />made up of "100 families" skilled in various martial arts. The <br />relationship between the vastad community and the royal line was <br />hereditary; the teacher who trained the raja also trained his <br />uncle. The hereditary relationship was marked with lands endowed by <br />the royal household to the vastad community and was annually renewed <br />in ceremonial presentations of gold, silver, jewels and other <br />ornaments. The raja said his father was very generous and that <br />these presentations, especially to his archery teacher, were lavish <br />affairs. When I asked the raja what has happened to members of the <br />vastad community now that this traditional relationship has been <br />abandoned, he wryly responded that they have gone off to find work <br />in the civil service. <br /><br />Every morning the archery instructors came to the palace. The raja <br />said he trained with his uncle's son. The palace also sponsored a <br />school of martial arts in which about ten to fifteen students <br />trained in archery, all of whom were in one way or another members <br />of the royal family. I asked him if women has also received <br />training in archery, and he said that in the past they had, but he <br />was not sure if they had in his time. In response to that question, <br />he showed me to a painting he had done several years ago of one of <br />his ancestors, Sujanbai Rani, a queen who ruled for one year (1736-<br />37). In this painting the raja had depicted Sujanbai Rani seated in <br />a palanquin holding a short golden recurve in her left hand. <br /><br />The raja also noted that when he took up the bow, his teacher <br />positioned him quite close to the target, perhaps six feet away. As <br />his shooting got more proficient, his teacher kept increasing his <br />distance from the target. When aiming, his concentration was fixed <br />on a coin placed on a board. The raja remembered his training: <br />establish his position, fix his aim on the coin, draw his string to <br />the upper side of his cheek while maintaining his concentration on <br />the target, and then release. One-pointed concentration was what he <br />emphasized when he spoke about his training, and that he was taught <br />to fix his aim before drawing the bow, even in shots that required <br />him to shoot from unusual positions. <br /><br />Technique <br /><br />The raja spoke about a thumb ring, but said that he had not yet used <br />one. He was taught to draw the bow by holding the arrow between the <br />thumb and fingers and pressing down on the arrow with the thumb <br />(figure 2). He the released the arrow by lifting up his thumb. I <br />suspect that had he continued training he would have eventually <br />graduated to a thumb ring. He shot off the right side of his left <br />hand, in contrast to Western-style archery which shoots off the <br />other side of the bow. The iron arrow heads were, in his words, <br />small and sharp. Finally, he indicated that archery exhibitions, <br />held in the royal gardens, were highly competitive. <br /><br />His Highness Thulajendra Raja P. Bhonsle Chatrapathy was the last of <br />his royal line to have received traditional training in archery. As <br />we spoke he drew upon the memory of his youth to recall what he knew <br />of archery. Though the time of which we spoke was some sixty years <br />earlier, there was something in the raja's fingertips which seemed <br />able to recall the presence of his bow. When I asked him to <br />demonstrate his release with a pencil, his movement was immediate <br />and automatic. Perhaps archery is a dying art in India; nonetheless <br />it is still very much alive in the memories of those who once <br />practiced it. <br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------<br /><br />Note: <br /><br />On the question of brass or bronze bows, the author's husband, Jaap <br />Koppedrayer of YUMI Archery, is collaborating with a metal worker in <br />Maryland to come up with a copper alloy that can sustain the <br />stresses and compression required in a working bow.</div>
