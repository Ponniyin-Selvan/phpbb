			<div class="content">V Venkatesh,<br /><br />Followers of Adi Sankara, to the much thought of belief, are not<br />Saivites but are called Smartha's. <br /><br />As you yourself mentioned, Sankara did sing Bajagovindam as well as<br />sang soundarya lahari. So he never preached or practiced Saivism but<br />veda dharma as a whole.<br /><br />Many,( including me till a year ago), think that Sankara's followers<br />are saivites. Its not so. Smartha's are the ones who go by smrithi's -<br />veda's and upanishads and they follow the veda dharma. Sanakara<br />reestablished the veda dharma and his followers are called smartha's<br />because they follow the smrithis. <br /><br />I came to know about this from Deivathi Kural by Kanchi paramacharya.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vinjamoor_venkatesh"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>What is the basis on which this claim is made. Is there any <br />  reference to, even an existence of such belief? And if this is <br />  accepted for argument sake, then the followers of Sankara, could not <br />  be Saivites and they have to be only Vaishnavites and we all <br />  probably know what is written in Gita. Well, I am not intending on a <br />  pan-religion or pan-sect debate here, but am only trying to list the <br />  reasons, why Sankara could not be BCE.<br />  <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Malathy<br />I have only heard about Atharva Veda/Koran similarities. My dad says <br />research books are available in India. <br /><br />The similarities between antiquarian religions/cultures is <br />fascinating. One wonders if <br />a) one was copied or influenced by others, or<br />b) if the thoughts happened independently.<br /><br />Of course, now, we know trade happened with Greece, Middle east, and <br />even Mayans attacked India. But it would be interesting to know how <br />cultural/religious practices dispersed and got assimilated. <br /><br />Some similarities, which I find fascinating, between Indian/Abrahamic <br />and other religions<br />1) Abraham and Sarah of the Old Testament (original spelling Abrahm <br />and Sarai) and our Brahma and Saraswathi<br />2) The Noah's Ark episode and our Matsya Avatar episode of floods<br />3) Noah (original spelling Nuh) and Manu (name similarity)<br />4) Early Romans had a religious symbol called Fascinus very similar <br />to our Siva Lingam (from great book "Roma" by Steven Saylor)<br />5) Greek God Zeus and our Shiva (name similarity. many common <br />stories.. like Zeus lived on Mt.Olympus and Siva of course on Kailash)<br />6) Greek God Dionysus and our Muruga (excerpt from research study on <br />the Katirgama cult below)<br /><br />**********************************<br />Like Skanda-Murukan, Dionysus "is neither child nor man but, eternal <br />adolescent, occupies a place somewhere between the two."21 As such, <br />both represent "the spirit of ludic energy and the power of <br />transformative play,"22 full of cunning, deception and strategies <br />that are at once diabolical and divine. In this they reveal their <br />common affinity to Hermes, the Greek god of cunning, theft and <br />eloquence whose caduceus or herald's magical wand finds its <br />counterpart in Skanda-Murukan's vel (Tamil: 'spear'), called his <br />JÃ±&#257;na Shakti or 'power of gnosis'.<br /><br />In Greek mythology, Dionysus is born from his father's thigh and <br />delivered to twelve nymphs or water-spirits, the Hyades, who become <br />the child-god's wet-nurses. Later, out of gratitude for their <br />service, they are exalted to the heavens where seven of them shine as <br />the constellation Pleiades. Likewise Skanda, born directly from <br />Shiva, descends to earth where he is found in a reedy marsh by six <br />water spirits, the Krittika maidens, who serve as the god's wet-<br />nurses and later are exalted to heaven as the Krittika constellation, <br />which is none other than the Pleiades; hence Skanda is also <br />Karttikeya, 'born of the Pleiades'. Just as Dionysus is <br />Purigenes, 'the one born of fire', so likewise is Skanda called <br />Agnibhu. Skanda is Sharadhajanma, 'born in a reedy marsh'; Dionysus <br />is Limnaios, 'of the marsh'. Dionysus is Dithyrambos, 'twice-born', <br />i.e. born first from fire and then from water. Likewise, Skanda is <br />born first from the fiery element of his father's third eye and then <br />born a second time in the watery element of Saravana, a reedy marsh. <br />Danielou draws attention to this astonishing convergence of thematic <br />elements and concludes that "Murugan, born in a reedy marsh and <br />nourished by nymphs, is elsewhere called Dionysus."23 So remarkably <br />parallel are the thematic elements surrounding the complex birth-<br />motif that it strains credibility to ascribe these similarities to <br />sheer coincidence. <br /><br />Source -http://www.kataragama.org/research/dionysus.htm<br />********************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Deepa, very well put!!

And about two Sankaras, even I <br />have <br />    heard that. But this view does not have a global acceptance. <br />Indeed <br />    it was Kaladi Sankara who revived the Sanathana Dharma after the <br />    onslaught of Jainisma and Buddhism in South India. It is the same <br />    Kaladi Sankara who stuck to Nirguna Brahmam and also had a Saguna <br />    Brahmam and said "Bhaja Govindam, Bhaja Govindam, Govindam Bhaja <br />    mooDa mathE". So if at all there was another Sankara who wrote <br />    Lalitha Sahasranamam etc, he must have been after this Kaladi <br />    Sankara. But I am sure that the Global view is that, it is the <br />same <br />    Kaladi Sankara, who wrote these slokas as well. <br />    <br />    ++++++++++++ Quote++++ +++++++++ +++++<br />    In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author of <br />      Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order to <br />    make <br />      the Vedic truths accessible to common man.<br />    +++++++++++Unquote+ +++++++++ +++++++<br />    <br />    What is the basis on which this claim is made. Is there any <br />    reference to, even an existence of such belief? And if this is <br />    accepted for argument sake, then the followers of Sankara, could <br />  not <br />    be Saivites and they have to be only Vaishnavites and we all <br />    probably know what is written in Gita. Well, I am not intending <br />on <br />  a <br />    pan-religion or pan-sect debate here, but am only trying to list <br />  the <br />    reasons, why Sankara could not be BCE.<br />    <br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I wanted to make a comment on some earlier discussion on Ahimsa. <br /><br />Ahimsa is, by no means, Buddha's original idea. It is one of the tenets <br />of living prescribed in the Upanishads (I think Chandogya). The 3 key <br />tenets of living are stated to be brahmacharyam (referring to self-<br />control, not living as a bachelor <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />), ahimsa and satyam.<br /><br />Secondly, isn't it true that Jainism focuses on Ahimsa even more than <br />Buddhism does or modern day Hinduism does? <br /><br />Of course, Buddha should be commended for popularizing/reiterating the <br />idea!</div>

			<div class="content">Satish,<br /><br />Thanks for the note. I did realise on reading it that I did not <br />convey what I intended clearly.<br /><br />As you said correctly, the followers of Sankara are termed as <br />Smarthas and not Saivites. But most of the later day, I repeat, <br />later day (this "later day" is atleast from the times of Appayya <br />Dikshitar - probably after 1400AD) started terming themselves as <br />Saivites, though they worship Vishnu also. Not like the Veera-<br />Vaishnavites. <br /><br />This terming is what I intended to convey. Sorry that, the way I <br />wrote had caused a confusion.<br /><br />Thanks for pointing out the error. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>V Venkatesh,<br />  <br />  Followers of Adi Sankara, to the much thought of belief, are not<br />  Saivites but are called Smartha&#39;s. <br />  <br />  As you yourself mentioned, Sankara did sing Bajagovindam as well as<br />  sang soundarya lahari.
