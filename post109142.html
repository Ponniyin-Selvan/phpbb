			<div class="content">Ravi, I agree with you that all versions are same conceptually. The storyline which is a manifestation of the concept is not that way, yes it is a vision but how do we know the vision was passed down or even interpreted correctly by followers? There are Ramayanas world over by the way, not just in India. Some of them are very offensive to indian sentimens such as Rama and Sita being siblings, or Sita Ravana&#39;s daughter and so on. People in those countries beieve them as dearly as we do. There is nothing absolute about any vision or version only our belif that is all.<br /><br />Ravi wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Valmiki&#39;s view is different from Kamban&#39;s view which is different <br />  from Alwars view. Analysis in each one&#39;s writings produce different <br />  concepts. <br />  Difference is not the same as concepts, concept is the same. <br />  The above situations are not vai vazhi or tampered story line. <br />  They are visions, which is something that MUST be considered. <br />  Beeshma talks from his vision the sahasranama, more importantly, the <br />  sahasranama has always been there, which puts a total spin of <br />  timelines. <br />  aaha...intha vaaram kuzappam varam nu nenaikaren.. . <br />  -- R <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com , "vinjamoor_venkates h" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />   Malathi, <br />   <br />   I am not putting down the possibilities of all those adders. What I <br />   am only saying is that "the probability of something getting added <br />  to <br />   the original is only as good as the probability of not getting <br />   tampered". <br />   <br />   Regards, <br />   Venkatesh <br />   --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com , Malathi Mahadevan  <br />   wrote: <br />     <br />     <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>, There are research books written extensively on origins and <br />   interpolations in both Ramayana and Mahabharat. IÂ  have not read <br />  any <br />   on Mahabharat but the Ramayana there is a very good book written by <br />   Paula Richman, Many Ramayanas - where she talks of significant gaps <br />   in the story that appear to be material dropped, and changes in <br />  style <br />   of writing that do not appear like the same author. She says a big <br />   gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile <br />  and <br />   why Sri Rama did not seek his brother&#39;s help instead of travelling <br />   south to Lanka alone. We have to know sanskrit prety well to look <br />   into changes in writing but it appears like very possible that the <br />   Ramayana after Sita&#39;s kidnapping may have been authored by someone <br />   else. <br />     Â  <br />     I agree with Satish&#39;s point that the Mahabharat appears very <br />  close <br />   knit to assume anything happened with the original. But &#39;vaai vazhi <br />   kadhai&#39; will have gaps all the time. Even two discourses on the <br />  same <br />   original are not the same. <br />     Â  <br />     Learning scripture by heart is fine, I agree. I learnt lot of <br />   things like that,Â all the suprabhats, sahasranaas and various <br />   slokas. Â Mahabharat is not a scripture to be learnt that way and <br />  from <br />   what I know it is even forbidden to read it at home. <br />     Â  <br />     Malathi <br />     --- On Sat, 8/23/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  <br />   wrote: <br />     <br />     From: vinjamoor_venkatesh  <br />     Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma <br />     To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com <br />     Date: Saturday, August 23, 2008, 5:10 AM <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     Sathish, <br />     <br />     Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it &#40;Kanchi <br />  Periyava&#39;s <br />     stance&#41; too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />     Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for <br />  by- <br />     hearting. <br />     <br />     I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars&#39; <br />     Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 <br />  days, <br />     just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day <br />  onwards, <br />     he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if <br />  we <br />     keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and <br />   even <br />     if we do so we will forget it soon. <br />     <br />     Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />     closed for the next 10-12 days. <br />     <br />     One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />     personally I would say that, they were more conservative and <br />  there <br />     would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new <br />  ideas. <br />     Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything <br />  new <br />     that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />     those days it would have been more. <br />     <br />     I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is <br />  very <br />     much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />     supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />     when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />     considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being. <br />     <br />     Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />     resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that <br />  would <br />     have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like <br />   you, <br />     that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But <br />  at <br />     the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened <br />  in <br />     the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by <br />   the <br />     Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking <br />   the <br />     bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />     supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from <br />  the "urai" <br />     pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself <br />  and <br />     yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />     statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many <br />  Tamizh <br />     scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />     idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy <br />  but <br />     atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no <br />   controversy <br />     and the project was itself in the godown. <br />     <br />     So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity & honesty of <br />  the <br />     Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />     back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the <br />  last <br />     millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during <br />   the <br />     times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />     presume it could not have happened. <br />     <br />     But all that we say &#40;either Your statement or Malathi&#39;s <br />  statement&#41; <br />     are only "possibilities" and we can&#39;t conclude until we have <br />  ample <br />     proofs. <br />     <br />     Regards, <br />     Venkatesh <br />     <br />     <br />     --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar <br />  Arunachalam" <br />      wrote: <br />       <br />       Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came <br />  to <br />       India and started documenting everything, the mode of education <br />  in <br />       India was by sishya parampara. Guru teaches the sishya, sishya <br />   has <br />     to <br />       memorize it, upside down,downside up and what not. In veda&#39;s we <br />   call <br />       it gana padam.....repeating everything in the reverse order. <br />  Even <br />       today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathul a ezhupi ketalum <br />     theriyanum. <br />       <br />       That was the quality of education we had and if that was the <br />  case, <br />       just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years <br />  where <br />     the <br />       human mind would have been more clear to remember things. So 3 <br />     degrees <br />       of narration and errors...I dont think that crept in....then we <br />     would <br />       have lost almost all the veda&#39;s and upanishads by now. <br />       <br />       Kanchi mahaperiyaval says that,we started forgeting things only <br />     after <br />       documenting them. If there is no documents, we will strive to <br />       remember, if we have a book, we will lazy thinking, ok i have <br />  the <br />       book, I can refer to it anytime, but we will never refer. Thats <br />   why <br />       the people who knew sanskrit and veda&#39;s have come down <br />   drastically <br />     in <br />       just a century, whereas our forefathers have preserved for eons <br />     together. <br />       <br />       Regards, <br />       Satish <br />       <br />       --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br />    <br />       wrote: <br />         <br />         Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was <br />  related <br />   by <br />       his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna&#39;s grandson Janamejaya in <br />  the <br />       great &#39;sarpa yagna&#39;.

			<div class="content">Ravi, I agree with you that all versions are same conceptually. The storyline which is a manifestation of the concept is not that way, yes it is a vision but how do we know the vision was passed down or even interpreted correctly by followers? There are Ramayanas world over by the way, not just in India. Some of them are very offensive to indian sentimens such as Rama and Sita being siblings, or Sita Ravana&#39;s daughter and so on. People in those countries beieve them as dearly as we do. There is nothing absolute about any vision or version only our belif that is all.<br /><br />Ravi wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Valmiki&#39;s view is different from Kamban&#39;s view which is different <br />  from Alwars view.

IÂ  have not read <br />  any <br />   on Mahabharat but the Ramayana there is a very good book written by <br />   Paula Richman, Many Ramayanas - where she talks of significant gaps <br />   in the story that appear to be material dropped, and changes in <br />  style <br />   of writing that do not appear like the same author. She says a big <br />   gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile <br />  and <br />   why Sri Rama did not seek his brother&#39;s help instead of travelling <br />   south to Lanka alone. We have to know sanskrit prety well to look <br />   into changes in writing but it appears like very possible that the <br />   Ramayana after Sita&#39;s kidnapping may have been authored by someone <br />   else. <br />     Â  <br />     I agree with Satish&#39;s point that the Mahabharat appears very <br />  close <br />   knit to assume anything happened with the original.

In fact I have heard it &#40;Kanchi <br />  Periyava&#39;s <br />     stance&#41; too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />     Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for <br />  by- <br />     hearting. <br />     <br />     I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars&#39; <br />     Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 <br />  days, <br />     just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day <br />  onwards, <br />     he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if <br />  we <br />     keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and <br />   even <br />     if we do so we will forget it soon. <br />     <br />     Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />     closed for the next 10-12 days. <br />     <br />     One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />     personally I would say that, they were more conservative and <br />  there <br />     would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new <br />  ideas. <br />     Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything <br />  new <br />     that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />     those days it would have been more. <br />     <br />     I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is <br />  very <br />     much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />     supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />     when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />     considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being. <br />     <br />     Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />     resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that <br />  would <br />     have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like <br />   you, <br />     that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But <br />  at <br />     the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened <br />  in <br />     the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by <br />   the <br />     Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking <br />   the <br />     bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />     supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from <br />  the "urai" <br />     pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself <br />  and <br />     yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />     statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many <br />  Tamizh <br />     scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />     idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy <br />  but <br />     atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no <br />   controversy <br />     and the project was itself in the godown. <br />     <br />     So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity & honesty of <br />  the <br />     Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />     back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the <br />  last <br />     millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during <br />   the <br />     times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />     presume it could not have happened. <br />     <br />     But all that we say &#40;either Your statement or Malathi&#39;s <br />  statement&#41; <br />     are only "possibilities" and we can&#39;t conclude until we have <br />  ample <br />     proofs. <br />     <br />     Regards, <br />     Venkatesh <br />     <br />     <br />     --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar <br />  Arunachalam" <br />      wrote: <br />       <br />       Thats where we differ from our ancestors.

In <br />those days it would have been more.<br /><br />I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is very <br />much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.<br /><br />Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that would <br />have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like you, <br />that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But at <br />the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened in <br />the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by the <br />Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking the <br />bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from the "urai" <br />pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself and <br />yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many Tamizh <br />scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy but <br />atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no controversy <br />and the project was itself in the godown.<br /><br />So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity & honesty of the <br />Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the last <br />millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during the <br />times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />presume it could not have happened. <br /><br />But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's statement) <br />are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have ample <br />proofs.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thats where we differ from our ancestors.

Gita says the same.<br />Thats what we mean by saying, atma is no qualities. <br /><br />Only because we dont think that we are free, we are bonded. Realizing<br />that we are free is self realization. It that state, the self cannot<br />do anything on its own. (people argue that if I am free I am licensed<br />to do whatever I like and so nothing is wrong, and does all the wrong.<br />This is explanantion for that arguement).<br /><br />And whatever I say, its not my gnana, its Swami Vivekananda's.... <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Deepak,<br /><br />You yourself said it is an interpretation. Interpretation are not<br />original and hence its duplicate. I am great fan of Kamba Ramayanam,<br />though I have not read it. Just a glimpse of it made me to start<br />loving tamil literature. So I have great regards for that.<br /><br />But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />(Actually I should say polish). Kambars character might look much<br />better that valmiki's, because valmiki gave things as is, where as<br />Kambar polished it to make it more suitable for tamil literature.<br /><br />Though we can appreciate it, if we want to know ramayana as is, then<br />valmiki is THE source <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>.<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> : <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tamilhindu.com">http://www.tamilhindu.com</a><!-- w --> has a series on Kamba Ramayanam, by<br />Mr.Harikrishnan, who is an authority in both Valmiki and Kamba<br />ramayanam.
