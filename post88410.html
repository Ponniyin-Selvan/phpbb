			<div class="content">ArunKrishnan,<br /><br />Kamba Ramayana too is a story.We only are comparing similarities<br />between both works,not dissimilarities.We compare the common themes<br />like characterization,description,script,handling of controversial<br />events etc.<br /><br />Kalki fares better than kamban in many aspects.As Drsridhar Rathnam<br />pointed out kalki created the whole story from his creative mind.His<br />works reached masses and made even ordinary man to enjoy<br />literature.I got interested in history only becasue i read Ponniyin<br />selvan.Kamban's work remains in an ivory tower till date.<br /><br />There are many people better than kamban in many aspects.Vyasa's<br />charaectirization beats every other work in the world(as far as I<br />know)The plots and twists he uses in mahabharatha with such huge<br />number of characters and with giving unique nature and role to each<br />of them and the coherence with which he moves the story is<br />unparalleled.<br /><br />The character of purichravas comes just in the last part.He has only<br />2 pages.But the importance purichravas gets in those two pages is<br />mindboggling.Similiar is bhagadathan character ,a 90 year old man<br />whose eyesight is blocked by wrinkles on his forehead.He ties up his<br />wrinkles with a silkthread and sits on his elephent supradeepam and<br />wreaks havoc in pandava army.<br /><br />In end arjuna cuts off his silkthread and bhagadatha loses his<br />eyesight.Then arjuna sends an arrow into the bowels of the<br />elephent.Vyasa then narrates what happened as follows.<br /><br />"The blind bagadatha not knowing what happened to his elephent<br />supradeepam forced it to fight with arjuna.But like how a wife wont<br />listen to the words of a husband who has lost the family<br />fortunes,supradeepam for the first time in life refused to listen to<br />the words of bagadatha"<br /><br />I will write more on this in some other time.<br /><br />I will write a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> on valmigi though.He wrote Ramayana through a<br />funny incident.He was a saint.One day he saw two lustful birds<br />copulating.He was very happy to see the two birds being happy.But<br />suddenly an arrow killed the male bird.Seeing this the female bird<br />also died.A hunter came to pick up the birds.Valmigi went mad in<br />rage.He immediatly said in sorrow to the hunter as follows<br /><br />"Oh the one equal to a tree,you killed a lustful creature.Till the<br />sun and moon exists you will be remembered for this"<br /><br />He did not curse the hunter though.He was very sad and came back<br />home.He then thought of the words he said at the hunter.He thought<br />on the first words "equal to a tree"(mara) He pronounced it<br />continuously mara mara mara ....and it became rama,rama.<br /><br />Then suddenly the verse he used to scold the hunter became the verse<br />to praise rama.Rama was the hunter.The lustful male bird was<br />ravana.The suffering female bird was mandothari.The hunter killed<br />the lustful bird and for that he will be remembered till the sun and<br />moon existed.<br /><br />The verse suddenly had a new meaning<br /><br />"Oh Rama,you killed the lustful creature.Till the sun and moon exist<br />you will be remembered for it"<br /><br />Thus was born the epic of ramayana.<br /><br />Ofcourse I am not saying that Ramayana was a fictional creation of<br />Valmigi.Legend has it that Valmigi wrote Ramayana only after god<br />appeared before him and said that he wanted valmigi to write<br />Ramayana and that is why this whole drama was played.<br /><br />we compare works across time only to pay our homages to the dead<br />authors and to be a guide to authors of future and to develop our<br />literary knowledge.Some do it for ego serving too,which I dont blame.<br />Without "vidhya garvam" a scholar isnt a scholar.But when it becomes<br />"padicha thimir" he will be knocked down to earth sooner or later.<br /><br />That is when literary meetings come in handy.They not only point out<br />what the faults are with the authors but also point out the fault in<br />the approach of the debaters.<br /><br />When nakkerar said that "Even women from devalokam have no natural<br />fragrance in their hair" he was knocked down by shivaperuman himself.<br />Becasue nakkerar couldnt have known the fragrance of the hair of<br />women in devalokam.He went to the extent of saying "Even the Uma<br />devi whom I worship doesnt have a natural fragrance in her hair"<br /><br />Here he was making an unsubstantiated claim.So he was knocked down<br />by shivaperuman himself.This is just a legend though.Valluvan also<br />wrote this as avaiadakkam.<br /><br />regards<br />sampath<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e

QUite interesting. My personal<br />feeling<br />    is that, people out here, Sri, Ganesan et al. are hard core Kalki<br />    fans that you are not able to digest any kind of critisism<br />against<br />    him. Just the feeling I got when I read your mails. We are not<br />    fighting here who is great, but just comparing and contrasting<br />    character sketch. I am not for or agains Kalki or Kambar. We<br />should<br />    appreaciate those immortals for their work. If I am in this<br />group for<br />    any reason, its because of Kalki and I think so is any other<br />member<br />    of this group. I think Sampath has his points valid and so is<br />Sri.<br />   <br />    I like to differ Sampath on the Hero worship thing. I am reading<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />    for the second time now and just completed the first part<br />yesterday.<br />    But in the first part, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> appears only in a couple of chapters.<br />His<br />    introduction is not that elaborative as that of Vandiyathevan.<br />    Actually the hero of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is Vanthiyathevan and not exactly <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />is<br />    the second hero. Thats my view. Maybe its Kalkis style and<br />greatness<br />    to show the great <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> in the eyes of Vandhiyathevan. But<br />througout,<br />    never Kalki worships any of the character, and again thats my<br />opinion.<br />   <br />    Re. the politics played by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>...its arasiyal. if he doesnt play<br />that<br />    he is not going to be a king. Its justified in arasiyal. Every<br />king<br />    has done that. Even during our trip to Manimangalam, Kamal,<br />Shankaran<br />    and I were talking about the killing of UC son by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> in the name<br />of<br />    punishment. We said that &#39;<acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> kaga UC payana <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> potu thallitan,<br />in the<br />    name of punishment. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> onnum periya sathyaseelan ella..&#39;. I feel<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />    as Great because he was humble enough to praise the efforts of<br />his<br />    subordinates. I was overwhelmed to learn about the Talicheri<br />kalvetu<br />    where he thanked and praised every labourer who worked for the<br />big<br />    temple. Thats his greatness.<br />   <br />    Coming to Kamban, i think there were serveral many critics in the<br />    past thousand years, who have torn apart kambans work and still<br />could<br />    not find fault and thats why he is kavichakravarthy still. I<br />have not<br />    read Kamba ramayanam,but hearing its glory itself I am<br />mesmerised.<br />   <br />    Actually I reply to mails only after reading all the mails. When<br />I<br />    read Sri&#39;s mail on the timezone concept i thought I will reply<br />    later...but when I read the paragraph at the start of this mail<br />from<br />    Sampath, I thought I will write, because he just spoke what I ws<br />    thinking of replying. I was thinking of the Uthyrayana and<br />    dhakshinayana concept. And I also feel that Meru should be North<br />pole<br />    and not Himalayan range. The directions of Meru are given in<br />    Thriuvilayadal puranam, bagavatham etc. I suppose. when I read, i<br />    felt it should be North Pole. So its very much possible to see<br />sun<br />    set in NP by Hanuman when he already saw it in Lanka. Why so far?<br />    When its dar is Chennai, its still possible to see light in<br />Gujrat..i<br />    think Sri will accept this. Because even from east to west as you<br />    say, the shadow of the sunset does not fall as a vertical line<br />from<br />    North to south..Its a diagonal line due to the axis of earth.<br />Hope<br />    you will agree with this. So taking all this into consideration,<br />we<br />    can assume that Kambar or during his time, these concepts were<br />known.<br />    Doesnt it make us feel great to know that 1000 years back our<br />    ancestors mastered the astronomy and geography and could use it<br />in<br />    their literature?<br />   <br />    Hope the thead brings in more knowledge to the group<br />members.Quite<br />    interesting really.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Sampath,<br /><br />You wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>ArunKrishnan,<br /> <br />  Kamba Ramayana too is a story.We only are comparing similarities<br />  between both works,not dissimilarities.We compare the common themes<br />  like characterization,description,script,handling of controversial<br />  events etc.</div></blockquote>This is where I have a disagreement with you. When you compare<br />soemthing, you usually compare ALL aspects. Some similarities are<br />present and some dissimilarities. You can then dig down deeper into<br />the similarities to see who did a better job in that particular<br />aspect. However, to take Kamban's poetry out of contention is doing<br />injustice to the great man.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Kalki fares better than kamban in many aspects.As Drsridhar Rathnam<br />  pointed out kalki created the whole story from his creative mind.</div></blockquote>Agreed here. Kalki did create a wonderful and brilliant plotline.<br /><br />His<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>works reached masses and made even ordinary man to enjoy<br />  literature.</div></blockquote>How are you so sure that Kamba Ramayanam didn't reach the ordinary man<br />in his times or soon afterwards? Although most ordinary people today<br />can't understand Kamban's language, that doesn't mean that in his day<br />and age, people couldn't either.<br /><br />I got interested in history only becasue i read Ponniyin<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>selvan.<br />I got interested in Tamizh history for the same reason.</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Kamban&#39;s work remains in an ivory tower till date.<br />Maybe in the current age it does. That doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t well</div></blockquote>received earlier.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>There are many people better than kamban in many aspects.Vyasa&#39;s<br />  charaectirization beats every other work in the world&#40;as far as I<br />  know&#41;The plots and twists he uses in mahabharatha with such huge<br />  number of characters and with giving unique nature and role to each<br />  of them and the coherence with which he moves the story is<br />  unparalleled.</div></blockquote>Of course, each individual writer has his/her own strengths and<br />weaknesses. Vyaasa's Mahabharatha might not have the poetic beauty of<br />Kamban's Ramayana.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The character of purichravas comes just in the last part.He has only<br />  2 pages.But the importance purichravas gets in those two pages is<br />  mindboggling.Similiar is bhagadathan character ,a 90 year old man<br />  whose eyesight is blocked by wrinkles on his forehead.He ties up his<br />  wrinkles with a silkthread and sits on his elephent supradeepam and<br />  wreaks havoc in pandava army.<br /> <br />  In end arjuna cuts off his silkthread and bhagadatha loses his<br />  eyesight.Then arjuna sends an arrow into the bowels of the<br />  elephent.Vyasa then narrates what happened as follows.<br /> <br />  "The blind bagadatha not knowing what happened to his elephent<br />  supradeepam forced it to fight with arjuna.But like how a wife wont<br />  listen to the words of a husband who has lost the family<br />  fortunes,supradeepam for the first time in life refused to listen to<br />  the words of bagadatha"<br /> <br />  I will write more on this in some other time.<br /> <br />  I will write a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> on valmigi though.He wrote Ramayana through a<br />  funny incident.He was a saint.One day he saw two lustful birds<br />  copulating.He was very happy to see the two birds being happy.But<br />  suddenly an arrow killed the male bird.Seeing this the female bird<br />  also died.A hunter came to pick up the birds.Valmigi went mad in<br />  rage.He immediatly said in sorrow to the hunter as follows<br /> <br />  "Oh the one equal to a tree,you killed a lustful creature.Till the<br />  sun and moon exists you will be remembered for this"<br /> <br />  He did not curse the hunter though.He was very sad and came back<br />  home.He then thought of the words he said at the hunter.He thought<br />  on the first words "equal to a tree"&#40;mara&#41; He pronounced it<br />  continuously mara mara mara ....and it became rama,rama.<br /> <br />  Then suddenly the verse he used to scold the hunter became the verse<br />  to praise rama.Rama was the hunter.The lustful male bird was<br />  ravana.The suffering female bird was mandothari.The hunter killed<br />  the lustful bird and for that he will be remembered till the sun and<br />  moon existed.<br /> <br />  The verse suddenly had a new meaning<br /> <br />  "Oh Rama,you killed the lustful creature.Till the sun and moon exist<br />  you will be remembered for it"<br /> <br />  Thus was born the epic of ramayana.<br /> <br />  Ofcourse I am not saying that Ramayana was a fictional creation of<br />  Valmigi.Legend has it that Valmigi wrote Ramayana only after god<br />  appeared before him and said that he wanted valmigi to write<br />  Ramayana and that is why this whole drama was played.<br /> <br />  we compare works across time only to pay our homages to the dead<br />  authors and to be a guide to authors of future and to develop our<br />  literary knowledge.Some do it for ego serving too,which I dont blame.<br />  Without "vidhya garvam" a scholar isnt a scholar.But when it becomes<br />  "padicha thimir" he will be knocked down to earth sooner or later.<br /> <br />  That is when literary meetings come in handy.They not only point out<br />  what the faults are with the authors but also point out the fault in<br />  the approach of the debaters.<br /> <br />  When nakkerar said that "Even women from devalokam have no natural<br />  fragrance in their hair" he was knocked down by shivaperuman himself.<br />  Becasue nakkerar couldnt have known the fragrance of the hair of<br />  women in devalokam.He went to the extent of saying "Even the Uma<br />  devi whom I worship doesnt have a natural fragrance in her hair"<br /> <br />  Here he was making an unsubstantiated claim.So he was knocked down<br />  by shivaperuman himself.This is just a legend though.Valluvan also<br />  wrote this as avaiadakkam.<br /> <br />  regards<br />  sampath</div></blockquote>Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Arun Krishnan<br />   wrote:<br />    Hi,<br />   <br />    I have been loathe to enter into the Kamban vs Kalki debate since I<br />    know almost next to nothing about Kamban&#39;s Ramayana &#40; a situation I<br />    shall definitely try to improve&#41; but aren&#39;t we comparing apples to<br />    oranges in a way? Kamban was a poet... Kalki was a storywriter.<br />    Perhaps Kalki was a better story writer than Kamban whereas Kamban<br />  was<br />    a far superior poet to Kalki? How about that folks?<br />   <br />    Cheers,<br />   <br />    Arun<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    On Mon, 29 Nov 2004 06:33:07 -0000, SatishKumar Arunachalam<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />     <br />       <br />        There is a slight confusion here.Many say that<br />  the<br />        meru said in epics isnt himalayas but northpole.Because in meru<br />        there is daylight for 6 months&#40;utharayanam&#41; and night for 6<br />  months<br />        &#40;dathchanayanam&#41;.And meru is always filled with ice and is the<br />        northern most corner of the world.Northpole suits this<br />  description<br />        better than himalayas.Im not sure of this.Just voiced my<br />  doubts.<br />     <br />      DearAll,<br />     <br />      Thats a great thread going on. QUite interesting. My personal<br />  feeling<br />      is that, people out here, Sri, Ganesan et al. are hard core Kalki<br />      fans that you are not able to digest any kind of critisism<br />  against<br />      him. Just the feeling I got when I read your mails. We are not<br />      fighting here who is great, but just comparing and contrasting<br />      character sketch. I am not for or agains Kalki or Kambar. We<br />  should<br />      appreaciate those immortals for their work. If I am in this<br />  group for<br />      any reason, its because of Kalki and I think so is any other<br />  member<br />      of this group. I think Sampath has his points valid and so is<br />  Sri.<br />     <br />      I like to differ Sampath on the Hero worship thing. I am reading<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />      for the second time now and just completed the first part<br />  yesterday.<br />      But in the first part, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> appears only in a couple of chapters.<br />  His<br />      introduction is not that elaborative as that of Vandiyathevan.<br />      Actually the hero of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is Vanthiyathevan and not exactly <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />  is<br />      the second hero. Thats my view. Maybe its Kalkis style and<br />  greatness<br />      to show the great <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> in the eyes of Vandhiyathevan. But<br />  througout,<br />      never Kalki worships any of the character, and again thats my<br />  opinion.<br />     <br />      Re. the politics played by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>...its arasiyal. if he doesnt play<br />  that<br />      he is not going to be a king. Its justified in arasiyal. Every<br />  king<br />      has done that. Even during our trip to Manimangalam, Kamal,<br />  Shankaran<br />      and I were talking about the killing of UC son by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> in the name<br />  of<br />      punishment. We said that &#39;<acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> kaga UC payana <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> potu thallitan,<br />  in the<br />      name of punishment. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> onnum periya sathyaseelan ella..&#39;. I feel<br />  <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />      as Great because he was humble enough to praise the efforts of<br />  his<br />      subordinates. I was overwhelmed to learn about the Talicheri<br />  kalvetu<br />      where he thanked and praised every labourer who worked for the<br />  big<br />      temple. Thats his greatness.<br />     <br />      Coming to Kamban, i think there were serveral many critics in the<br />      past thousand years, who have torn apart kambans work and still<br />  could<br />      not find fault and thats why he is kavichakravarthy still. I<br />  have not<br />      read Kamba ramayanam,but hearing its glory itself I am<br />  mesmerised.<br />     <br />      Actually I reply to mails only after reading all the mails. When<br />  I<br />      read Sri&#39;s mail on the timezone concept i thought I will reply<br />      later...but when I read the paragraph at the start of this mail<br />  from<br />      Sampath, I thought I will write, because he just spoke what I ws<br />      thinking of replying. I was thinking of the Uthyrayana and<br />      dhakshinayana concept. And I also feel that Meru should be North<br />  pole<br />      and not Himalayan range. The directions of Meru are given in<br />      Thriuvilayadal puranam, bagavatham etc. I suppose. when I read, i<br />      felt it should be North Pole. So its very much possible to see<br />  sun<br />      set in NP by Hanuman when he already saw it in Lanka. Why so far?<br />      When its dar is Chennai, its still possible to see light in<br />  Gujrat..i<br />      think Sri will accept this. Because even from east to west as you<br />      say, the shadow of the sunset does not fall as a vertical line<br />  from<br />      North to south..Its a diagonal line due to the axis of earth.<br />  Hope<br />      you will agree with this. So taking all this into consideration,<br />  we<br />      can assume that Kambar or during his time, these concepts were<br />  known.<br />      Doesnt it make us feel great to know that 1000 years back our<br />      ancestors mastered the astronomy and geography and could use it<br />  in<br />      their literature?<br />     <br />      Hope the thead brings in more knowledge to the group<br />  members.Quite<br />      interesting really.<br />     <br />      Regards,<br />      Satish<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Yahoo!
