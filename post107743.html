			<div class="content">Budha preached something that was never a proven concept till then, <br />Ahimsa.

			<div class="content">Ravi, my conclusion is that it does not matter if he was an avatar of the creative or protective force. It is even debatable if these forces are some distinct separate entities or aspects of the same entity.As you said for Gandhi, if the Buddha did not believe in the vedas,so what? What he taught otherwise far outweighed any other considerations. A belief is only somethingthat leads to an action, and blind belief in vedas can be equally disastrous as blind belief in anything else.<br />Â <br />I would very much like to answer your other questions but this is not a theological forum, and I do not wish to be stuck inÂ a stance with noone elseopening their mouths and then people get upset that the harmony of the forum is gone because of that.<br />Â <br />Stopping here for good I hope.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Sun, 7/6/08, Ravi  wrote: <br /><br />From: Ravi <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Dasavatharam<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Sunday, July 6, 2008, 10:35 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Budha preached something that was never a proven concept till then, <br />Ahimsa.

			<div class="content">There are thousands of avatars,technically even <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/RJC etc were <br />such.

			<div class="content">All,<br /><br />There is something more to this in Srimadh Bhagavatham than what I <br />wrote earlier. <br /><br />First let me take the issue of Gauthama Buddha Vs the Buddha <br />mentioned in Srimadh Bhagavatham. I did read some posts, like the <br />one from our Vijay, in which it is clearly indicated that the Buddha <br />was born in Magadha etc., definitely pointing towards Gauthama <br />Buddha. But incidentally, I referred to a very old reprinted edition <br />of Srimadh Bhagavatham by "The Geetha Press" in Gujarat and I could <br />not find any reference to Gauthama Buddha in that. So the question <br />seems to be hanging now in balance. And one more confusion as to <br />which is the Authentic Srimadh Bhagavatham. I have to say sorry that <br />I am not much qualified to infer on this. So I leave it with that <br />ambiguity for other learned members to talk about it.<br /><br />However the most interesting note that I read is that, it also <br />lists, not 21 but close to 28 avatars of Vishnu, while also <br />mentioning that "In Reality His (Vishnu's) Avatars are countless". <br />Some of the mentioned Avataras are as follows:-<br /><br />1. SanakAthi Munivar (The four sons of Brahma counted as 1 avatar)<br />2. Narada<br />3. Kapila<br />4. Dattatreya<br />5. Prishnigarbha (Son of Prishni - Sorry, no idea who is Prishni)<br />6. Rishabha (Proabably the first thIrthankar of the Jains)<br />7. Vyasa<br />8. Nara-Narayana (As in Badrinath)<br />9. Yagna (A temporary replacement of Indra)<br />10. King Prithu (after whom the earth was called as Prithvi)<br />11. Dhanvathari (the God of Medicines)<br />12. Mohini (During the pARkkaDal kaDaithal)<br />13. Matsya<br />14. Kurma<br />15. Varaha<br />16. Narasimha<br />17. Vamana<br />18. Parasurama<br />19. Rama<br />20. Balarama<br />21. Krishna<br />22. Buddha (Gauthama or Different)<br />23. Kalki <br />24. Hayagriva (the Horse headed God of "GnyAna")<br />25. Hamsa (The Swan)<br />26. The Avatar to project the elephant Gajendra from the Crocodile<br />27. The Avatar when He appeared in front of Dhruva to grant Moksha<br />28. Purusha <br /><br />Let us see to other references of these avatars. As Vishnu is <br />considered to be the protector amongst the trinity, it is said that <br />any King is supposed to be an incarnation of Vishnu, Logically. <br />Remember our AMV being spoken of in this manner, with Sangu Chakra <br />rEgais in his hand. That was no passing mention. <br /><br />Nammazhwar says in his Thiruvaimozhi....<br /><br />"thiruvuDai mannaraik kANil, thirumAlaik kaNDEnE enRum..."<br />(the mother of the thalavi, here Nammazhwar in peN bhAvam, says that <br />the thalavi has become so mad that whenever she sees any Righteous <br />(the adjective "thiruvuDai" is very apt here for this)king, she <br />thinks of him to be ThirumAl) <br /><br />Nammazhwar in his Thiruviruttham, expands this further as...<br /><br />".... en ninRa yOniyumAip piRandhAi, imayOrth thalaivaa....."<br /><br />meaning, He is born in numerous forms, as confirmed by the usage of <br />the word "en ninRa yOni".<br /><br />So much for the incarnations, let us see about the Buddha Avatar.<br /><br />Nammazhwar also makes a reference to Buddha Avatar in his <br />Thiruvaimozhi, though not explicitly.<br /><br />" kaLLa vEDathaik koNdu pOi, puRampukkavARum - kalandhu asurarai<br />uLLam bEdham seidhiTTU uyiruNda upAyangaLum....."<br /><br />Here he refers to Buddha Avatar, as I mentioned in my earlier post, <br />that He deceived the Asuras. "kaLLa vEDam" refers to the deceiving <br />form that He had taken. The word "kalandhu" refers to the fact that <br />He mixes with those Asuras and "uLLam bEdham seidhiTTu" refers to <br />the actual act of deception.<br /><br />This is probably the only reference to Buddha Avatar from <br />the "nAlAyira divya prabhandham" and this does not talk directly <br />about whether it is a different Buddha or Gauthama Buddha.<br /><br />So I stop with some definite ambiguity here.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Vijay<br />  <br />  now we have 2 entirely different propositions<br />  <br />  A&#41; there could be more than 10 avatars<br />  <br />  B&#41; there could be more than 1 buddha<br />  <br />  <br />  my question is when was the word dasavatharam mentioned first? any <br />  idea.<br />  <br />  we need to agree that buddha was not a 9th century phenomenon to <br />be <br />  juxtaposed in the other avathars. he was as much in the past as <br />  krishna to those in mallai or thanjchai .<br />  <br />  if we find an answer to the above i think we owe one to kamal for <br />  stirring it up.<br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar<br />  .S"  wrote: <br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> <br />  wrote: <br />     <br />      <br />        <br />        The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham.

			<div class="content">Smt Malathi,<br /><br />The straight answer could be, there are no definite timelines for <br />any Puranas, be it Vishnu Purana or Garuda Purana or any thing. Ask <br />any religiously inclined person, he will readily say that it was <br />there even before "kritha yuga". And as some one wrote very aptly, <br />Puranas are a little history with some mythical allegories embedded. <br />So there is no point in trying to ascertain the timelines of any <br />Puranas. <br /><br />This is my humble opinion<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Venkat, sorry I did not get/see your post and I thought Ravi was <br />replying to me.<br />  Â <br />  As far as my limited knowledge goes, the dasavataram along with <br />the remaining 11 are first mentioned in Garuda Purana, which is</div></blockquote>supposedly a 'bad purana' (only to be read in funerals).

What we wish to believe <br />sentimentally is besides the point,. Puranas are not history, they <br />are a mix of historical events with mythological allegories, we will <br />never be able to prove anyone is an 'avatar', or even a 'saint', we <br />accord those terms to people we think are a certain way and that <br />will always be a matter of dispute.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- On Sun, 7/6/08, Ravi  wrote: <br />  <br />  From: Ravi <br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Dasavatharam<br />  To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />  Date: Sunday, July 6, 2008, 7:01 PM<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  There are thousands of avatars,technically even <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/RJC etc were <br />  such.
