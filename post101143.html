			<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />Here Im telling my opinion about Mr.Arun Krishnan<br />thought.<br />Our ancient tamil people didnt see science as a<br />separate one. Science is a part of their day to day<br />life. So they didnt have separate division for science<br />in poetries as love and someother. They combined<br />science with all. When you see a set of poems, some<br />lines tell about some science factors.<br /><br />Ok. come to the point about Tharumi. The king didnt<br />give that question only to poets. He gave that to<br />everyone. The person conveyed the message as a poem.<br />As the answer was wrong, the other person opposed<br />that. Here they needed solied reason to prove that.<br />That is the one what we are calling as science now..<br /><br />So, they were also speaking about science with out<br />knowing that.<br /><br />Im writing this with my limited knowledge.

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by Shanbagam Karthikeyan  using id shen_karthik</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Hi all,<br /><br />This is a an interesting topic. As u guys said, I strongly agree that our ancestors did everything for a particular reason, all verified and proved. If they tell it as science then our people will not follow.. they combined everything with sprituality to make us get binded to nature...<br /><br />For example, Vinayagar loves arugampull so nowadays we can see Kattu Kattu of it sold and being wasted in the temple. But it was told for a good cause that.. if we have arugampull in any form it will act as a coolant to our body and reduces the heat.. hence our ancestors symbolised that by wearing arugampull over the big belly of vinayagar. But we leave the reason and cause but get hold of the action alone and get dragged into superstitious beliefs.<br /><br />Same goes well with Thulasi also. It has medicinal values and that is Science.<br />One citation with poem. Everybody would have heard about avvai's "aathisoodi". in that "sani neeraadu" comes. That again doesn't mean Saturday but in cold water we should take bath. Its good for health. so science has been injected thru peoms and poets.<br /><br />With my little knowledge I have contibuted to the topic. Correct me If wrong.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shanbagam Karthikeyan.<br /><br /><br />You Can Do IT !

			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />Ok so the main points in the argument for a tamil scientific temper seems to<br />be that a number of things which are nowadays being carried out in terms of<br />blind faith have some scientific basis behind it. I would rather suggest<br />that they have a logical basis behind it, not necessarily scientific.<br /><br />Perhaps I wasn't very clear in my original email. If you look at some of the<br />great civilizations, you see existence of the scientific temper. The greeks,<br />during the 6th -3rd century BC had great mathematicians and scientists,<br />culminating possibly in Archimedes and Aristotle. We Indians had our own<br />Susruta and Charaka and Aryabhatta and BHaskaracharya. However, in the<br />Indian context, any scientific treatise that I have heard of is in Sanskrit.<br />I know we all love our Tamizh heritage and want to wallow in its glory, but<br />we ought to take note of this complete absence of any documents in Tamizh<br />dealing with science or mathematics etc. Obviously we had the knowhow, else<br />something like the Thanjai PEriya kOvil wouldn't have been built. However,<br />why this lack of literature in Tamizh? Or was the lingua franca of science<br />in India, Sanskrit?

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />wisdom has been passed by word of mouth for C's even before writing <br />systems evolved - the easiest way to remember these were through <br />verses...the rhytymic chanting was a way to focus the mind and <br />render them to memory..rendering findings in poems was the best way <br />to capture it for posteriety. It wasnt akin to any da vinci code but <br />just an easy way to codify it and commit to memory.<br /><br />please also bear in mind that tons of tamil literature is thought to <br />have been lost .....wiki accounts...<br /><br />According to the Sangam legends first described in the Irayanaar <br />Agapporul and a commentary to it by Nakkirar (c. seventh/eighth <br />century CE).[2] there were three Sangams spanning thousands of <br />years. The first Sangam, whose seat was southern Madurai, later <br />submerged into the sea, lasted a total of 4440 years and 4449 poets, <br />which included some gods of the Hindu pantheon, took part in it. The <br />second Sangam was convened in Kapatapuram, which finds mention in <br />Valmiki Ramayana (Kishkinda Kanda 42:13). This Sangam lasted for <br />3700 years and had 3700 poets participating. This city also <br />submerged in sea. The third Sangam is described as believed to be <br />located in the current city of Madurai and lasted for 1850 years <br />under 49 kings<br /><br />check out below links <br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.histmedindia.org/surgery.htm">http://www.histmedindia.org/surgery.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It is believed that Visapala, a woman related to Raja Chola, <br />accompanied him into the battle field and lost a leg. The Vedic <br />surgeons Aswinis fitted her with an artificial leg. Also described <br />in Rig Veda asthe legend has it, that Raja Bhoja's (980 A.D.) skull <br />was trephined to relieve him of his severe headache and to remove <br />the malignant portion of the brain.

			<div class="content">Hi VJ,<br /><br />Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts written in the<br />southern part of India. My main query was to the utter lack of any<br />scientific text in tamizh. Why? Again, if your contention is that it was the<br />kings who decided, then sure, I can go with that...so Sanskrit was then<br />language of science in India. Or was it? Does anyone know for certain? Just<br />curious about it that's all...<br /><br />Also, sure the works from Sangams have been lost.. but I can't believe that<br />of all the works that have come down to us, ONLY the scientific works have<br />been lost in totality.. if there had been enough scientific treatises and<br />volumes, we would have had some idea or inclination about it... somewhere,<br />in some text..<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/4/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi,<br /> <br />  wisdom has been passed by word of mouth for C&#39;s even before writing<br />  systems evolved - the easiest way to remember these were through<br />  verses...the rhytymic chanting was a way to focus the mind and<br />  render them to memory..rendering findings in poems was the best way<br />  to capture it for posteriety.

We Indians had<br />    our own<br />      Susruta and Charaka and Aryabhatta and BHaskaracharya. However,<br />  in<br />    the<br />      Indian context, any scientific treatise that I have heard of is<br />  in<br />    Sanskrit.<br />      I know we all love our Tamizh heritage and want to wallow in its<br />    glory, but<br />      we ought to take note of this complete absence of any documents<br />  in<br />    Tamizh<br />      dealing with science or mathematics etc. Obviously we had the<br />    knowhow, else<br />      something like the Thanjai PEriya kOvil wouldn&#39;t have been<br />  built.<br />    However,<br />      why this lack of literature in Tamizh? Or was the lingua franca<br />  of<br />    science<br />      in India, Sanskrit? Like Latin was the de facto language for<br />    science in<br />      Europe?<br />     <br />      Any ideas?<br />     <br />      Cheers,<br />     <br />      Arun<br />     <br />      On 6/2/07, s.balasubramani  wrote:<br />       <br />       <br />        may be useful to some one<br />       <br />       <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommunication/ResearchJournals/">http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommun ... hJournals/</a><!-- m --><br />    rejou<br />        r/ijtk/ijtk2k5/ijtk_oct05.asp<br />       <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tnhealth.org/imtmp.htm">http://www.tnhealth.org/imtmp.htm</a><!-- m --><br />       <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommunication/ResearchJournals/">http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommun ... hJournals/</a><!-- m --><br />    rejou<br />        r/ijtk/ijtk0.asp<br />       <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ciks.org/aims.htm">http://www.ciks.org/aims.htm</a><!-- m --><br />       <br />       <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    ,<br />        "R.venketesh"<br />       <br />         wrote:<br />         <br />          Ni<br />         <br />          I guess science in india was on par with the world at every<br />    point<br />        of<br />          time.especially in architecture and astronomy.<br />          it was only with the industrial revolution that they forged<br />    ahead<br />          of us.<br />          also individual achievements were well recorded in the west<br />        whereas<br />          they were not here.<br />          for example da vinci &#40; 1500 ad ???&#41; invented the tank, the<br />        submarine,<br />          and the helicopter and a variety of machines even before<br />  some<br />    one<br />          invented the prime mover&#40; the motor}. so they were of no use<br />          davinci invented the parachute before some one invented the<br />    plane.<br />          but the important thing was he recorded it .<br />         <br />          venketesh<br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    ,<br />        "Arun<br />          Krishnan"  wrote:<br />           <br />            Dear All,<br />           <br />            I was watching the "Dharmi" episode of "Thiruvilayadal" the<br />        other<br />          day and<br />            something struck me.. Here was this supposedly great king<br />            and his whole council of intelligent men and the most<br />  serious<br />          question he<br />            could come up with was "Do women&#39;s hair smell good due to<br />    natural<br />            causes or due to the application of perfumes etc". Fine..<br />  even<br />          assuming this<br />            was a scientific query, where the devil was any sort of<br />            scientific enquiry/experimentation in there? All the<br />  scholars<br />        did<br />          was write<br />            poems about it? Where was the scientific temper?<br />           <br />            Let&#39;s assume that "this was just a movie". I have been<br />  looking<br />        at<br />          finding<br />            instances of scientific thought and temper in tamil<br />            literatures...From: my limited knowledge, I find that most<br />  of<br />    the<br />          literature<br />            is about love, or bhakti or spirituality or war. Are there<br />  any<br />            scientific treatises written in tamizh? If not why? Can we<br />    have<br />        a<br />          discussion<br />            about ancient tamizh science and technology?<br />            Why aren&#39;t there any tomes and books on it?<br />           <br />            If there were and I am mistaken, it would be great if<br />  someone<br />        could<br />          kindly<br />            enlighten us on this topic<br />           <br />            Cheers,<br />           <br />            Arun</div></blockquote></div>
