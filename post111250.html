Do you have H1, if yes can you<br />  please move closer to bay area ? I am 5ft 2 inches, I need a boy who is<br />  atleast 5&#39;10" if not shorter than kobe bryant ?

If i<br />  have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live as an<br />  american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - I might be<br />  broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen profiles of<br />  Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces in india,<br />  how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K<br /> <br />  I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is too<br />  difficult to identify, choose according to one&#39;s preferences. I hear similar<br />  stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the last<br />  decade &#40;or&#41; even before has become more a matter of convenience, than<br />  anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to<br />  understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance /<br />  sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day<br />  marriages have digressed far from the real truth.<br /> <br />  I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and I<br />  solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to<br />  me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself &#40;which<br />  others deemed to believe that love exists in them&#41; and the ones which all<br />  the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe<br />  most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern<br />  day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series which our<br />  BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.<br /> <br />  If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much more<br />  worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O&#39;shaughnessy and he told<br />  me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny.<br />  Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how<br />  come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a<br />  person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce<br />  immediately.<br /> <br />  Preferences of modern day youth &#40;both Men and Women&#41; have changed over the<br />  period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters the<br />  most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the place of<br />  origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day are<br />  people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new<br />  partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in<br />  the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.<br /> <br />  Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt rather<br />  its the attitude of people &#40;particularly Brahm Community&#41; and so called<br />  modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.<br /> <br />  Happy searching if you&#39;re in the hunt and if you&#39;re already married - all<br />  the best for your remaining part of your life.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --<br />  "Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />  difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />  -- Benjamin Franklin</div></blockquote><br /><br />--<br />Rahul Dhinakaran Creative Director Kalki Technologies<br />Mobile:0091-9345213804 <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kalkitechnologies.co.in">http://www.kalkitechnologies.co.in</a><!-- w --> "If you dont follow<br />through on your dreams, you might as well be born a vegetable".

G.O.K<br />    <br />     I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is too<br />     difficult to identify, choose according to one&#39;s preferences. I hear similar<br />     stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the last<br />     decade &#40;or&#41; even before has become more a matter of convenience, than<br />     anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to<br />     understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance /<br />     sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day<br />     marriages have digressed far from the real truth.<br />    <br />     I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and<br />     I solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to<br />     me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself &#40;which<br />     others deemed to believe that love exists in them&#41; and the ones which all<br />     the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe<br />     most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern<br />     day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series which our<br />     BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.<br />    <br />     If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much<br />     more worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O&#39;shaughnessy and he<br />     told me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny.<br />     Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how<br />     come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a<br />     person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce<br />     immediately.<br />    <br />     Preferences of modern day youth &#40;both Men and Women&#41; have changed over<br />     the period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters<br />     the most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the<br />     place of origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day<br />     are people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new<br />     partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in<br />     the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.<br />    <br />     Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt<br />     rather its the attitude of people &#40;particularly Brahm Community&#41; and so<br />     called modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.<br />    <br />     Happy searching if you&#39;re in the hunt and if you&#39;re already married -<br />     all the best for your remaining part of your life.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />     --<br />     "Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far<br />     more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting<br />     moment."<br />     -- Benjamin Franklin<br />    <br />    <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --<br />    Rahul Dhinakaran Creative Director Kalki Technologies<br />    Mobile:0091-9345213804 <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kalkitechnologies.co.in">http://www.kalkitechnologies.co.in</a><!-- w --> "If you dont follow<br />    through on your dreams, you might as well be born a vegetable".

The<br />reason he's still unmarried is because he takes the "jaadagam matching"<br />criteria too far. Your friends probably have such a criteria.<br />Ask them to give a honest reason on why they haven't found(thats the word,<br />shouldn't use the word "got") a match. Trust me, they would have rejected a<br />few for a particular reason which they are unable to compromise.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br />On 10/13/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Rahul,<br /> <br />  Its a one off case you are citing.<br /> <br />  If you want, I can match 1:10 in favor of men.<br /> <br />  I have 4 of friends who are in late 20s / Who are educated &#40;Post Graduates&#41;<br />  / Working in MNC / Earning handsome salary /Hailing from good family /<br />  Having decent bank balance and / Own a house in Madras.
