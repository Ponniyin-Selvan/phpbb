			<div class="content">Dear Sumeetha...<br /><br />Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> (I've<br />got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian who had an<br />affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that Nandini was Veerapandian's<br />daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha Karikalan<br />were one and the same...this is the first I've ever heard about the<br />'brother' theory.)<br /><br />I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply that she<br />was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went like this...<br /><br />1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would never fall in<br />love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded Veerapandian after<br />math of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew something of her parentage<br />by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case study.<br /><br />2) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to any length -<br />even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she wants.<br /><br />3) The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there is<br />clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar- Mandagini<br />and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are filled up<br />with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.<br /><br />4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked up both<br />Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in northern<br />Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan's message to Mahindan. And<br />when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle information<br />confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini?s twins.<br /><br />5) The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers<br />from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all the<br />trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, in "Nandiniyin<br />kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being Veera<br />Pandiyan?s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar kadhai<br />genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no inclination about<br />how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later some two<br />years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not the<br />lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.<br /><br />6) There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her<br />father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him for<br />abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she does<br />what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her lover,<br />so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - in this case<br />VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for leaving<br />her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she<br />conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death and swears<br />vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the section<br />that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi<br />character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.<br /><br />7) The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan?s lover is weak. Abathudavi's<br />claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died. This<br />could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny (the<br />Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of a way to<br />include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as the<br />patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the continuing<br />confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn?t know whether his<br />official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So he<br />makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.<br /><br />Well, what does everybody think?<br /><br />I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she<br />merely a victim of circumstance??? I've certain arguments there too...what<br />do you think, Sumi?<br /><br />Ciaow...<br />Pavithra.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br />Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:http://mobile.msn.com</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by Sumeetha vijayaraghavan  using id sv24in</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Hi Pavithra,<br /><br />The angle about Veerapandiyan being Nandini's brother was suggested by Ram<br />in one of his threads here. I think I have given the thread there. I guess<br />we can consider the possibility because if Veerapandiyan senior (the one who<br />met Karuthiruman and Mandakini) is the same one killed by Karikalan then we<br />can expect him to quite old. I guess it is difficult for think that she<br />would have fallen in love with him.<br /><br />But Nandini as a character has puzzled me a lot for various reasons -<br /><br />If she wanted to take revenge on the Cholas or especially Kundavai for their<br />treatment towards her the best revenge would be to marry Karikalan. Being<br />the elder brother's wife I am sure we can expect Kundavai to be subservient<br />to her in position and power. Yet she goes ahead and spoils it all by<br />telling karikalan that she had fallen in love with the wounded man.<br /><br />Did she do it just to scorn Karikalan? To show him - "You have all the power<br />in the world but I would prefer to marry a wounded and defeated king than<br />become your wife and a part of your arrogant family" Is this what she<br />thought?<br /><br />On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or brother.<br />Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately turned<br />Karikalan's anger on him. Why?<br /><br />"Electra's complex" - quite possible. It can also be a deep yearning to be a<br />part of something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a<br />heroine liberating, avenging and taking up responsibilities for an entire<br />kingdom.<br /><br />We should also not forget that her revenge is a double edged sword both on<br />Veerapandiyan and Karikalan. She turned Karikalan's anger on Veerapandiyan<br />because she felt that he had abandoned her mother and herself therefore he<br />got his head cut off and in the same time she took revenge on Karikalan for<br />allowing Sembiyanmadevi to send her away.<br /><br />In many ways her revenge on Veerapandiyan was milder because it was<br />Karikalan who had to bear the guilt of his actions which was a bigger<br />revenge.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>From: "Pavithra Srinivasan" <br /> Reply-To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br /> To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br /> Subject: [ponniyinselvan] The Nandini Conundrum...<br /> Date: Mon, 08 Jul 2002 21:52:53 +0530<br /> <br /> Dear Sumeetha...<br /> <br />  Well done.

He was a desperate man looking forward for the continuing<br /> confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn?t know whether<br /> his<br /> official heirs have survived &#40;like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets&#41;. So<br /> he<br /> makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.<br /> <br /> Well, what does everybody think?<br /> <br /> I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she<br /> merely a victim of circumstance??? I&#39;ve certain arguments there too...what<br /> do you think, Sumi?<br /> <br /> Ciaow...<br /> Pavithra.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> _________________________________________________________________<br /> Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:http://mobile.msn.com<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br /> <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Your use of Yahoo!

I think I have given the thread there. I guess<br /> we can consider the possibility because if Veerapandiyan senior &#40;the one<br /> who<br /> met Karuthiruman and Mandakini&#41; is the same one killed by Karikalan then we<br /> can expect him to quite old. I guess it is difficult for think that she<br /> would have fallen in love with him.<br /> <br /> But Nandini as a character has puzzled me a lot for various reasons -<br /> <br /> If she wanted to take revenge on the Cholas or especially Kundavai for<br /> their<br /> treatment towards her the best revenge would be to marry Karikalan. Being<br /> the elder brother&#39;s wife I am sure we can expect Kundavai to be subservient<br /> to her in position and power. Yet she goes ahead and spoils it all by<br /> telling karikalan that she had fallen in love with the wounded man.<br /> <br /> Did she do it just to scorn Karikalan? To show him - "You have all the<br /> power<br /> in the world but I would prefer to marry a wounded and defeated king than<br /> become your wife and a part of your arrogant family" Is this what she<br /> thought?<br /> <br /> On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or<br /> brother.<br /> Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately turned<br /> Karikalan&#39;s anger on him. Why?<br /> <br /> "Electra&#39;s complex" - quite possible. It can also be a deep yearning to be<br /> a<br /> part of something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a<br /> heroine liberating, avenging and taking up responsibilities for an entire<br /> kingdom.<br /> <br /> We should also not forget that her revenge is a double edged sword both on<br /> Veerapandiyan and Karikalan. She turned Karikalan&#39;s anger on Veerapandiyan<br /> because she felt that he had abandoned her mother and herself therefore he<br /> got his head cut off and in the same time she took revenge on Karikalan for<br /> allowing Sembiyanmadevi to send her away.<br /> <br /> In many ways her revenge on Veerapandiyan was milder because it was<br /> Karikalan who had to bear the guilt of his actions which was a bigger<br /> revenge.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   From: "Pavithra Srinivasan" <br />   Reply-To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />   To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />   Subject: [ponniyinselvan] The Nandini Conundrum...<br />   Date: Mon, 08 Jul 2002 21:52:53 +0530<br />   <br />   Dear Sumeetha...<br />   <br />    Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br /> &#40;I&#39;ve<br />   got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian who had<br />   an<br />   affaire with Mandakini -I&#39;m pretty sure that Nandini was Veerapandian&#39;s<br />   daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha Karikalan<br />   were one and the same...this is the first I&#39;ve ever heard about the<br />   &#39;brother&#39; theory.&#41;<br />   <br />    I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another<br />   <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />   fanatic. To my question about Nandini&#39;s origins, I got the reply that she<br />   was undoubtedly Vaarapandian&#39;s daughter. The reasoning went like this...<br />   <br />    1&#41; A person of Nandini&#39;s character and temperament would never fall<br />   in<br />   love with any one in a space of few days &#40;like a wounded Veerapandian<br /> after<br />   math of the Madurai por&#41;. Assuming that she knew something of her<br /> parentage<br />   by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case study.<br />   <br />   2&#41; A person of Nandini&#39;s character and temperament would go to any length<br /> -<br />   even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she wants.<br />   <br />   3&#41; The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there<br /> is<br />   clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar-<br />   Mandagini<br />   and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are filled<br /> up<br />   with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.<br />   <br />   4&#41; The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked up both<br />   Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in<br /> northern<br />   Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan&#39;s message to Mahindan.<br />   And<br />   when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle<br />   information<br />   confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini?s twins.<br />   <br />   5&#41; The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers<br />   from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all<br /> the<br />   trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, in "Nandiniyin<br />   kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being Veera<br />   Pandiyan?s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar kadhai<br />   genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no inclination<br />   about<br />   how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later some<br /> two<br />   years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not<br /> the<br />   lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.<br />   <br />   6&#41; There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her<br />   father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him<br />   for<br />   abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she<br /> does<br />   what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her<br /> lover,<br />   so as to direct Karikalan&#39;s kolai veri at that person - in this case<br />   VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for leaving<br />   her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she<br />   conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death and<br />   swears<br />   vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the<br /> section<br />   that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi<br />   character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.<br />   <br />   7&#41; The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan?s lover is weak.<br /> Abathudavi&#39;s<br />   claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died.<br /> This<br />   could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny &#40;the<br />   Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him&#41;. Thinking of a way<br /> to<br />   include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as the<br />   patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the continuing<br />   confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn?t know whether<br />   his<br />   official heirs have survived &#40;like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets&#41;. So<br />   he<br />   makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.<br />   <br />   Well, what does everybody think?<br />   <br />   I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she<br />   merely a victim of circumstance??? I&#39;ve certain arguments there<br /> too...what<br />   do you think, Sumi?<br />   <br />   Ciaow...<br />   Pavithra.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   _________________________________________________________________<br />   Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:http://mobile.msn.com<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br />   <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   Your use of Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Sumeetha...<br /><br />Sorry for the rather long gap- but I'm back anyway.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Your views gave me a good deal of food for thought- I found myself<br />doing a lot of thinking on what you've said.<br /><br />About what you've said about Nandhini exacting her revenge by marrying<br />Karikalan- I though of another view-point. Most of the times, the<br />daughter-in-law of a household weilds power only in name- she's generally<br />expected to keep back and do what her husband/mother-in-law tells her. The<br />real power, sometimes lies with the daughter of the house-in this case,<br />Kundhavai. Kundavai is not just the daughter of the Chola emperor, but she's<br />very popular with the masses too, and held in great esteem by her people.<br />Nandhini would be thrown into the shadow, while Kundhavai would still retain<br />her prominence. In essence, she may not have been able to get her revenge at<br />all. What do you think?<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or<br /> brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately<br /> turned Karikalan&#39;s anger on him. Why?</div></blockquote>Do you mean, why she made Karikalan kill Veerapandian?<br /><br />For one thing, she is of the opinion that Karikalan jilted her- in her heart<br />of hearts, she wanted him to win her back in spite of opposition. When he<br />didn't do it, she became furious. And what better way to take her revenge<br />than to make him kill her supposed lover Veerapandian (who was already<br />three-fourths dead anyway, and wouldn't have survived) in a fit of anger<br />(notice: she knows exactly how karikalan will react after he commits the<br />deed of killing her 'beloved' and knows that he will regret it because he<br />has hurt her terribly) then blame him forever?<br /><br />Personally, its my opinion that Nandhini didn't care much about the Pandya<br />Kingdom either. *She* had been hurt by the Cholas and been humiliated by<br />them, therefore she decided to hurt them as much as she could, notably<br />Karikalan.<br /><br />Well...what do you think?<br /><br />BTW, Imli, your photos are cool:-) (How are your studies going on?)<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing more from you guys,<br /><br />Pavithra.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br />Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:http://mobile.msn.com</div>
