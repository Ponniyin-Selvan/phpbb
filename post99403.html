			<div class="content">Ok i must confess to being the heretic here then. I still believe that our<br />Age is the most peaceful. Wars were a fact of life during those times... We<br />read all these romanticized novels.. and assume people were all healthy,<br />wealthy and wise! Come on... wars imply lots of problems for the common<br />folks. Gangs of marauding murderers bent on mayhem rape, loot. Now don't<br />tell me our glorious tamizh brethren didn't go in for that sort of a thing.<br />Human character hasn't changed all that much. Taking a look at some of the<br />rather unsavory characters infesting our political landscape, what makes one<br />believe that things were any different back then? Assuming that Raja Raja<br />Chozhan was a saint, that doesnt imply that the coterie around him would<br />have been any different from the political hangers on these days. Yes, there<br />would have been some great guys.. but there would also have been enough<br />lumpen elements. All in all, I do believe the current era we live in is the<br />most peaceful.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />AK<br /><br />On 12/3/06, Deepa Prakash  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>With reference to the medical system, the ancients<br />  were very adept with the priciples of Ayurveda and<br />  Ayurvedic nutrition.

			<div class="content">Hi Arun,<br />Your mail has an interesting line of thought. I would<br />however like to add a few of my own here. War and<br />Peace co-exisist in the world. We may be at peace in a<br />community, an area where we reside, at work but one<br />can never be too sure when something bad is going to<br />happen.<br /><br />Bad: Not really just natural calamities but problems<br />caused by man-kind. I have been travelling to Mysore<br />from Bangalore for 8 years now for my academic<br />endevors, some years ago we just hopped on to the<br />Shatabdi express and landed in Mysore. Now in either<br />station there are sniffer dogs and anxious cops trying<br />to look for possible bombs....this is far from being<br />peaceful. There are many instances, I am quoting just<br />one here.<br /><br />War: According to my Boss, war is one of the major<br />reasons for Technical advancement. Margerine in lieu<br />of butter, canned foods etc.<br /><br />The good exisists with the bad in this world. Looting<br />and the rest may not happen openly today. But it's not<br />that bad things have ceased to happen.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />As my Patti used to say, her 2 hours of sincere<br />prayer is to request God to minimize the sufferings<br />and to give us the strength to brave the trials and<br />tribulations of life.<br /><br />Sorry for having rambled on like this....but hey!! it<br />was FUN<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Deepa<br />--- Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Ok i must confess to being the heretic here then.

			<div class="content">Madan,<br /><br />The point is that there never was any long term security. Even the Chozhas<br />in their time lost wars. THe problem is that if a kingdom is always on the<br />go (war oriented), then the populace has to suffer from more taxes etc. Not<br />really the ideal place to be. I suspect that the reason some of the oldies<br />wax eloquent about the British rule is that, yes, after all the turmoil of<br />petty chieftains over the past centuries, there was a measure of relative<br />calm and safety for the common man.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 12/4/06, Deepa Prakash  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hee hee arms and armaments seemed to have been mega<br />  money makers from historic times:&#41;<br /> <br />  To the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Gp .... what your idea of "GLORY DAYS"<br /> <br />  Best Regards,<br />  Deeps<br /> <br />  --- Madan U Sreenivasan  wrote: <br /> <br />    Okay, to be fair, you are right.

			<div class="content">Exactly! Arun has the hit the nail! Peace makes a major difference in <br />lives. To me any era that's been really peaceful with a lot of free <br />time at the hands of the able bodied people and as a result, arts <br />flourished. Such is a time that can be called a time of peace. Those <br />are glorious days for any civilization or dynasty or whatever we call <br />it. <br /><br />As Madan rightly asked, given a choice of living between Afghanistan <br />and India, where would you want to be? Let's put two foreign places <br />which many of us may not know much. Between Afghanistan and China, <br />where would you want to be? We would still prefer China or for that <br />matter even the cold Siberian Russia to Afghanistan. The reason <br />PEACE! The present is any day peaceful times to live than the past. <br /><br />Also, the reason, I brought in Timeline was to show this contrast and <br />not diseases. Guess that sent another track of thought to MEDICINE. <br />With all due respect to then golden era of the Chozhas, I would <br />prefer to have it as my history and roots and read about the lovely <br />times in the present day living room where I enjoy reading my books <br />drinking a cup of tea and live very much in the present and do the <br />kind of discussions that I am doing right now. (he he he -- selfish <br />me)<br /><br />Madan do not lose heart. The kings you love are the kings we love <br />too. And that's the reason we are all here together in this group. If <br />I am to live during the 13th century and am given a choice of where I <br />want to live, I would want to live in any one or all the four of our <br />four nadus, the Thondai, Chozha, Pandiya or Chera. That was the best <br />place on earth to live then for the way and standard of lives of the <br />common man were. As Deepa said, its the life of the common man that <br />we do not have in detail. <br /><br />And yes Sridhar thank you, it was Andre Marek. I saw the movie for <br />first time this weekend. Only when I mentioned about the book it in <br />that mail, did I realize that I had missed seeing the movie after <br />reading the book. The movie was really good. (Successfully made my <br />husband watch itÂ—what an achievement) They had done justice to the <br />book. You do feel transported to the 100 years war that the book <br />talks about. Also, as you said, if you get a Lady Claire, then its <br />cool to live in that war mongering pestilence ridden past or may be <br />in my case, get a Vandhiyathevan or an Arul Mozhi Varmar, if not its <br />not worth it -- but even with that, I some how personally feel its <br />not worth when you have the choice of living in the present. <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>but can we live in that SILENCE.....Srividya<br />  will know what I am talking about</div></blockquote>--But then, Sridhar, what is the SILENCE that you were talking about? <br />I am not sure if I understand that right.. Are you talking about all <br />our discussions that we are having right now and the SILENCE or the <br />lack of it that may happen if we were to live in the past? Is that <br />what you mean as to if we can live with that? if that's the case, did <br />we not have a lot of Clubs (am unable to get the right tamil word for <br />it) those days? Oh yeah! AVAIGAL and KAVI ARANGUGAL where they had a <br />lot of literary discussions.-- Am I right? Do you not think that we <br />could have survived with those?<br /><br />Present is my choice any day with all these lovely books that can <br />transport me to the past in between those pages. That's my wholesome <br />choice. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Sorry guys too long a mail.

I suspect that the reason some of the <br />oldies<br />  wax eloquent about the British rule is that, yes, after all the <br />turmoil of<br />  petty chieftains over the past centuries, there was a measure of <br />relative<br />  calm and safety for the common man.<br />  <br />  Cheers,<br />  <br />  Arun<br />  <br />  On 12/4/06, Deepa Prakash  wrote:<br />   <br />    Hee hee arms and armaments seemed to have been mega<br />    money makers from historic times:&#41;<br />   <br />    To the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Gp .... what your idea of "GLORY DAYS"<br />   <br />    Best Regards,<br />    Deeps<br />   <br />    --- Madan U Sreenivasan  wrote:<br />   <br />      Okay, to be fair, you are right.
