			<div class="content">SHIPBUILDING FROM ANCIENT INDIA <br />  <br />Sanskrit and Pali literature has innumerable references to the <br />maritime activity of Indians in ancient times. There is also one <br />treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru which has been compiled <br />by a person called Bhoja Narapati. <br /><br />(The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated and published by <br />Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit Manu scripts.   <br />  <br />This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on the technique of <br />shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the various types of <br />ships, their sizes, the materials from which they were built. The <br />Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the available <br />information <br />  <br />  <br />The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information and date to prove <br />that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a good knowledge of <br />the materials which were used in building ships. Apart from <br />describing the qualities of the different types of wood and their <br />suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru also gives an <br />elaborate classification of ships based on their size. <br />  <br />  <br />The primary division is into 2 classes viz. Samanya (ordinary) and <br />Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea voyages. Ships that <br />undertook sea voyages were classified into, Dirgha type of ships <br />which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata type of ships which <br />had a higher hull. <br />  <br />  <br />The treatise also gives elaborate directions for decorating and <br />furnishing the ships with a view to making them comfortable for <br />passengers. Also mentioned are details about the internal seating and <br />accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three classes of ships are <br />distinguished according to their length and the position of cabins. <br />The ships having cabins extending from one end of the deck to the <br />other are called Sarvamandira vessels. <br />  <br />These ships are recommended for the transport of royal treasure and <br />horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira vessels which have cabins <br />only in the middle part of their deck. these vessels are recommended <br />for pleasure trips. And finally there is a category of Agramandira <br />vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare. <br />  <br />  <br />MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S COMPASS <br />  <br />Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many parts of a ship. The <br />ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which literally <br />means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was called Vata Vastra a <br />which means 'wind-cloth'. <br />  <br />The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded area'. The rudder was <br />called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was also known as <br />Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so called because it used <br />to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in exhaust fans. The <br />ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom of a ship'. The <br />mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a pole. <br />  <br />Even a sextant was used for navigation and was called Vruttashanga-<br />Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a contrived mariner's <br />compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to 2000 years ago. <br />This claim is not being made in an overzealous nationalistic spirit. <br />This has in fact been the suggestion of an European expert, Mr. J.L. <br />Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Ship <br />builders in England at around the beginning of the present century. <br />This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />Part ii., Appendix A. <br />  <br />"The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet, in <br />fixing the North and East, in laying foundations, and other religious <br />ceremonies. <br /><br />The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a vessel of oil <br />and pointed to the North. The fact of this older Hindu compass seems <br />placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha Yantra, or fish <br />machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the mariner's compass". <br />  <br />It is significant to note that these are the words of a foreign Naval <br />Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite possible that the <br />Maccha Yantra (fish machine) was transmitted to the west by the Arabs <br />to give us the mariner's compass of today. <br /><br />ref; website ; <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.maritimereplicas.com/index.htm">http://www.maritimereplicas.com/index.htm</a><!-- m --> <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://india.coolatlanta.com/GreatPages/sudheer/book.html">http://india.coolatlanta.com/GreatPages ... /book.html</a><!-- m --></div>

There is also one<br />treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru which has been compiled<br />by a person called Bhoja Narapati.<br /><br />(The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated and published by<br />Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit Manu scripts.<br /><br />This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on the technique of<br />shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the various types of<br />ships, their sizes, the materials from which they were built. The<br />Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the available<br />information<br /><br /><br />The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information and date to prove<br />that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a good knowledge of<br />the materials which were used in building ships. Apart from<br />describing the qualities of the different types of wood and their<br />suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru also gives an<br />elaborate classification of ships based on their size.<br /><br /><br />The primary division is into 2 classes viz. Samanya (ordinary) and<br />Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea voyages. Ships that<br />undertook sea voyages were classified into, Dirgha type of ships<br />which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata type of ships which<br />had a higher hull.<br /><br /><br />The treatise also gives elaborate directions for decorating and<br />furnishing the ships with a view to making them comfortable for<br />passengers. Also mentioned are details about the internal seating and<br />accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three classes of ships are<br />distinguished according to their length and the position of cabins.<br />The ships having cabins extending from one end of the deck to the<br />other are called Sarvamandira vessels.<br /><br />These ships are recommended for the transport of royal treasure and<br />horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira vessels which have cabins<br />only in the middle part of their deck. these vessels are recommended<br />for pleasure trips. And finally there is a category of Agramandira<br />vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare.<br /><br /><br />MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S COMPASS<br /><br />Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many parts of a ship. The<br />ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which literally<br />means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was called Vata Vastra a<br />which means 'wind-cloth'.<br /><br />The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded area'. The rudder was<br />called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was also known as<br />Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so called because it used<br />to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in exhaust fans. The<br />ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom of a ship'. The<br />mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a pole.<br /><br />Even a sextant was used for navigation and was called Vruttashanga-<br />Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a contrived mariner's<br />compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to 2000 years ago.<br />This claim is not being made in an overzealous nationalistic spirit.<br />This has in fact been the suggestion of an European expert, Mr. J.L.<br />Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Ship<br />builders in England at around the beginning of the present century.<br />This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiii.,<br />Part ii., Appendix A.<br /><br />"The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet, in<br />fixing the North and East, in laying foundations, and other religious<br />ceremonies.<br /><br />The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a vessel of oil<br />and pointed to the North. The fact of this older Hindu compass seems<br />placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha Yantra, or fish<br />machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the mariner's compass".<br /><br />It is significant to note that these are the words of a foreign Naval<br />Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite possible that the<br />Maccha Yantra (fish machine) was transmitted to the west by the Arabs<br />to give us the mariner's compass of today.<br /><br />ref; website ;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.maritimereplicas.com/index.htm">http://www.maritimereplicas.com/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://india.coolatlanta.com/GreatPages/sudheer/book.html">http://india.coolatlanta.com/GreatPages ... /book.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Send instant messages to your online <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com">friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Find out what India is talking about on - Yahoo!

There<br />    is also one <br />    treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru which<br />    has been compiled <br />    by a person called Bhoja Narapati. <br />    <br />    &#40;The Yukti Kalpa Taru &#40;YKT&#41; had been translated and<br />    published by <br />    Prof. Aufrecht in his &#39;Catalogue of Sanskrit Manu<br />    scripts. <br />    <br />    This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on the<br />    technique of <br />    shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the<br />    various types of <br />    ships, their sizes, the materials from which they<br />    were built. The <br />    Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the<br />    available <br />    information <br />    <br />    <br />    The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information<br />    and date to prove <br />    that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a<br />    good knowledge of <br />    the materials which were used in building ships.<br />    Apart from <br />    describing the qualities of the different types of<br />    wood and their <br />    suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru<br />    also gives an <br />    elaborate classification of ships based on their<br />    size. <br />    <br />    <br />    The primary division is into 2 classes viz. Samanya<br />    &#40;ordinary&#41; and <br />    Vishesha &#40;Special&#41;. The ordinary type for sea<br />    voyages. Ships that <br />    undertook sea voyages were classified into, Dirgha<br />    type of ships <br />    which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata type<br />    of ships which <br />    had a higher hull. <br />    <br />    <br />    The treatise also gives elaborate directions for<br />    decorating and <br />    furnishing the ships with a view to making them<br />    comfortable for <br />    passengers. Also mentioned are details about the<br />    internal seating and <br />    accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three<br />    classes of ships are <br />    distinguished according to their length and the<br />    position of cabins. <br />    The ships having cabins extending from one end of<br />    the deck to the <br />    other are called Sarvamandira vessels. <br />    <br />    These ships are recommended for the transport of<br />    royal treasure and <br />    horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira vessels<br />    which have cabins <br />    only in the middle part of their deck. these vessels<br />    are recommended <br />    for pleasure trips. And finally there is a category<br />    of Agramandira <br />    vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare. <br />    <br />    <br />    MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER&#39;S COMPASS<br />    <br />    <br />    Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many<br />    parts of a ship. The <br />    ship&#39;s anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which<br />    literally <br />    means &#39;A Nail to tie up a ship&#39; . The sail was<br />    called Vata Vastra a <br />    which means &#39;wind-cloth&#39;. <br />    <br />    The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an&#39;expanded<br />    area&#39;. The rudder was <br />    called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was<br />    also known as <br />    Karna which literally means a &#39;ear&#39; and was so<br />    called because it used <br />    to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in<br />    exhaust fans. The <br />    ship&#39;s keel was called Nava-Tala which means &#39;bottom<br />    of a ship&#39;. The <br />    mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a<br />    pole. <br />    <br />    Even a sextant was used for navigation and was<br />    called Vruttashanga-<br />    Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a<br />    contrived mariner&#39;s <br />    compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to<br />    2000 years ago. <br />    This claim is not being made in an overzealous<br />    nationalistic spirit. <br />    This has in fact been the suggestion of an European<br />    expert, Mr. J.L. <br />    Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval<br />    Architects and Ship <br />    builders in England at around the beginning of the<br />    present century. <br />    This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay<br />    Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />    Part ii., Appendix A. <br />    <br />    "The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used<br />    the magnet, in <br />    fixing the North and East, in laying foundations,<br />    and other religious <br />    ceremonies. <br />    <br />    The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a<br />    vessel of oil <br />    and pointed to the North. The fact of this older<br />    Hindu compass seems <br />    placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha<br />    Yantra, or fish <br />    machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the<br />    mariner&#39;s compass". <br />    <br />    It is significant to note that these are the words<br />    of a foreign Naval <br />    Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite<br />    possible that the <br />    Maccha Yantra &#40;fish machine&#41; was transmitted to the<br />    west by the Arabs <br />    to give us the mariner&#39;s compass of today. <br />    <br />    ref; website ; <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.maritimereplicas.com/index.htm">http://www.maritimereplicas.com/index.htm</a><!-- m --> <br />   <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://india.coolatlanta.com/GreatPages/sudheer/book.html">http://india.coolatlanta.com/GreatPages ... /book.html</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />  === message truncated ===<br />  <br />  <br />  Warm Regards,<br />  <br />  Deepa Prakash<br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />______________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Want to start your own business?<br />  Learn how on Yahoo!

It sets forth minute details about<br />  the<br />      various types of <br />      ships, their sizes, the materials from which<br />  they<br />      were built. The <br />      Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all<br />  the<br />      available <br />      information <br />      <br />      <br />      The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient<br />  information<br />      and date to prove <br />      that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a<br />      good knowledge of <br />      the materials which were used in building ships.<br />      Apart from <br />      describing the qualities of the different types<br />  of<br />      wood and their <br />      suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa<br />  Taru<br />      also gives an <br />      elaborate classification of ships based on their<br />      size. <br />      <br />      <br />      The primary division is into 2 classes viz.<br />  Samanya<br />      &#40;ordinary&#41; and <br />      Vishesha &#40;Special&#41;. The ordinary type for sea<br />      voyages. Ships that <br />      undertook sea voyages were classified into,<br />  Dirgha<br />      type of ships <br />      which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata<br />  type<br />      of ships which <br />      had a higher hull. <br />      <br />      <br />      The treatise also gives elaborate directions for<br />      decorating and <br />      furnishing the ships with a view to making them<br />      comfortable for <br />      passengers. Also mentioned are details about the<br />      internal seating and <br />      accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three<br />      classes of ships are <br />      distinguished according to their length and the<br />      position of cabins. <br />      The ships having cabins extending from one end<br />  of<br />      the deck to the <br />      other are called Sarvamandira vessels. <br />      <br />      These ships are recommended for the transport of<br />      royal treasure and <br />      horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira<br />  vessels<br />      which have cabins <br />      only in the middle part of their deck. these<br />  vessels<br />      are recommended <br />      for pleasure trips. And finally there is a<br />  category<br />      of Agramandira <br />      vessels, these ships were used mainly in<br />  warfare. <br />      <br />      <br />      MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER&#39;S<br />  COMPASS<br />      <br />      <br />      Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many<br />      parts of a ship.
