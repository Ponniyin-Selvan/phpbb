			<div class="content">Yes, well said Venkatesh. Upper middle class urbanites<br />are somehow often confused between being<br />positive/seeing what is good in culture and having<br />empathy and understanding for what is not so good at<br />the same time.<br /><br />Treatment of widows has improved only recently, that<br />too more because of more women working. The general<br />attitude especially in orthodox hindu families still<br />has a long way to go. My great grandmother was a<br />'mottai patti' as they used to call, shaved and<br />confined to dark rooms, not allowed to come in front<br />of men or priests or in functions. Her daughter was<br />marginally better, no shaving, but still always<br />thought of as 'thaali aruthaval' and never allowed<br />dignity and presence in functions. Her daughter, my<br />aunt, also widowed, worked as a teacher and was<br />widowed just 15 years ago. She has much better status,<br />is a working woman and is able to participate in<br />functions and like anyone else. That is a sign of<br />improving times, atleast for those of us who make a<br />middle class living. The people like those shown in<br />'water' are poor and below poverty level. For them<br />things are very similar. The numbers of women begging<br />on the streets of Varanasi is phenomenal. Female<br />infanticide is a very common and unresolved issue in<br />villages in Tamil Nadu.<br /><br />Talking of all this does not make us in any way<br />pessmistic or 'blowing out of proportion', it only<br />increases awareness to do what we can do. Thinking any<br />problem that is not directly concerned with me or my<br />direct circle of people does not exist is just<br />indifference.<br /><br />--- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I also know another lady who when her husband passed<br />  away opted to<br />  wear white , though her children were against it.<br />  Things are<br />  certainly blown out of proportion in movies to make<br />  matters "<br />  Cinematic"<br /> <br /> <br />  no. I differ.<br /> <br />  in urbanised populations perhaps yes. but down in<br />  the villages , even<br />  in well to do or cultured families the bangle<br />  breaking ceremony etc<br />  happens.<br /> <br />  customs related to death are the slowest to change<br />  in any community.<br />  even the path taken to a graveyard seldom changes.<br />  this conflict we see more often in the expansion of<br />  madras in the ecr<br />  and omr. people dont want to take an alternate path<br />  and almost every<br />  community has 2 graveyards for hindus alone.</div></blockquote><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Satish, am not sure what statistics you are comparing,<br />for one thing it is not related. Having a grand parent<br />who tells stories does not mean she was treated well,<br />my great grandmother was a mottai patti who told<br />stories till the day she died. We loved her dearly but<br />we were children. She was widowed at 16, and never<br />wore anything other than widow's garb and sandal on<br />her head. Her head was shaved off her long locks.<br /><br />There is not much you can infer from statistics , be<br />it true or false.

			<div class="content">Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion. Savitri<br />is cast out by her husband and his family when she is<br />pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On her<br />own she finds a distant relative, becomes a graduate<br />and a very rich woman in middle age.<br /><br />When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes back<br />looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks the<br />'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the house.<br />She later joins the freedom struggle.<br /><br />My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy the<br />story ending created, women casting out husbands or<br />even speaking up for themselves was unknown in those<br />days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that way.<br /><br /><br />--- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In Kalvanin Kathali, the heroin Kalyani is married<br />  to an old man<br />    becomes a widow in a young age.<br /> <br /> <br />  this was another common thread in many of kalki&#39;s<br />  books<br /> <br />  a young woman marrying an elder man. starting from<br />  sembiyan madevi<br />  who recalls her story, nandini, kalyani......<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  But she inherits all the property<br />  and<br />    manages them efficiently. one of her husbands<br />  distant relative, who<br />    wants to acquire all her wealth fails time and<br />  again, because she<br />  was<br />    so powerful.<br />   <br />    This story, I think was written in<br />  pre-independence era. Even if<br />  its<br />    Kalki&#39;s imagination, writers always take<br />  inspiration from the<br />    prevailing society.<br />   <br />    I have not seen the movie &#39;water&#39;. But I feel, all<br />  those people who<br />    criticize, not just the state of women &#40;widow&#41;,<br />  but anything in<br />  indian<br />    culture, especially hindu&#39;s practice, try to find<br />  a dot in a huge<br />    madil suvar and blow it out of proportion.<br />   <br />    A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm movie<br />  on the big<br />  screen,<br />    and people who want to find fault will definitely<br />  discover a small<br />    black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.<br />   <br />    There are humpteen good things in our society and<br />  no one talks<br />  about<br />    it.

			<div class="content">Yes Venkatesh, it is true. But if you look at the type<br />of lives these women had, it is hard to hold anything<br />against them. Widowed at 14/16, some married to men<br />more than double their age, some carrying children<br />when they are children themselves...it is not<br />surprising they carried bitterness or anger and could<br />not see other people live.<br /><br />That is not just about widowhood, it is a fact of<br />life, most people who are treated badly will usually<br />treat others badly as they don't know how else to make<br />up for what they lost. Instead of saying that fault<br />lies with men or women we have to see how to avoid mis<br />treatment of people in the first place. Not showing<br />too much regard for Sati type of rituals itself is a<br />good first step in that direction.<br /><br /><br /><br />--- "Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>- 50% of the population would not have had their<br />  mothers living<br />  for long<br />    - more than half the population would have been<br />  deprived of the<br />    relation called &#39;patti&#39; &#40;or rather any elderly<br />  female relative,<br />  like<br />    athai, periyamma etc&#41;<br />    - Almost 75% of the indian population were sadist<br />  because they were<br />    cruel to widows<br />    - 50% of grandchildren would have missed the bed<br />  time stories from<br />    Grandmothers<br />   <br />    we can go on....Most of us will be attached to<br />  patti&#39;s rather than<br />    thatha&#39;s.

			<div class="content">Reading Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of R.K.Narayan's Dark Room<br />which was written in 1930s.

Many insults later, she leaves home and<br />survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at a koil. She comes<br />back because she realises that she can't do this forever and for her<br />children, but her one act of defiance has changed things at their<br />home.

			<div class="content">Suneeta, Thyaga Bhoomi was written in 1948, soon after<br />the freedom struggle. If I remember right Savitri does<br />not leave voluntarily, she is asked to get out by her<br />mother in law who constantly demands dowry and husband<br />who has an affair with his British secretary Susie.<br />She has no children other than one child she is<br />pregnant with at that time.<br /><br />She eats in temple and then travels on someone's<br />kindness from Calcuta to her father's village Saavadi<br />Kuppam, her father has sold all he had and gone to do<br />service in Congress. Her daughter Chaaru is born in a<br />government hospital after she passes out on the street<br />and someone takes her there.<br /><br />So the story goes on, her transformation from a timid<br />village girl to a modern rich educated Uma Rani.
