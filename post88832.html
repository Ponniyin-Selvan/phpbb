			<div class="content">Dear Friends,<br /><br />Not only the descendants....<br /><br />Can anyone tell me where exactly the palace of Chola kingdom existed?<br />because what we are seeing in thanjavur is not the palace of chola kingdom<br />but it was built by the sarfogis (I think). Some places we can see some<br />walls like fort walls which are made up of brick but I think this also not<br />built by cholas because during their period they would have built the fort<br />and palace using stone rather than using brick. The stone is stronger than<br />brick!!<br /><br />Please correct me If I am wrong....<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R<br /><br />On Jan 27, 2008 6:13 PM, R.venketesh  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi nithya<br />  hope you read these 2 articles on the nizam.<br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,2222979,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story ... 79,00.html</a><!-- m --><br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1229209,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/artic ... 09,00.html</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  nizam&#39;s problems are with his own kin. legal troubles mainly.<br />  but was paid a good compensation for his jewels. 20 milion pounds and<br />  another 20 milion to his litigants.<br /> <br />  people out there in the palace in tanjoreâ€¦..but I would wan to know<br />  those,, who might possess the DNA of those mighty rulers of 10th<br />  centuryâ€¦<br /> <br />  the present royals of tanjore are maharastrian.<br />  the telugus ruled before that<br />  the cholas were out of tanjore by 1300. so no hope of anybody there<br />  possesing that precious DNA.<br />  but seriously speaking nithya , do you think DNA alone makes a<br />  difference?<br />  so many of rajaraja&#39;s descendants could not even be compared to him.<br />  lacklusture men who dared to sit on the same throne as him.<br /> <br />  and while speaking of dna testing we do need a credible sample to<br />  test against.<br />  last month the remnants of 2 of russia&#39;s last royal family were<br />  tested against the dna of prince philip of england who was related to<br />  them.<br />  but dont lose heart.<br /> <br />  there are families which claim to be descendants. especially on<br />  zamindar family of pichavaram near chidamabaram still &#39;crowns &#39; its<br />  elder in nataraja temple.<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br />   <br />    for that matterâ€¦ for the entire Tamil kingdom.
