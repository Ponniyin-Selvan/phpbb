			<div class="content">Dear members,<br /><br />A friend who is reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> (in English translation, sadly!) asked me<br />why Pazhuvettaraiyar seemingly orders the guard to stab Kandanmaran<br />while he is leaving the Suranga paadhai in vol. 1. The reasons, if I<br />remember, are not explained later in the novel. I guessed that it was<br />probably because he knew too many secrets, i.e., the suranga paadhai,<br />madurantaka devar being brought that way, or seeing Nandini in the<br />secret passage. I was wondering if there is a past discussion on this<br />in the archive....I am not too convinced by my guesses. After all,<br />Pazhuvettaraiyar needed Kadamboor Sambuvaraiyar's help at that point,<br />and it would have been inconvenient to have his son killed. Pl. let me<br />know if this discussion is already in the archive.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Suneeta</div>

			<div class="content">Thanks...I did think it had something to do with Kandanmaran returning<br />by the suranga paadhai after sending Madurantakar and meeting<br />Pazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini unexpectedly. I seem to have forgotten<br />about his mistaking Nandini for Pazhuvettaraiyar's daughter. Is it<br />revealed later that he mistook her for the daughter? It still is a<br />pretty devious twist to the plot that he is stabbed!</div>

Who is Nandini? When Ram (our <br />moderator) approached me for a weekly article based on the <br />discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how to start. <br />After much head scratching I thought<br />I would like to begin this series with a question which pops in all <br />our minds while we read this great epic Â– "Who is Nandini?" I wonder <br />if there was a more complex character created at all by any author. <br />And the way Kalki builds her character through the entire novel is<br />beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we get to know a new <br />facet about her character and equally a new secret about her life. <br />Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />woman in a<br />palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. When <br />Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />powerful woman with a<br />fleet of servants to do her bidding and she also wields enough power <br />to help him get inside the Fort. After Vandiya Devan meets her we <br />know that she is an exceptionally beautiful woman. And what better <br />way could there be to compare her beauty with that of Kundavai's than<br />through a man's eyes! But it is certain that Nandini's magnetism and <br />beauty are unparalleled in the novel and she cleverly uses it as a <br />lever to wrap men around her little finger. She has a success rate <br />of 99% in creating love sick puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, <br />Aditya Karikalan, Pallava Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match <br />in Vandiya Devan who is unfazed by her hypnotic beauty. The war of <br />will between these two characters is beautiful. flirtatious yet <br />determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan escapes from <br />being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web. Why does Nandini try to <br />entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the reason immediately because <br />he does not want his audience to get the wrong impression about her. <br />She is associated with the Pandya spies who want avenge their king's <br />death. Through the course of the novel we see different <br />kaleidoscopic images of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and <br />also as an unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many <br />people. Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for <br />sure that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman? I think we can safely leave Sundara <br />Chola out of the discussion because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan <br />were born two years after Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom. The <br />crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />memory and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas. Karuthiruman leaves <br />them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the Pandya King's message to <br />the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall in love with her? Did <br />Mandakini have an affair with him? Now let's discuss the other <br />possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to Azhvarkadiyan that he is the <br />father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. Could this be true? We know <br />that later he falls in love with Vani, Mandakini's twin sister. <br />Could that be because he was reminded of<br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />recognize him? The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these <br />two individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />Karai by her<br />father. But when he arrives there he finds that Mandakini has had <br />another accident with result her memory is back. Now she does not <br />recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not know what happened <br />to her from the time she fell from the lighthouse and her last <br />accident. Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman <br />to her? Was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />resembles Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />exceptionally beautiful woman barring the fact that she was <br />handicapped. If we assume that he had an affair with her, this fits <br />in perfectly because I cannot imagine what other business a king <br />like Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to rally <br />support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind other <br />than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had traveled <br />for a short while unless he had developed a special love or <br />affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out what <br />happened to her. Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out <br />what happened to her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his <br />baby? Karuthiruman finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being <br />brought up in Chola household but before he could get this <br />information to the king he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe <br />Veerapandiyan knows that she was pregnant but doesn't know what <br />happened to the babies or to their mother. Ram had earlier raised a <br />question in the group saying that Veerapandiyan who is rescued by <br />Karuthiruman is the father of the Veerapandiyan who is killed by <br />Karikalan. (Ref: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a><!-- m -->) That is also <br />possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 Â– 22 years <br />before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. Either <br />way we get the same answer Â–<br />Nandini is Veerapandiyan's daughter. The second possibility is that <br />Karuthiruman might be the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But <br />I find very little evidence to suggest that. All his actions prove <br />that he has been acting for the Pandya King. So it would be safe to <br />assume that he had lied to Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one <br />little point that we must note. When Karuthiruman narrates his story <br />to Vandiya Devan he starts with a preamble that Â– "Is it Ok if I <br />combine some imagination as well along with the story?" Now which <br />part of it is imagination is difficult for me to concur. After the <br />babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody to <br />wonder how come they both look<br />alike. When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies <br />takes place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to <br />Nandini's house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him <br />from the Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get <br />back at the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />her father? What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he <br />saw Nandini? I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out <br />the fact that Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And <br />he must have told her so as well. But Nandini confuses us all by <br />declaring to Karikalan that Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this <br />declaration takes place in the presence of Veerapandiyan who is <br />alive and kicking. How could she have declared that if she had known <br />that he is her father? Same argument can be put across if we go by <br />Ram's query. If<br />she had realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call <br />her brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic! Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill <br />him if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she<br />needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />mad rage. Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated <br />Karikalan. She had belief in her beauty with which she was able to <br />get all her wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. <br />Karikalan in his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is <br />her lover. Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini <br />might have meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite <br />possible. Even Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few <br />chapters where he<br />and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this! Going ahead <br />with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's daughter it is no <br />surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan the way she did.  <br />Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love. ---------------------<br />------------------------------------------------ Message 152 <br />From: "Pavithra Srinivasan"  Date: Mon Jul 8, <br />2002 9:52 pmSubject: The Nandini Conundrum... Dear Sumeetha... <br />Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br />(I've got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the <br />Veerapandian who had an affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that <br />Nandini was Veerapandian's daughter- and the Veerapandian who died <br />at the hands of Aditha Karikalan were one and the same...this is the <br />first I've ever heard about the 'brother' theory.) I had a <br />discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply <br />that she was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went <br />like this... 1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament <br />would never fall in love with any one in a space of few days (like a <br />wounded Veerapandian after math of the Madurai por). Assuming that <br />she knew something of her parentage by then, this would amount to a <br />classical "Electra complex" case study. 2) A person of Nandini's <br />character and temperament would go to any length - even to calling <br />her father her lover - for attaining what she wants. 3) The <br />chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there is <br />clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar- <br />Mandagini and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two <br />years are filled up with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman <br />account. 4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he <br />picked up both Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left <br />them together in northern Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera <br />Pandiyan's message to Mahindan. And when he returned he found <br />Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle information confirms, <br />Veerapandian as the father of mandagini's twins. 5) The nature of <br />the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers from a <br />serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all the <br />trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, <br />in "Nandiniyin kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of <br />Nandini being Veera Pandiyan's lover. In my opinion this is a <br />standard<br />trick of thodar kadhai genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki <br />would have got no inclination about how big or how long the novel <br />was going to be at that time. Later some two years later, he could <br />have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not the lover of <br />Veerapandian as he originally intended. 6) There is one more angle - <br />that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her father,when he sought refuge <br />in her house. She wanted to get back at him for abandoning his <br />mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she does what <br />she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her <br />lover, so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri<br />at that person - in this case VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini <br />took revenge on her father for leaving her mother destitute. Later <br />when she grieves for her father, she conveniently forgets that she <br />is the primary reason for his death and swears vengeance on the <br />cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the section that view <br />Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi character <br />who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her. 7) The case <br />for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan's lover is weak. Abathudavi's claim <br />that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died. <br />This could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his <br />progeny (the Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). <br />Thinking of a way<br />to include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her <br />as the patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the <br />continuing confrontation against the cholas after his time. He <br />doesn't know whether his official heirs have survived (like the <br />kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So he makes Nandini legitimate and <br />loyal to the Pandiyan cause. Well, what does everybody think? I also <br />thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she <br />merely a victim of circumstance??? I've<br />certain arguments there too...what do you think, Sumi? <br />Ciaow...Pavithra. <br /><br />Message 154 From: "Sumeetha vijayaraghavan"  <br />Date: Tue Jul 9, 2002 1:03 pmSubject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] The <br />Nandini<br />Conundrum... Hi Pavithra, The angle about Veerapandiyan being <br />Nandini's brother was suggested by Ram in one of his threads here. I <br />think I have given the thread there. I guess we can consider the <br />possibility because if Veerapandiyan senior (the one who met <br />Karuthiruman and Mandakini) is the same one killed by Karikalan then <br />we can expect him to quite old. I guess it is difficult for think <br />that she would have fallen in love with him. But Nandini as a <br />character has puzzled me a lot for various reasons -If she wanted to <br />take revenge on the Cholas or especially Kundavai for their <br />treatment towards her the best revenge would be to marry Karikalan. <br />Being the elder brother's wife I am sure we can expect Kundavai to <br />be subservient to her in position and power. Yet she goes ahead and <br />spoils it all by telling karikalan that she had fallen in love with <br />the wounded man. Did she do it just to scorn<br />Karikalan? To show him - "You have all the power in the world but I <br />would prefer to marry a wounded and defeated king than become your <br />wife and a part of your arrogant family" Is this what she thought? <br />On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or <br />brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had <br />deliberately turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why? "Electra's <br />complex" - quite possible. It can also be a deep yearning to be a <br />part of something important and dangerous. Like she<br />sees herself as a heroine liberating, avenging and taking up <br />responsibilities for an entire kingdom. We should also not forget <br />that her revenge is a double edged sword both on Veerapandiyan and <br />Karikalan. She turned Karikalan's anger on Veerapandiyan because she <br />felt that he had abandoned her mother and herself therefore he got <br />his head cut off and in the same time she took revenge on Karikalan <br />for allowing Sembiyanmadevi to send her away. In many ways her <br />revenge on Veerapandiyan was milder because it was<br />Karikalan who had to bear the guilt of his actions which was a <br />bigger revenge.

And congrats Ram <br />for reaching the half-century mark in the member list. I guess we <br />owe a lot to you for giving us an opportunity to discuss and talk <br />about the greatest epic ever written! Ok now let me do some follow <br />ups with the previous week'sarticle. Pavithra had some very <br />interesting insights into Nandini'scharacter. 1. "A person of <br />Nandini's character and temperament<br />would neverfall in love with any one in a space of few days (like a <br />wounded Veerapandian aftermath of the Madurai por). Assuming that <br />she knew something of her parentage by then, this would amount to a <br />classical "Electra complex" case study." Now the Electra complex <br />angle was<br />something, which I had not thought about at all. That should explain <br />her attachment as well as her anger towards her father. 2. "A person <br />of Nandini's character and temperament would go toany length - even <br />to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she<br />wants." I guess that should answer Prathiba's question. 3. "There is <br />one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian washer father, when <br />he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him for <br />abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, <br />she<br />does what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else <br />her lover, so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - <br />in this case VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her <br />father for leaving her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for <br />her father, she conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason <br />for his death and swears vengeance on the cholas. This<br />school of thought is advocated by the section that view Nandini as <br />an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi character who just <br />wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her." This is also quite <br />possible but we can only surmise that she wanted to be a part of <br />something<br />that is important and royal though she was responsible for <br />Veerapandiyan's death. It can also be a deepyearning to be a part of <br />something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a <br />heroine liberating, avenging and taking up responsibilities for an <br />entire kingdom. Was Nandini unstable? I frankly do not know. She <br />seems to be quite in control of her emotions and actions. The only <br />times we see<br />the struggle within her is when she is with Vandiya Devan. But to me <br />personally she is one of the most beautiful and yet complex <br />character created in literature. "The case for Nandini being Veera <br />Pandiyan's lover is weak. Abathudavi's claim that Veerapandian made <br />Nandini his patta magishi before he died. This could be explained as <br />Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny (the Mandagini - <br />Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of a way to <br />include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as <br />the patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the <br />continuing confrontation against the cholas after his time. He <br />doesn't<br />know whether his official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai <br />vandiyathevan meets). So he makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to <br />the Pandiyan cause." Here I would like to add I.M lakshmi's views as <br />well Â–"when Veerapandiyan escaped from Porkallam and met Nandhini he <br />would have mistaken Nandhini for Mandhahini. So he may have said <br />something to Nandhini as if he said it to Mandhahini.This may be the <br />reason for Veerapandian claiming nandhini as his <br />Pattamahishi.Nandhini would have worked out the truth from what he <br />said." But Lakshmi I don't agree with you. There no way <br />thatVeerapandiyan - no matter how injured he is could mistake <br />Nandini to be<br />Mandakini. The first reason being the age factor and the second <br />being the fact that Nandini is not handicapped unlike her mother. So <br />there are chances that he must have recognized her as his daughter. <br />In the end Pavithra asked me a question Â– "Is Nandhini really a <br />villi...or is she merely a victim of circumstance???" I agree with <br />the latter part of her question. Nandini is undoubtedly a victim of <br />circumstances whose life has been manipulated by many people. If you <br />remember in the fourth part of the novel Kalki himself devotes an <br />entire chapter trying to unravel the turmoil of her heart where he <br />compares her life with her mother's and describes how<br />Mandakini had only the wild animals to deal with in her life in <br />jungle where as her daughter had to suffer a lot being brought up <br />amidst people. Hope that answers your question Pavithra! Guys if you <br />have any other thoughts or points to pen down please do so. I will <br />round them all up in another follow up. Message 171 <br />From: "Pavithra Srinivasan"  Date: Wed Jul 24, <br />2002 8:45 pmSubject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] The Nandini Conundrum... <br />Dear<br />Sumeetha... Sorry for the rather long gap- but I'm back anyway.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br />Your views gave me a good deal of food for thought- I found myself <br />doing a lot of thinking on what you've said. About what you've said <br />about Nandhini exacting her revenge by marrying Karikalan- I though <br />of another view-point. Most of the times, the daughter-in-law of a <br />household weilds power only in name- she's generally expected to <br />keep back and do what her husband/mother-in-law tells her. The real <br />power, sometimes lies with the daughter of the house-in this case, <br />Kundhavai. Kundavai is not just the daughter of the Chola emperor, <br />but she's very popular with the masses too, and held in great esteem <br />by her people. Nandhini would be thrown into the shadow, while <br />Kundhavai would still retain her prominence. In essence, she may not <br />have been able to get her revenge at all. What do<br />you think?  On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either <br />her father or  brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she <br />had deliberately  turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why? Do you mean, <br />why she made Karikalan kill<br />Veerapandian? For one thing, she is of the opinion that Karikalan <br />jilted her- in her heart of hearts, she wanted him to win her back <br />in spite of opposition. When he didn't do it, she became furious. <br />And what better way to take her revenge than to make him kill her <br />supposed lover Veerapandian (who was already three-fourths dead <br />anyway, and wouldn't have survived) in a fit of anger (notice: she <br />knows exactly how karikalan will react after he commits the deed of <br />killing her 'beloved' and knows that he will regret it because he <br />has hurt her terribly) then blame him forever? Personally, its my <br />opinion that Nandhini didn't care much about the Pandya Kingdom <br />either. *She* had been hurt by the Cholas and been humiliated by <br />them, therefore she decided to hurt them as much as she could, <br />notably Karikalan. Well...what do you think? BTW, Imli, your photos <br />are cool:-) (How are your studies going on?) Looking forward to <br />hearing more from you guys, Pavithra. Message 188 From: "Seshadri <br />Gokul"  Date: Wed Aug 14, 2002 3:36 pmSubject:  <br />Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father Veera pandiyan MAY NOT <br />be Nandhini's father Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting <br />insights into Nandhini's parentage. My full appreciation to their <br />efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative. * Pavitra says <br />Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form ofinconsistency <br />and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan - nandini's father <br />and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not true !  <br />Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not <br />only in the first part (Pudhu vellam) (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but <br />even also in the fourth part ! Just before the murder of Aditya, The <br />head of Pandiyan appears before nandhini - and she exclaims and <br />talks in hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? <br />Welcome !....and so on ...". In fact if you carefully read the <br />novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera Pandiyan <br />she always says that he is her lover - Even at that critical moment <br />when Pandiya is in great danger! * There is only one place where <br />there is a contradiction - when she has her final talk with Aditya. <br />Even here, Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like <br />this : Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father <br />is................." Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he <br />overheard this conversation and heard that she was mentioning the <br />name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide <br />this fact directly during Nandhini's final dialogue and provides the <br />info at a much later stage ? I think there is a very very definite <br />purpose and I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly <br />ref my last lines in this mail) * Thus Kalki very deleberately <br />presents a very consistent picture throughout the Novel that Veera <br />pandiyan is indeed Nandhini's Lover. * The arguements that support <br />the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's father come from Karuthiruman. <br />But please remember - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his <br />story. At one point of time he says he fathered nandhini! - This <br />fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to<br />pandiyas. - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret <br />to Vandhiyathevan, that too during a time pass chat ! Remember that <br />he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly ! - Thus all of his statments <br />are to be rejected. Infact this fellow is more dangerous that all <br />others and there is more to him that what meets the eye (I plan to <br />write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future). * In <br />the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> ( I don't know whether <br />all of you have read the conclusion. It is very important for the <br />novel as a whole), Kalki says : "Just before her death, Nandhini <br />reveals her birth secret to Arulmozhi..." If Kalki felt that the <br />secret has already been revealed through Vandhiyathevan he need not <br />have written these lines at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately <br />confused the readers - he had many more ideas about the characters <br />them selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even <br />further ! Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF <br />NOT VEERA PANDIYAN????? I plan to take this topic in the near <br />future.

			<div class="content">My humble take on Nandhini's complex relationship with<br />Veerapandiyan is just that she really did not know who<br />he was. He could have been father/brother/lover<br />anyone, it is left to our imagination and quite<br />understandable how we can be confused as readers.<br /><br />Nandhini's character though is just an abandoned woman<br />who wants to use her beauty and brains to seek revenge<br />on the world for the love and care she did not get as<br />a child. Like many women in that situation she is<br />often vulnerable to those who treat her with kindness<br />and as a human instead of a beauty object - Periya<br />Pazhuvetariar, Karikalan and Veerapandiyan were the<br />only 3 people in her life who gave her respect so she<br />responded like wise that is all.<br /><br /><br />--- Sivapathasekaran  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Reposting Dr. Sridhar&#39;s posting in March 2002 !<br />  almost 6 years back !!!!!!!!!!!<br />  :: <br /> <br />  And could see member v suneetha&#39;s mails too !<br /> <br />  wonderful participation by all.<br /> <br />  thanks Sri &#40; again &#41;<br /> <br />  sps<br />  --------------<br /> <br />  Digest: Nandhini<br />  ---------------<br /> <br />  Dear all<br /> <br />  I have attched the archived discussions as a<br />  digest......Hope you<br />  like it<br /> <br />  Sri<br /> <br />  Nandhinis father<br /> <br /> <br />  From: "ramchi412" <br />  Date: Thu Mar 21, 2002 1:19 am<br />  Subject: hai<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  I have read ponniyin selvan quite a few times but I<br />  think Kalki has<br />  confused a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>.......probably sliped a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> when he<br />  was walking<br />  between the thin line of reality and<br />  Imagination.......<br />  In one perspective we can conclude that<br />  Nandini&#39;s father is the Pandiya king who took Oomai<br />  raani with him when she as unconcious...the pandia<br />  king who died<br />  in the battle with Karikalan is his son....so<br />  nandini is his<br />  sister...<br />  In another perspective.......<br />  i gathered that nandini and mathurandakan were born<br />  to oomai rani,<br />  but still it is not clear about who their father.<br />  most<br />  presumably<br />  it was Pandiya king. but then again kalki raises a<br />  doubt because<br />  "how can nandini refer to her father as her lover"<br />  and in her<br />  hallucinations, nandini refers to the pandiya king<br />  as<br />  "anbe"........<br />  Not only me lot many people in the world are<br />  confused abt.<br />  If someone could throw some light on this I would be<br />  grateful.<br />  endrendrum anbudan,<br />  Ram<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  From: Lavanya Venkiteswaran <br />  Date: Mon Jun 10, 2002 4:00 am<br />  Subject: Raja Raja chola....<br /> <br />  Hi<br />  This is mainly with respect to the question "Who is<br />  Nandini?" The answer to this is not very simple I<br />  guess &#40;if u go by what the History actually would<br />  have<br />  been&#41;and a lot of things have to be brought to light<br />  before answering this.<br />  Instead of answering this question I would like to<br />  write a lot other things i learnt in the last couple<br />  of days during my travel to the Chola kingdom of<br />  Rajaraja chola....I had been on a religious trip to<br />  some temples near kudanthai n trichy and i happened<br />  to<br />  see the Pallippadai which Rajendra chola, son of<br />  raja<br />  raja chola has built for Panchavanmaadevi &#40;one of<br />  the<br />  wives of Rajarajan&#41;. The question now is why did<br />  rajendra build a temple for only one of his<br />  stepmothers&#40;n note it : not even for his mother?&#41; n<br />  even then why only to this stepmother?! Please try n<br />  ponder over it...<br />  In the meanwhile i will try n compose a mail of<br />  all that i have learnt in the past few days from Mr.<br />  Sundhar Bhardawaj, who is an ardent fan of kalki, a<br />  very close friend of Balakumaran n who is spending a<br />  lot of his efforts in unearthing the chola history<br />  especially around the time of rajaraja chola...<br />  I am not as good a story teller as he is... but i<br />  will try my best n pass on the information to you<br />  asap...<br />  Bye till then<br />  Lavanya<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  From: "Sumeetha V" <br />  Date: Mon Jun 10, 2002 9:10 am<br />  Subject: RE: Re: [ponniyinselvan] NanDini!!!!!<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Yes shankar u r right.
