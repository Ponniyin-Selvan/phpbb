			<div class="content">Thanks Vijay , that was a wonderful narration, <br />i had know a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> about the Muslim invasion in down south, but not in detailas you have given in your mail.<br /> <br />I suppose this community is named after a Great King, called Raja Raja Cholan, whom himself built such a great monument in Tanjai. <br />It was love for God which pursued him to construct that temple in such a magnificent scale. With such a big temple was to sing, to dance and relish almightyâ€™s names, and if this is to termed â€œMuttalâ€ or Katumirandiâ€¦â€¦I am in loose of words. <br /> <br /> <br />As rightly pointed out by Malathi, the discussion out of this is not going to lead anywhere and it might prbly dig and salt the old wounds.<br />I am a Tamil and i proudly say it so...i donâ€™t care weather any body would consider me Tamil or not since because i hail from a particular community. <br />We have thousand things to cherish upon like Divaya prabandham, Thrivaimozhi, Devaram and N number of things.. To enjoy the nectar called Tamil.<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Vijay Kumar .S <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Thursday, April 17, 2008 8:56:49 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: iniya puthandu vazhthukkal<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Now let us slightly go back to POST GAZNI - or Malik Gafur in <br />  Southern India &#40;say 1350 AD&#41; Just prior to Vijayanagara &#40;in about <br />  1500 AD&#41;!<br />  <br />  From about 1320 AD - Tamilnadu confronted with the following:</div></blockquote>Dear sps<br /><br />Just today i was seeing this reference... talk of <br />coincidences. ....also venkat your madurai - when is it going to come <br />out in tamil...<br /><br />1311C.E.- Attacks by Malik Kafur, the general of Allauddin Khilji: <br /><br />According the traditional accounts, the Muslim army lead by Malik <br />Kafur entered the Srirangam temple throught the northern gateway of <br />the 3rd enclosure. The resistance of the Brahmins was overcome <br />easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and numerous <br />icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray however did <br />not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all the <br />treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The temple <br />rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.<br /><br />1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam temple: <br /><br />Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest son <br />Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in 1321 C.E. <br />When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of which the <br />procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby shrine. The <br />gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and the <br />festival was continued. When the invaders reached Samayapuram, <br />Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the temple, <br />decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away the <br />procession image of the deity in the southern direction secretly, <br />with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, he <br />dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few boxes <br />of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the doors <br />of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines of both <br />Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images outside <br />and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, including the <br />great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri Vedanta <br />Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the sole <br />manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri Sudarsana, <br />and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, they <br />fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika published <br />the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally housed in <br />the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after Pillai <br />Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his kith <br />and kin at Srirangam.<br /><br />The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an end to <br />Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the invading <br />general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple altogether, <br />and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few cornices. The <br />Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the occupying <br />Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked by <br />disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved to the <br />nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />fortress at its place. <br /><br />The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the mention <br />of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the Muslim <br />chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the pretext of <br />showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and killed <br />him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a result of <br />her deed, she threw herself also down. According to tradition, to <br />honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are lit by <br />fire brought from the temple kitchen.<br /><br />In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar wrested <br />back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon hidden <br />at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.<br /><br />1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French: <br /><br />During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of the <br />French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the temple, and <br />were planning on harassing the entire population that had taken <br />refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy on <br />behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist of the <br />harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the occupying <br />troops, including the molestation of women. The inner precincts of <br />the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers of <br />the army of Chanda Saheb. <br /><br />1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali: <br /><br />Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded Srirangam in <br />1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the disaster.<br /><br />1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan: <br /><br />Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 C.E. with <br />his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. He <br />stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded 100000 <br />gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The demand was <br />refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, Tippu <br />had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his vengeance <br />upon the temple.<br /><br />____________ _________ ___<br /><br />The instance below took place during the 'Carnatic Wars' (1743-1763) <br />fought between the British and the French for the control of South <br />India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along these two <br />European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and the <br />Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with the <br />French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab of <br />Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi (1732-36) of <br />the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the indignities <br />heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb's men, the queen took poison and <br />died in 1736. During his rule (1736-1740), Chanda Saheb harassed the <br />temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money from <br />them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading Maratha <br />forces in 1740.<br /><br />"Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga Pillai, <br />the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix ( = the French <br />Commander), states; 'Today I heard the following news. Of the troops <br />at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 troopers have <br />received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money to <br />live on and have suffered much from the enemy's (= the British) <br />blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam temple just <br />as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple people <br />saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the grain <br />stored there." (pg. 212)<br /><br />When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who worked for <br />Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple and <br />ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, the <br />British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.<br /><br />Reference: <br />V. N.

			<div class="content">Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />said, TN is one of the most casteist states. Casteism<br />is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In parts of<br />Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used to<br />live, there are whole villages that are christian and<br />muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />true fact.<br /><br />During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins employed<br />with British like Venkat said. Temples were largely<br />governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />brahmin communities particularly widows was very poor.<br />All these factors contributed him to start the<br />struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR was<br />alive today he would continue this struggle the same<br />way or even use the same language that he did.<br /><br />I have shown the EVR site to american atheists even,<br />before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />them on his history and service. They did understand<br />but many of them felt in all respect that the quotes<br />of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu mirandi'<br />were completely outdated with today's times. Atheism<br />in the west places huge emphasis on give and take of<br />respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are rewritten.<br />Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />wonder, would our dravidian friends consider putting a<br />disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do not<br />include many believers who have supported anti<br />casteism and rational thought? I am sure the answer<br />you will get is total silence.<br /><br />I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility to go<br />through archives for all that has been said on the<br />subject but when I do perhaps will have more questions<br /><img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) Thanks.<br /><br />--- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br />  i for one have come from one of the most casteist<br />  areas of tamil nadu.<br />  a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />  every year for the<br />  high tensions prevailing during the ther function.<br />  the government has<br />  cancelled the ther rather than shed blood sometimes.<br /> <br />  the swarna murthy temple is owned by the sivaganga<br />  queen, was rebuilt<br />  and embellished with sculpture by the nagarathars.<br />  but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />  dalits.<br /> <br />  where did the bramhin come into this?<br />  the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the picture.<br /> <br />  this example i am quoting to &#39;absolve" the bramhin<br />  community of<br />  creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />  the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945<br />  was not the<br />  bramhin if you take village wise.<br />  the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars<br />  and the vandayars<br />  in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />  reddiars in mid<br />  tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the<br />  thevars in the<br />  south etc....<br />  they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />  local school and<br />  generally decided who had to do what. if you observe<br />  without bias<br />  these caste configurations still prevail in these<br />  areas.<br />  the aim of the &#39;justice party&#39; was to target<br />  braminism not in village<br />  level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />  a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />  aptitude for learning<br />  caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />  british india. the<br />  justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />  this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled<br />  them towards<br />  greener pastures.<br /> <br />  like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer.<br />  my family was<br />  closely involved in the justice party in the early<br />  years.<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu<br />  Prakash<br />  R"  wrote: <br />   <br />    Sathish<br />   <br />    Having some familiarity with the tamil movement<br />  in the last 150<br />    years and read through a few of the books, here<br />  are my comments.<br />   <br />    1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />  Tamilnadu as a<br />    antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />  these areas. Refer<br />    Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />  movement fostered<br />    primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />  the Athinams of<br />    these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />  and promote<br />  Saivism<br />    as an active alternative.<br />    2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />  Saivism is based on<br />    the fact that it lead to the contact with &#39;low&#39;<br />  castes and the<br />    language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />  &#39;exclusivity&#39; of<br />    sanskrit.<br />    3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />  look into the<br />    history of the ascendent &#39;low&#39; castes/high castes<br />  of these times<br />    &#40;like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc&#41;, they<br />  ended up building<br />    temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />  and the pooja was<br />    done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />  Kuladeivam temple is<br />    in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />  my talks with the<br />    poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />  atleast 3-4<br />    generations. This is also recorded in the<br />  Hardgrave&#39;s history on<br />    Nadars and Caldwell&#39;s history on Thirunelveli<br />  &#40;both are available<br />    and in print&#41;. This is true in any number of<br />  temples built by the<br />    low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />  perunthivangal.<br />    4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />  society in terms of<br />    prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />  the Brahmins who<br />    were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />  was found to not<br />    yield results, they sort of &#39;rebelled&#39; and<br />  asserted themselves by<br />    building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />    5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />  of you here for<br />    the kind of reaction espoused by DK &#40;the Justice<br />  party before that&#41;<br />    is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />  oppression that<br />    went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />  the late last<br />    century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />  above along with<br />    the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />  to it in<br />    U.Ve.Sa&#39;s &#39;En sarithiram&#39;, the journals of the<br />  Saveriraya pillai<br />    &#40;who converted to Christianity&#41; etc. It is no use<br />  just expressing<br />    outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />  context.<br />    Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />  avoiding the<br />    Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />  DK. If you look<br />    into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />  comes from a<br />  very<br />    religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />  the downtrodden.<br />    Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />  change the system<br />    from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />  break up the<br />  entire<br />    system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />  Ramayan and<br />  other<br />    established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />  aside and a new<br />    society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />  now.<br />   <br />    The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />  Tamil, for better or<br />    worse and it is not a &#39;religious fundamentalist&#39;<br />  movement but a<br />    nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />  from years of<br />    oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />  people together<br />    and build a new society.

			<div class="content">SPS, scholars are rarely acceptable to masses, the<br />vast majority of masses are illiterate people who live<br />hand to mouth existence, what do they care about<br />whether their leader is tamil scholar or not?<br /><br />I don't know what context you mean - but I have always<br />maintaned mass popularity in any cutlure and any<br />country does not mean anything in particular. I mean<br />it could be certain qualities the person has, good<br />qualities but there are hundreds of people with<br />similar qualities.

I have known<br />  westerners,<br />    completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana<br />  and<br />    were very impressed by qualities they found. They<br />  did<br />    find issues too but not like the mindset the<br />  DKites<br />    had.<br />   <br />    I realize you want to close the thread, as this is<br />  not<br />    going to lead anywhere anyway.

To do away with &#39;give<br />  and<br />    take respect&#39; is even more uncivilised. I have<br />    attended meetings of Atheist associations in<br />  america<br />    also.

Second in western<br />  countries<br />    you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />    other person &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattumirandi&#39;.

There his opposition for<br />  Ramayan and other<br />  established scriptures which need to be tossed aside<br />  and a new<br />  society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />  now.<br /> <br />  The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a Tamil,<br />  for better or<br />  worse and it is not a &#39;religious fundamentalist&#39;<br />  movement but a<br />  nationalist movement trying to free the masses from<br />  years of<br />  oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />  people together<br />  and build a new society.

Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />    Tamilnadu as a <br />      antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />    these areas. Refer <br />      Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />    movement fostered <br />      primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />    the Athinams of <br />      these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />    and promote <br />    Saivism <br />      as an active alternative.<br />      2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />    Saivism is based on <br />      the fact that it lead to the contact with &#39;low&#39;<br />    castes and the <br />      language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />    &#39;exclusivity&#39; of <br />      sanskrit.<br />      3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />    look into the <br />      history of the ascendent &#39;low&#39; castes/high castes<br />    of these times <br />      &#40;like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc&#41;, they<br />    ended up building <br />      temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />    and the pooja was <br />      done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />    Kuladeivam temple is <br />      in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />    my talks with the <br />      poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />    atleast 3-4 <br />      generations. This is also recorded in the<br />    Hardgrave&#39;s history on <br />      Nadars and Caldwell&#39;s history on Thirunelveli<br />    &#40;both are available <br />      and in print&#41;. This is true in any number of<br />    temples built by the <br />      low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />    perunthivangal. <br />      4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />    society in terms of <br />      prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />    the Brahmins who <br />      were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />    was found to not <br />      yield results, they sort of &#39;rebelled&#39; and<br />    asserted themselves by <br />      building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />      5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />    of you here for <br />      the kind of reaction espoused by DK &#40;the Justice<br />    party before that&#41; <br />      is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />    oppression that <br />      went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />    the late last <br />      century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />    above along with <br />      the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />    to it in <br />      U.Ve.Sa&#39;s &#39;En sarithiram&#39;, the journals of the<br />    Saveriraya pillai <br />      &#40;who converted to Christianity&#41; etc. It is no use<br />    just expressing <br />      outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />    context. <br />      Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />    avoiding the <br />      Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />    DK. If you look <br />      into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />    comes from a <br />    very <br />      religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />    the downtrodden. <br />      Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />    change the system <br />      from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />    break up the <br />    entire <br />      system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />    Ramayan and <br />    other <br />      established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />    aside and a new <br />      society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />    now.<br />      <br />      The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />    Tamil, for better or <br />      worse and it is not a &#39;religious fundamentalist&#39;<br />    movement but a <br />      nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />    from years of <br />      oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />    people together <br />      and build a new society. How much good/bad came<br />    out of it is <br />      debatable. <br />      <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogpost.com">http://sibipranav.blogpost.com</a><!-- m --><br />      <br />      <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - As an aside my father spent a day in the<br />    police station during <br />      the 1964 agitations for taking part in a<br />    anti-hindi rally in <br />      Madurai.

I know many <br />people who dont get offended by this and understand the reality and <br />necessity of this statement, like our SPS and Nithya.<br /><br />The most effective way to make an illiterate mass to HEAR (listening <br />is after that) to what you say could be this. Kind of shock treatment <br />for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting 'Maaaarchhhh...' <br />in the middle of his speech. If we ask him 'Swami, why did you <br />shout?', his reply would be 'thoongaravanellaam ezhundhirikka <br />vendaamaa?'. Its more or less similar to that. There may be any other <br />better way, but periyar thought this would work out well where <br />superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething for slipper <br />garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we dont worship.<br /><br />Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was misunderstood. <br />Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that these puranas have <br />good things too. But there are many other people to explain that. <br />Periyar's motive was different. If anything makes the man slave to <br />another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it without any <br />hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it is Thamizhp <br />pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit into this category, <br />suggest to read his 'Characters of Ramayana' and Anna's 'Aariya <br />maayai' or 'Needhi dhevan mayakkam'. The court scene in needhi dhevan <br />mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu samudhram case also.<br /><br />Regards<br />A.Kumaraguruparan<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />  said, TN is one of the most casteist states. Casteism<br />  is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus.

Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />  escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />  true fact.<br />  <br />  During EVR&#39;s time there were lot of brahmins employed<br />  with British like Venkat said. Temples were largely<br />  governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />  brahmin communities particularly widows was very poor.<br />  All these factors contributed him to start the<br />  struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR was<br />  alive today he would continue this struggle the same<br />  way or even use the same language that he did. <br />  <br />  I have shown the EVR site to american atheists even,<br />  before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />  them on his history and service.

Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />    Tamilnadu as a <br />      antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />    these areas. Refer <br />      Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />    movement fostered <br />      primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />    the Athinams of <br />      these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />    and promote <br />    Saivism <br />      as an active alternative.<br />      2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />    Saivism is based on <br />      the fact that it lead to the contact with &#39;low&#39;<br />    castes and the <br />      language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />    &#39;exclusivity&#39; of <br />      sanskrit.<br />      3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />    look into the <br />      history of the ascendent &#39;low&#39; castes/high castes<br />    of these times <br />      &#40;like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc&#41;, they<br />    ended up building <br />      temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />    and the pooja was <br />      done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />    Kuladeivam temple is <br />      in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />    my talks with the <br />      poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />    atleast 3-4 <br />      generations. This is also recorded in the<br />    Hardgrave&#39;s history on <br />      Nadars and Caldwell&#39;s history on Thirunelveli<br />    &#40;both are available <br />      and in print&#41;. This is true in any number of<br />    temples built by the <br />      low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />    perunthivangal. <br />      4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />    society in terms of <br />      prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />    the Brahmins who <br />      were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />    was found to not <br />      yield results, they sort of &#39;rebelled&#39; and<br />    asserted themselves by <br />      building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />      5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />    of you here for <br />      the kind of reaction espoused by DK &#40;the Justice<br />    party before that&#41; <br />      is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />    oppression that <br />      went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />    the late last <br />      century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />    above along with <br />      the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />    to it in <br />      U.Ve.Sa&#39;s &#39;En sarithiram&#39;, the journals of the<br />    Saveriraya pillai <br />      &#40;who converted to Christianity&#41; etc. It is no use<br />    just expressing <br />      outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />    context. <br />      Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />    avoiding the <br />      Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />    DK. If you look <br />      into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />    comes from a <br />    very <br />      religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />    the downtrodden. <br />      Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />    change the system <br />      from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />    break up the <br />    entire <br />      system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />    Ramayan and <br />    other <br />      established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />    aside and a new <br />      society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />    now.<br />      <br />      The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />    Tamil, for better or <br />      worse and it is not a &#39;religious fundamentalist&#39;<br />    movement but a <br />      nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />    from years of <br />      oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />    people together <br />      and build a new society.

			<div class="content">AK, I was hoping to stop but it looks like it is not<br />yet time.<br /><br />. So the statement was put in to 'wake up' masses??<br />How long has it been since masses actually believed<br />priests and brahmins?<br />And how many DMK politicians including Kalaignar have<br />taken total advantage of their ignorance for getting<br />votes and staying in office? It was a time when EVR<br />said that, how many years have gone by? Nowadays an<br />average brahmin boy or girl cannot even get college<br />admission.Most brahmins like someone said have gone<br />abroad to further their living.<br /><br />Second I don't think you can group<br />Periyar/Anna/Kalignar like they all have same values<br />and principles. Periyar was from the freedom fighers<br />generation, he was unselfish and committed to his<br />cause. The cause was diluted in Anna's times. Perhaps<br />the only thing you can respect about Kalaignar is that<br />he is a tamil scholar. He is one of the most corrupt<br />politicians there ever was.<br /><br />Lastly reasons are not excuses. The fact that someone<br />else is poor/illiterate/some way is not mine or your<br />excuse to treat others with rudeness and disrespect.<br />If you are poor, illiterate, one of those conditions<br />and you call a believer 'kattu mirandi' I can forgive,<br />perhaps. The fact that so many like you are educated,<br />literate people writing on these blogs and using<br />'those' people as an excuse to propogate this rudeness<br />is itself unethical and demeaning.<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- akumarg1976  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />  putting a<br />    disclaimer, that &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattu mirandi&#39; do<br />  not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />  answer<br />    you will get is total silence.<br /> <br />  It obviously means that only. No need for any<br />  disclaimer. I know many<br />  people who dont get offended by this and understand<br />  the reality and<br />  necessity of this statement, like our SPS and<br />  Nithya.<br /> <br />  The most effective way to make an illiterate mass to<br />  HEAR &#40;listening<br />  is after that&#41; to what you say could be this. Kind<br />  of shock treatment<br />  for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting<br />  &#39;Maaaarchhhh...&#39;<br />  in the middle of his speech. If we ask him &#39;Swami,<br />  why did you<br />  shout?&#39;, his reply would be &#39;thoongaravanellaam<br />  ezhundhirikka<br />  vendaamaa?&#39;. Its more or less similar to that. There<br />  may be any other<br />  better way, but periyar thought this would work out<br />  well where<br />  superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething<br />  for slipper<br />  garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we<br />  dont worship.<br /> <br />  Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was<br />  misunderstood.<br />  Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />  these puranas have<br />  good things too. But there are many other people to<br />  explain that.<br />  Periyar&#39;s motive was different. If anything makes<br />  the man slave to<br />  another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it<br />  without any<br />  hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it<br />  is Thamizhp<br />  pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit<br />  into this category,<br />  suggest to read his &#39;Characters of Ramayana&#39; and<br />  Anna&#39;s &#39;Aariya<br />  maayai&#39; or &#39;Needhi dhevan mayakkam&#39;. The court scene<br />  in needhi dhevan<br />  mayakkam perfectly fits for today&#39;s sethu samudhram<br />  case also.<br /> <br />  Regards<br />  A.Kumaraguruparan<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />  Mahadevan <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />    said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />  Casteism<br />    is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />  parts of<br />    Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used<br />  to<br />    live, there are whole villages that are christian<br />  and<br />    muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />    escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />    true fact.<br />   <br />    During EVR&#39;s time there were lot of brahmins<br />  employed<br />    with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />  largely<br />    governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />    brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />  poor.<br />    All these factors contributed him to start the<br />    struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR<br />  was<br />    alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />  same<br />    way or even use the same language that he did.<br />   <br />    I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />  even,<br />    before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />    them on his history and service. They did<br />  understand<br />    but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />  quotes<br />    of &#39;kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />  mirandi&#39;<br />    were completely outdated with today&#39;s times.<br />  Atheism<br />    in the west places huge emphasis on give and take<br />  of<br />    respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />  rewritten.<br />    Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />    hindus. British edited a popular children&#39;s author<br />    Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />  putting a<br />    disclaimer, that &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattu mirandi&#39; do<br />  not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />  answer<br />    you will get is total silence.<br />   <br />    I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />    rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility<br />  to go<br />    through archives for all that has been said on the<br />    subject but when I do perhaps will have more<br />  questions<br />    <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41; Thanks.<br />   <br />    --- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br />   <br />      Hi<br />      i for one have come from one of the most<br />  casteist<br />      areas of tamil nadu.<br />      a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />      every year for the<br />      high tensions prevailing during the ther<br />  function.<br />      the government has<br />      cancelled the ther rather than shed blood<br />  sometimes.<br />     <br />      the swarna murthy temple is owned by the<br />  sivaganga<br />      queen, was rebuilt<br />      and embellished with sculpture by the<br />  nagarathars.<br />      but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />      dalits.<br />     <br />      where did the bramhin come into this?<br />      the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the<br />  picture.<br />     <br />      this example i am quoting to &#39;absolve" the<br />  bramhin<br />      community of<br />      creating caste divides in a major part of<br />  tamilnadu.<br />      the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900<br />  -1945<br />      was not the<br />      bramhin if you take village wise.<br />      the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the<br />  moopanars<br />      and the vandayars<br />      in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />      reddiars in mid<br />      tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north,<br />  the<br />      thevars in the<br />      south etc....<br />      they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />      local school and<br />      generally decided who had to do what. if you<br />  observe<br />      without bias<br />      these caste configurations still prevail in<br />  these<br />      areas.<br />      the aim of the &#39;justice party&#39; was to target<br />      braminism not in village<br />      level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />      a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />      aptitude for learning<br />      caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />      british india. the<br />      justice party caused a bogey man. a fear<br />  psychosis.<br />      this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly<br />  propelled<br />      them towards<br />      greener pastures.<br />     <br />      like everybody before i need to put in a<br />  disclaimer.<br />      my family was<br />      closely involved in the justice party in the<br />  early<br />      years.<br />     <br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!
