			<div class="content">To all those who support nandini and are aganist vasanthasena,<br /><br />I read all the mails and noted the contents. But you should also appriciate<br />the point that Manohara is a Movie 180 minutes where as ponniyin Selvan is a<br />novel spanning 5 Volumes<br /><br />I am sure many of you in this group might have read The Da Vinci Code and<br />some might have seen the movie as well, apart from reading the book. Well, I<br />belong to the second category. When we saw the movie at home. Every 10th or<br />15th minute I had to pause the movie give them the background of the scene<br />so that my family members could also appriciate, what was written in that<br />book and how the same has been condensed into a movie.<br /><br />The point I am trying to drive here is Had Ponniyin Selvan been made into a<br />film, we might not know how the Nandhini charecter would have shaped out<br />finally. On the contrary only our CM will know how Vasantha Sena's charecter<br />would have shaped had Manohara been written as a Novel.<br /><br />Well, Athai-kku Meesai mulacha Chitappa! (Athaikku Meesai Molachathaane<br />Chitappa, neither was <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> taken into a movie nor manohara into a novel.) I<br />will salute the democracy and will accept the verdict of the majority.<br /><br />luv,<br /><br />Udanx.<br /><br /><br /><br />On 7/14/07, Premi baby  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>nandhini may not b liked by many people but underneath in her heart she<br />  placed vandhiyathevan and aadithan in a special place . she even helped<br />  vandhiyathevan at critical situations. but vasantha sena was purely selfish<br />  and planned for others downfall. nandhini was put to critical heart breaking<br />  incidents. she was refused of her basic rights. but vasanthasena was not<br />  hurt by any such incidents . so it is best to say that nandhini is far<br />  better than vasanthasena.<br />  --premi<br /> <br />  *Udanx * wrote:<br /> <br />  Again I beg to differ ...

			<div class="content">accept yours. but the pandyas did outlive the cholas..<br /><br />while on the subject<br /><br />Pandalam in Kerala is the chosen and blessed place where Lord <br />Ayyappa, the presiding deity of Sabarimala had had His human sojourn <br />as the son of the Raja of Pandalam. The Pandalam kingdom was <br />established around 79 ME (903 AD) by the Pandalam royal family who <br />are the descendents of the Pandya kings of Madurai. The Pandya royal <br />family had to flee Madurai because of threats to their lives posed <br />by their own ministers. A branch of the fleeing family moved <br />westward, briefly staying at various places it acquired by purchase. <br />The family kept on the move for over a century, finally reaching <br />Pandalam in 79 ME. This was chosen to be the permanent home for the <br />royal family. The then ruler of Venad (later Travancore) helped to <br />establish the kingdom at Pandalam.
