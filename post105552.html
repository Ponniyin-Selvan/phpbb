			<div class="content">vanakkam,<br /><br />I have typed the first few words... then, I am lost in MS Amma's voice<br />rendering 'vandaadum solai'. Incidentally, the lyrics are by our own<br />Kalki!!<br /><br />It is an aural treat to hear her sing. I've always viewed her as<br />angelic. She never seemed mortal to me. There was an unmistakable<br />'deiveegakak kalai' in her face.<br /><br /><br />Her head rests on a down-turned basket on the floor. Her thick,<br />incredibly curly hair is spread over it after the customary oil bath. As<br />the incense fumes rise from the live coals under the basket, the black<br />waves seem endless and enchanting. The face they frame turns ethereal.<br />Diamond sparks from ear and nose intensify the fragrant dream.<br /><br />When she rises from cloudy repose, she knots her hair, tucks jasmine<br />flowers into its folds, sits before the Gods in the puja (prayer) room<br />and sings with her eyes closed, slender fingers gliding over the tanpura<br />(stringed musical instrument). I become even more convinced that<br />grandaunt Kunjamma is a celestial being. How else could she make music<br />which thrilled you all over?<br /><br /><br />This is the introduction to an article that appeared in Rediff. Here is<br />the link -http://www.rediff.com/style/1998/jan/20ms.htm<br /><br />I have read a lot about how simple her lifestyle was. It must be true<br />that she would have made lot of adjustments. But, that is nothing<br />surprising given that even today, womenfolk make adjustments to suit the<br />menfolk. Be it father, brother, husband or even son!<br /><br />It is surprising to most of us, that she remained docile, despite the<br />fame that made her larger than life. But, she belonged to a different<br />school of upbringing and thought. One of a bygone era. One, that you and<br />me might never even comprehend. At least not me <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />She was conservative to the core, convinced that a woman's place was in<br />the home. She shook her head over "independent" girls, it was one of the<br />few English words in her vocabulary. If you reminded her that she<br />herself was a career woman on hectic professional tours, she would look<br />puzzled and say, "I just did what your Thatha (grandfather) asked me to<br />do. Besides, he was always with me."<br /><br />I remember a hilarious conversation between M.S and a film star<br />activist. "Shouldn't women stand on their own feet?" the young woman<br />asked. "Of course," M.S replied. "I've never done anything against my<br />husband's will." The star persisted, "But women must think for<br />themselves." Grandma agreed, "In fact young women don't think before<br />they act. That is why nowadays there are so many divorces."<br /><br />The star mentioned women's rights. "The woman's dharma is to be meek,<br />and listen to elders, not argue all the time. Look at television! What<br />vulgarity! Times have changed, become so bad," M.S. shook her head.<br /><br />Everything else apart, her voice moves one to another plane,<br />transcending all boundaries. Her rendition of 'kurai ondrum illai' has<br />moved me to tears, many a times.<br /><br />Nehru's words are the most befitting.<br /><br />Ã¢Â€Â˜Who am I before the queen of song?Ã¢Â€Â™<br /><br /><br />swetha</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Swetha;<br />I still have your "Ethanai Kodi Inbam kondai iraiva" after a group visit to<br />Thanjavur. This mail is as beautiful as that one.<br /><br />I would like share something about MS. My dad's maternal grandfather,<br />Narayana Iyer, had the largest and only hotel in Madurai called Dhinakara<br />Vilas. This hotel was the most famous hotel in Madurai(during that period)<br />and its southern villages.<br />MS, when she was a child, performed her first "kutcheri" (for the want of a<br />better word) for an important ceremony held by "Dhinakara Vilas" Narayana<br />Iyer. His wife, still alive (!), remembers this quite well. She should be<br />coming to Madurai, from Bangalore, sometime in May, maybe i'll ask her about<br />this in detail then.<br /><br />Just wanted to share this trivia with you people.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br />On Thu, Apr 10, 2008 at 12:35 PM, R.venketesh  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br />  enna swetha alayE kanOm?<br />  i remember you writing about MS long time back too.<br />  have you met her?<br />  venketesh<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Swetha" <br />  wrote: <br /> <br />   <br />    vanakkam,<br />   <br />    I have typed the first few words... then, I am lost in MS Amma&#39;s<br />  voice<br />    rendering &#39;vandaadum solai&#39;.

			<div class="content">Hi Swetha, nice to meet you and very nice article on<br />MSS, thanks <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />I havent met her, I have seen her, at a distance,<br />while I was young, in my teens. She used to stay with<br />my relative for concerts in and around Bangalore and<br />we would be allowed to 'visit' once in a while to<br />catch a glimpse of her. She reminded me often of my<br />athai, who was similar in character and temperment<br />although not a singer like her. Yes she was from a<br />different generation. The adjustments we make or even<br />our mothers make these days are nothing compared to<br />what these women did. To them their husbands were God,<br />a reputation that no man can live up to and many men<br />often took advantage of.<br /><br />Further if you study her story and background there<br />were many women similar (NC Vasanthakokilam for<br />example) who did not get to marry the right person,<br />their talents were lost to the world as nobody to<br />promote it like Sadasivam did for her.<br /><br />I would call her Meera, without hesitation. I would<br />not eulogise or idealise her marriage. Not only have<br />times changed but in all times men and women are human<br />beings, not God. To deify someone is not just lowering<br />one's own self respect, it is expecting too much of<br />the other person also.<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- Swetha  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>vanakkam,<br /> <br />  I have typed the first few words... then, I am lost<br />  in MS Amma&#39;s voice<br />  rendering &#39;vandaadum solai&#39;.
