Oh ..<br />wonderful characterisation ... not used to or bothered about the<br />social restrictions .. at the same time fully aware of herself and<br />the one with whom she is in love ...<br /><br />But both the Rulers (or R-designates) were hardly romantic .. and<br />Kalki was right .. they are fully burdened and not going to stop with<br />one Woman - for political reasons atleast ..<br /><br />Inspite of all these limitations, Vandiyathevan did initiate and<br />Kundavai did react as true lovers ..<br /><br />I think Kalki chose to portrait them so, since they got married<br />ultimately ...<br /><br />Regards / sps</div>

			<div class="content">As far as I have read kalki,the only woman who he has portrayed with<br />great qualities is kundavai.I dont mean that other female characters<br />portrayed by him are bad,but kundavai has many qualities which no<br />other character of his has.She dreams of empire building,governs a<br />country,does counter espoinage and finally plays a crucial role in<br />fame of chola empire.Had she ruled chola nadu instead of<br />arulmozi,she would have made a great queen.<br /><br />Sivakami is pushed to politics because of her affair with NV and the<br />infatuation naganadhi has on her.She too is the reason for building<br />of pallava empire,but again hers is a destructive power.She wants<br />revenge like nandini-she doesnt talk much about a great pallava<br />empire.She doesnt have dreams like kundavai had.<br /><br />Most other women like vanathi,manimegalai are replicas of heroines<br />of tamil movies of 1940's and 1950's.Poonguzali is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> odd,but<br />finally she too becomes traditional after marrying sendan amuthan.<br /><br />In other social novels of kalki the same traditional womenhood is<br />portrayed.In thiyaga boomi heroine throws away her husband and<br />becomes a freedom fighter,but even there she tries to live the<br />normal life of a housewife and only when its refused to her she<br />turns into a 'puratchi pen'.<br /><br />But whereas most of the male characters of kalki have megalomaniacal<br />dreams.vanthiya thevan,parthibendran,karikalan,arul mozi all have a<br />dream.Even pinagabani has a mega dream.People like<br />alwarkadiyan,anirudhar,naganandhi,paranjothi,parthiban,pazuvettarayar<br />all have a dream.All have a vision and come up fighting in their<br />lives.<br /><br />But maybe our women really lived like that in those days.Maybe kalki<br />portrayed the male dominant society as it existed then.<br /><br />I was reading udayar by balakumaran.He says that in chola empire<br />women worked as 'adikarachis' and even as guards.Kalki did not say<br />that.<br /><br />regards<br />sampath</div>

			<div class="content">I went to projectmadurai.com yesterday just to check<br />if there are any new files, and realized a funny<br />mistake I had made:<br />When I had downloaded <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> from the site a few months<br />back, there was no part 4. I did not know there was a<br />part 4, so after 3 parts, although the ending was<br />slightly abrupt, the novel overall was amazing, with a<br />tragic ending (not common in tamil lit.). Now I<br />realize there is part 4, so I am going to read it<br />today.

Oh, no offence, Vanathi is a nice <br />girl and all that - but I'm afraid as the consort of Arulmozhi, she isn't an <br />ideal heroine (I even remember feeling vaguely angry when Arulmozhi finally <br />confessed his 'love' for her, at the end - I felt kind of betrayed. <br />Arulmozhi...with this faint-heart!! Gah. Of course, I forced myself into <br />liking her, later. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />). But then, therein, I think, lies Kalki's superb <br />sense of proportion - he was well aware of how actual princesses of that era <br />behaved, and the tiny roles queens (the traditional ones, not people like <br />Princess Kundavai, who were very original in their views) - had to play, in <br />the running of Empires...which is why, I think, he portrayed Vanathi as the <br />'right girl'. Arulmozhi was not an ordinary prince, he would one day <br />establish an Empire - and to do that, he ought to have a docile, demure girl <br />who performs her duty well. (Can you see Poonghuzhali doing that? Like <br />holding a tempest in a tea-cup <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> I really like the girl...now *there's* <br />heroine material for you <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />That's what I like about Kalki - he's mostly realistic. <br />Now, to get back to Sivakami - a heroine, I'll admit, who has evoked rather <br />mixed reactions in me:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>1.Sivakaami&#39;s words and deeds hurt Maamallaa many a times.    <br />I think *all* heroines in love are capable of treating their beloved this</div></blockquote>way. Sivakami hurts him - because she's too much in love with him, and makes <br />the classic error of wanting most of his attention to herself. She's too <br />young, leads a secluded life tucked away in a forest, has practically no <br />friends, and lives in a fantasy world created by herself, with only a parrot <br />and a deer for company - and frankly, has too much time on her hands with <br />little to do but weave fantasies about herself and Maamallar. She's madly in <br />love with him, and when her fantasy world and reality colide, is left <br />confused, irritated, worried, and angry. Our normal heroines are guilty of <br />this - why not Sivakami, who's a sensitive soul? <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>2. Kalki himself could not resist describing the discomfort felt by <br />Maamalla by Sivakaami&#39;s behaviour.</div></blockquote>True. Maamallar feels discomfort - because he too is young, and <br />inexperienced, he's what...18, 20, in the first paagam? Way too young to <br />know a woman's heart. At that age, one is mostly aware of physical beauty - <br />and though Kalki has portrayed them as two people who genuinely fall for <br />each other because of their qualities, he also makes it clear that they find <br />each other very attractive. Maamallar was a Prince, his duty was defined to <br />him - and he had very little interaction with other young ladies his age - <br />in all probability, he had absolutely no idea of what Sivakami truly felt. <br />He tried to console her, and rest her fears...but he didn't really <br />understand her deep-seated fear that he might not marry her. To him, her <br />source of discomfort was not obvious. *He* was sure that he would marry her- <br />an event which did not happen, eventually. She was justified, don't you <br />think? <br />Added to that, Sivakami was rather temperamental in her ways...all creative <br />people are this way, to a certain extent. Maamallar, himself a fairly <br />matter-of-fact person, did not understand this very much, I think. <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>3.Sivakaami is a heroine having some elements of Nilaambari.     <br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41; I expect the stubbornness of her might give that impression. Not</div></blockquote>really. Sivakami was a typical woman, but none of her rages extended towards <br />actively bringing down that which she could not have. She spent hours <br />worrying about whether she would ever marry Maamallar - even though he was <br />in love with her, she was aware of the practical impossibilties of the <br />situation. The fact that Mahendra Pallavar opposed the match. And who could <br />go against the Emperor? Not even Maamallar would. All her raves and rants <br />were a result of this insecurity - but it did not go beyond that. She was <br />torn apart by emotions, but she could not take fate in her hands and *force* <br />a conclusion. <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>1.Sivakaami wanted a mommoth war to break out and the war to be led by <br />Maamalla. This is not entirely bcas of patriotism .</div></blockquote>Umm...does she? Want a war, ie? I doubt if she was sure of anything, at <br />that point. As I said in the above para, she was angry and worried - and she <br />spoke a few words too many. The war would break out regardless of what *she* <br />wanted ...all she really wanted was proof that Maamallar loved her. In <br />truth, she is horrified about the after-effects of it. In her heart of <br />hearts, she is aware that the war is not about her...though she would like <br />to believe it is. <br />*That* was truly the root of the problem. Ultimately, in the huge war <br />machinery, she's merely a rather useless...spare-part? <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>3.Sivakaami, at one time or other, creates problems for the main <br />characters - Maamallaa, Mahendraa, Paranjothi and Aayanar.</div></blockquote>If she didn't, then she would be as washed-out a character as Vanathi. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />) <br />She's talented, this woman - she's creative, she'a fantastic dancer, and she <br />has the power to draw crowds in. All the main characters respect her, love <br />her, esteem her according to their stations. They cannot help doing so - <br />for, she's a woman who cannot be ignored. Sivakami is the classic epic <br />heroine - a whirlwind who torments herself first and foremost, and others in <br />only a smaller measure. <br />She creates problems...? But she isn't the originator of those problems. To <br />Paranjyothi and Mahendra, she's the unresolved factor in a war - though they <br />like her very much and are afraid of causing her harm, ultimately she's an <br />object that has to kept safe. They are both concerned - which they would be, <br />even if she wasn't the lover of Mamaallar, she has intrinsic value as a <br />dancer - and she can't really help it. I can't think her responsible for the <br />'problems' created. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>4.Sivakaami doesn&#39;t seem to understand the regular royal obligations, a <br />prince will have.</div></blockquote>She does...but she's also a woman in love, who makes unusual demands of her <br />beloved. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Isn't that a fairly common symptom? She's far too young to know <br />and understand royal obligations - even so, she *tries* to. But she can't <br />keep consoling herself forever. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I have a question about Sivakaami. Is she not a cursed girl?   <br />Appar answers your question at the end of paagam one - she&#39;s much too</div></blockquote>talented, and msut face the ttrials of one with so much talent. In a way she <br />*is* cursed...but her existence is not just a curse. It's more than that. <br /><br />Argh. Too much Starwars - I'm still feeling the after- effects of Episode 3 <br />- and I keep drawing parallels with Anakin and Padme, and their doomed love <br />... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Which is a rather diluted version of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>, I think.

			<div class="content">Wow Pavithra... I think you covered pretty much everything that I wanted to <br />say but didnt have the time to type out. I agree completely. Sivakami is a <br />fantastic character because of the fact that she has all these <br />contradictions that natural, normal people have. She is not a poonguzhali <br />who can sacrifice her love or a Vanathi who is insipid and coy and in love. <br />This lady is her own woman. She knows her mind.. at least she thinks so. ALl <br />she wants is to marry Maamallan... she couldnt care two hoots about the <br />empire... She is also young and vain and foolish .. but again in love. <br />Normal people all behave like this.. and the genius of Kalki brought out all <br />these different facets.<br /><br />Although I have one slight quibble with Pavithra. She says that Maamallan <br />was too young to understnad the way a woman;s mind works. I want to ask her: <br />Is there any age where a man can claim to understand a womanÅ› mind? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 5/26/05, Pavithra Sri  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All...<br />   Have been following the <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> discussion &#40;what did you expect? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;&#41; with <br />  great interest. My two cents...<br />       I don&#39;t see Sivagami as an "egoist". I think of her as a girl with <br />  spunk, with individuality, with some attitude and oomph.

			<div class="content">Dear all...<br />      Wow Pavithra... I think you covered pretty much everything that I <br />wanted to say but didnt have the time to type out.   <br /> Thank you, doctor.  After having written all that out, I wondered <br />if I'd delivered an unreadable essay <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />) <br />    I agree completely. Sivakami is a fantastic character because of the <br />fact that she has all these contradictions that natural, normal people have. <br />She is not a poonguzhali who can sacrifice her love or a Vanathi who is <br />insipid and coy and in love.    <br /> Now *that* is a point. Sivakami differs from V and P in the fact that she <br />possesses what's seen as a true 'gift' - she is therefore independent, and <br />is perfectly aware of it. The other two aren't so, except perhaps <br />Poonguzhali, who's fierecely independent without being particularly gifted <br />(except in rowing, perhaps <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />. That shows Poo's character-development...but <br />Vanathi...urgh.<br /> I wonder what Kundavai really thought. Perhaps she wished Arulmozhi to have <br />a demure wife, who wouldn't really interfere in matters of state - and pose <br />a threat to her? A brother who's used to an intelligent sister is one <br />thing...but a wife who's equally intelligent? Hmm. <br />      Although I have one slight quibble with Pavithra. She says that <br />Maamallan was too young to understnad the way a woman;s mind works. I want <br />to ask her: Is there any age where a man can claim to understand a womanÅ› <br />mind? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />        <br /> Why aren't there any icons to indicate mad grins? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />)))))))))<br /> I doubt if any man really does [Standard Disclaimer: there are always <br />exceptions <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />]. It seems to take them *years*. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />)) Women adopt a <br />convoluted way of thinking sometimes - their thought processes go at the <br />speed of light - she's probably thinking 10 years into the future, while a <br />man's wondering what he'll get for his next meal. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />))).
