His major<br />mass movements are in 1920, 1930 and 1942. If you see in between years, you<br />would notice that Gandhi would have gone on pause mode. The main reason<br />being freedom movement was not having MASS SUPPORT as reported in many of<br />the articles. It is confined only to Major cities, towns, educated class<br />etc., Just apply common sense. Population of United India at that time was<br />30 crores. Did 10% of this population took part in all of the freedom<br />struggle ? Cannot be. Practically also it is not possible. But, Gandhi's<br />freedom movements did make a big impact many of the Indian masses (unlike<br />other congress leaders who did not understand the pulse of the problem).<br />Whether Gandhi's propaganda of Grama munnetram, kaiththozil, etc., will<br />take us forward ?<br /><br />8) medicos problem - oru varusham graamaththila poi sevai pannungannu sonnaa<br />poraattaththila kudhikkiraanga. (I do not really know the gravity of the<br />problem; but the media is not allowing people to really understand both<br />sides of the issues).<br />9) See the amount of money poured into IITs by Governments; as a matter of<br />fact in all premium institutions. Let us all be honest (including myself)<br />whether we have done justice to this. What will be the cost of education (of<br />similar standards in overseas) and what we have actually paid ? Whether we<br />are returning back to the nation ?<br />We are ready to do service to the nation but there are lot of corruption,<br />bureaucracy, etc., nu jalli adikkaatheenga. Intha negative points ulla<br />nation thaan, intha inefficient government thaan majority of the educated<br />class uruvaavadharku responsible enbathai naam maranthu vidakkoodaathu.<br /><br />Ippadi negative points eththanaiyoo irundhaalum, we have lot to cheer about<br />in the positive aspects. But none of the media is honestly putting efforts<br />in this direction. (including this forum).<br /><br />The bottom line is "let us facts as facts". As Venkatesh rightly pointed out<br />"pushing the rubbish under the carpet does not mean everything is clean and<br />rosy".<br />We still have negatives and only thing that is making us moving forward is<br />not patriotism, i repeat it is not patriotism it is purely survival of the<br />fittest.<br /><br />Once I read an article by Sujatha. Soldiers in the warfront do have<br />different set of mindset when they are in distress. When a co-soldier is<br />killed by an enemy gunshot, a soldier is not fired up by patriotism it is<br />his acquaintance with the co-soldier that drives the soldier to take<br />revenge. I agree to this theory.<br /><br />Anbudan<br /><br />B.Muruganantham<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />[mailto: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->]On Behalf Of R.venketesh<br />Sent: Monday, November 26, 2007 6:40 AM<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence India<br /><br /><br />Hi ravi<br />it would be a great conversation if you dont keep dropping words like<br />supporters of british or singing the british lullaby or slave to the<br />white skin.<br /><br />the british left india sixty years back and you have such strong<br />feelings on racism.

We have<br />to<br />  be proud of ourselves... cant argue with that...<br />    I dont deny that exists even today...but still people speak out<br />and<br />  are outraged I am sure we all know of stephen lawrence case which<br />is<br />  still supported by locals...<br />   <br />    Come on I and vijay can choose the British PM just because i<br />lived<br />  in a counytry once ruled by the crown Yes a valid resident of<br />  commonwealth has voting rights in England<br />   <br />    We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even<br />  today I get asked &#39;&#39;Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi<br />  sakthi??&#39;&#39; Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and<br />  yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the<br />  dissections. ..<br />   <br />    We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till<br />  he was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a<br />train<br />  in south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />    Do you know the support he had from the average white man in<br />  England because he was changing humanity and people recognised it<br />    You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man<br />   <br />    You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem<br />  issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the<br />  third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French<br />  and English history might be different<br />   <br />    I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight<br />  not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them<br />had<br />  a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month &#40;the custom<br />is<br />  virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer<br />  so...&#41;one of them was able to make a crown out of it....<br />   <br />    Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the<br />  nobels had the right of PrimaNocte.. .spending the first night with<br />  all their subjects was their right.<br />   <br />    Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians<br />who<br />  were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all<br />those<br />  ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!<br />   <br />    Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he<br />  needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in<br />  Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because<br />they<br />  were victorious but they kept their word.<br />   <br />    The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in<br />  Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened<br />   <br />    The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two<br />  old fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a<br />  country already tiorn by a partition...

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />There is a book by Dharampal called 'Beautiful tree'. It is an<br />online book from the website 'www.dharampal.net.' This book shows the<br />picture of Indian society in 18th century during the beginning of<br />british rule. This book is an eye opener to me and it changed many of<br />my views about british rule. It also helps me to understand the<br />lifestyle, characters and living conditions of our ancestors 200yrs<br />back and I no longer think of them as docile people who surrendered to<br />the foreign invasion without much fight. This book is relevant to this<br />current topic in discussion.I would like to know if any of you had<br />read this book and what is its impact on your opinion about India<br />under british rule.<br /><br />Ananth</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Venkat,<br /><br />There is no odd notion here. And you have also been attaching an emotional outcry without attempting to understand or completely read what I had mentioned. And I do not need lessons to patriotism either. Your grasp on my words as usual have been an impatient gesture to contradict what is said. Thats how you got to 'derive' some odd statement that Aurangazeb rule was better.... I am thinking how complex of a theorem you had to build to come into that conclusion through multiple iterations...<br /><br />Aurangazeb did gross injustice,then Shivaji happened, but that was not a national fight...yet, before it got there...aurangazeb left the planet. Aurangazeb had to struggle for every inch of land he conquered. By the time he touched the Deccan plateau he was drowning. He ruled less than 1/4th of what is today's mainland india. He ruled for 48 years of which the second half was spent in the deccan losing to Shivaji. Aurangazeb is not the context of discussion but british are. Aurangazeb is a whole different story all together.<br /><br />As you pointed out, I do live in the west and I am not sure what that has to do with thoughts on India. In the US, you are free to criticize anything you want, their iraq war, their foreign policies etc... but I am yet to see any critic on their freedom fighters. Please do not say US does not have issues...<br /><br />I have been insisting that our democracy - dharma - is the way of life. I had quoted places from the Gita and other practices, in all essence there should be quite a lot for you to splits i guess <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Travancore Dewan: <br />And again, why would you mix two entities into one common port , seshaya shastry - one of the sponsors of Ravi Varma and Seshaya shastry the british appointed dewan of travancore...every coin has another side is what I say, I for one, do not want to believe what a british appointed dewan wrote, without researching more into it.<br /><br />Patriotism is key to bringing forward a country, the sense of my country, my people is key for us to build a stronger country. A soldier needs to look at his dead peer to feel the adrenaline and seek revenge, but he needs patriotism to be at the war front in the first place. A non patriotic soldier is no use for his peers or his country.<br /><br />Covering up under the rug is the accusation, in a family if there are situations where there is a problem child, we try to rectify it in our home, not seek help from thugs. Post independance india has issues, too many issues, we are breathing free <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>after a long time, it takes time and cycles to settle down. What is the point in analyzing history if we do not learn from it. Ridiculing almost all of our freedom struggle attempts are not for my favor at anytime.<br /><br />Gandi's movement: <br />Yes there were periods of gaps in Gandhi's movements as pointed out by Muruganandam... however he also points that..Gandhi worked during pauses to collect mass support. I dont think any of us here were witness to the freedom stuggle and to go by logic on 10% support of 30 cr may not be a right number. There may have been atleast more than 20% of people like myself or some others... The world knew of a great man in Gandhi, he taught the world a lot, even if there are people who are critics of Gandhi the man, the mahatma had done a lot for not just India but for the whole world...and was rightly called the mahatma.. You all have read great books written by many authors for your wide knowledge, I would humbly request a read of Gandhi's Gita. Only a person of great and vast knowledge and ...spiritually evolved, can write so.<br /><br />I would be lying if I say I am not emotional and cold on facts only, agreed. I do not know how many others feel same way, every topic other than national sentiments can be debated upon with a balanced view, this is something that needs a dash of color to it. Every one is entitled to their own views on religion, language or any subject. Forsome reason, I feel the whole issue of freedom is bound to have emotions attached for simple people such as me. Nothing personal against venkat or sridhar but freedom struggle is definitely an emotional one for me.<br /><br />In the movie, Gandhi.. there is a statement at last when the general points out that without the british there will be so many indias inside india... for which members of our first congress replies that it would not be britain's problem to deal with but ours. I stand by that. I always will.<br /><br />Again, there is nothing to say, the discussion became pointless, when freedom fighters and their cause is thrown to depths. Respecting and honoring our statesmen is the very least we can do to appreciate what they did. Finally, the catalyst for english lullaby started from the note on 'your freedom fighters', rightly it should have atleast been...i say again, atleast it should have been 'our freedom fighters'.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: R.venketesh <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2007 8:10:27 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence India<br /><br />Hi ravi<br />it would be a great conversation if you dont keep dropping words like<br />supporters of british or singing the british lullaby or slave to the<br />white skin.<br /><br />the british left india sixty years back and you have such strong<br />feelings on racism.

It is an<br />online book from the website 'www.dharampal. net.' This book shows the<br />picture of Indian society in 18th century during the beginning of<br />british rule. This book is an eye opener to me and it changed many of<br />my views about british rule. It also helps me to understand the<br />lifestyle, characters and living conditions of our ancestors 200yrs<br />back and I no longer think of them as docile people who surrendered to<br />the foreign invasion without much fight. This book is relevant to this<br />current topic in discussion.I would like to know if any of you had<br />read this book and what is its impact on your opinion about India<br />under british rule.<br /><br />Ananth</div>

			<div class="content">I dont think this argument is going anywhere. But I feel Sri and <br />Venkat refuses to accept the ill's the british has left back.<br /><br />I clearly said - British rule is like giving a pot full of rice to a <br />hungry person with a drop of poison in it. Simple, loud and clear.<br /><br />A small drop in a potfull might not kill the person, but surely will <br />have some side effects, and ofcourse ill effects. Thats what British <br />rule has led us to.<br /><br />I didnt get any impression from Ravi's mail that he was supporting <br />Aurangzeb's rule to British rule. I wonder whether I got it wrong of <br />Venkat got it wrong, and why should I be questioned for this. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Venkat was the one who told me (taught me) that for almost 80 years <br />of Muslim rule in Madurai there were no Hindu celebrations. Later I <br />learnt it when I read 'Thiruvarangan Ula'. For nearly 5 century's <br />Bhrath was plundered by muslim invasion and the foundations of <br />sanathana dharma was shaken. Then came Sivaji to rebuild the Hindu <br />nation. From a gross adharma of Aurangzeb's rule, we did get some <br />good, a concept of Hindu liberty. But what did we get out of British <br />rule, apart from Indian Railways and the corrupted adminstrative <br />system. Thats whay I meant by 'a potful of rice with a drop of <br />poison'. A evil in the disguise of good.<br /><br />When Sri and Venkat say that we should look at our ills, I am asking <br />them, why dont you look at the goods we had? I strongly feel that <br />taking a balanced look at of our goods and bads and taking the good <br />and leaving the bad behind is the path to success. Pondering over <br />the bads alone will take us no where. you are saying the glass i <br />half empty, people like me and Ravi say the glass is half full. Same <br />points in different perspective.<br /><br />What has happened has happened. We cant change it. But we should <br />admit that amidst a few good, the British has done a lot of harm to <br />us. Material development can be achived only if we have a strong <br />minds. British gave us material development but ruined our thought <br />process. Thats a hard fact which everyone should accept.<br /><br />Saying that without english (meaning without British coming to <br />India), we could not have become global IT power, is baseless. What <br />about China? They are equally good. Only problem they have is lack <br />of English. Now they have realized it and started learning english. <br />In next 10 years, they will also be good in English. Its a matter of <br />time. If we were not talking english, we would have in next 10 <br />years. Matter of time. compulsion of time. No one can go against it. <br />Just for giving english knowledge, we should not say British did a <br />lot of good to us. They did equal amount of good and equal amount of <br />bad. But the bad's have a long lasting impact than the good they <br />did. Lets accept it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-<br />  Hi<br />  I should ask sathish mainly if he agrees with it.so we gladly <br />kept <br />  watching when aurangazeb knocked off a few thousand hindu temples</div></blockquote></div>
