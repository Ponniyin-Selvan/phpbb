			<div class="content">//I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people say <br />that this group is not the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. <br />This is certainly in our groups purview. When we say we are trying to <br />protect our culture and history, is this not a big hit to our <br />culture?//<br /><br />I agree with you Satish. There should have been some protests. But <br />nothing. Why? Tamilian's backbone is already broken.<br /><br />When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and made our <br />goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not protest.<br /><br />When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during vinayakar <br />chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.<br /><br />When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed inside the <br />sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.<br /><br />When governments murdered their citizens in the name of religion, we <br />didnt have guts to raise the voice.<br /><br />When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva vazhipaadu, <br />we least bothered about that.<br /><br />When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />political tit-for-tat.<br /><br />When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, we <br />tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.<br /><br />Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures to react only for <br />this? Just because we are programmed to attribute bad things to DMK <br />and find faults only in Dravidian parties?<br /><br />Regards<br />A.Kumaraguruparan<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>anaivarukkum iniya puthandu vazhthukkal.......<br />  <br />  Hope the new year sees many more great events in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group... <br />wishing good luck to all the <br />  new plans that we have ahead....<br />  <br />  Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />talking with my friend in <br />  Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new <br />year. The happenings in <br />  TN disturbed me....<br />  <br />  This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and even <br />the moderators might be <br />  requested to delete this posting......<br />  <br />  I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the new <br />year is only 2 or 3 <br />  compared to the previous years...Hope people got me where I am <br />coming to....<br />  <br />  THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to celebrate <br />Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />  yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />  intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from a <br />few. I was shocked to hear <br />  from my friend that all tv channels say &#39;chitirai tirunal <br />vazhthukkal&#39; &#40;as did one of our <br />  member&#41; and not puthandu vazhtukkal..<br />  <br />  I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people say <br />that this group is not <br />  the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly in <br />our groups purview.

I talked <br />with my friend around <br />  1.30 in the night &#40;my time&#41; and i could not sleep further. <br />Wondering where the country is <br />  heading.. <br />  <br />  Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even a <br />mention of this in our <br />  group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the new <br />year. If tanjai periya <br />  koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />saying that its a hit for our <br />  culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?<br />  <br />  who gave these people such authority to change religious things as <br />they wish. Will these <br />  people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam eout <br />of India we should not <br />  follow that calendar? <br />  <br />  Ravi, <br />  <br />  I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />mythology. I used to think in <br />  those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel <br />these are also mini <br />  pralaya&#39;s where the dharma is being disturbed. <br />  <br />  If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />caveat of creamy layer, our <br />  so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit <br />the criteria for creamy <br />  layer..<br />  <br />  <br />  For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state and <br />the country, say that <br />  without these people their community could not have improved, I <br />like to quote Swami <br />  Chinmayananda,<br />  <br />  &#39;The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they could <br />have done better, if the <br />  situations were different&#39;.<br />  <br />  How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will be <br />bashing the hindu and <br />  their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but who <br />the hell are they to say <br />  that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? <br />  <br />  Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not on <br />the streets. <br />  <br />  Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />should be written in this <br />  group. As rightly pointed out by Arun &#40;is that Arun? &#41; we try to <br />brush things under the <br />  carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and <br />gain and spread knowledge <br />  about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion <br />theory is a myth, we still <br />  stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.<br />  <br />  And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and <br />preserve culture, but dont <br />  spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br />  <br />  Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from others <br />perspective, this mail is <br />  surely not related this group.<br />  <br />  God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Members,<br /><br />When the TN Government announced that the tamil New Year begins from <br />Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is already 3 month <br />old) Where is the question of protesting that now?<br /><br />When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass viewership also <br />used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that we can also record <br />our views here and be done with it ...<br /><br /><br />Since the topic is discussed my view is : <br /><br />SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..<br /><br />IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH too.<br /><br />This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.<br /><br />When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS occur ?<br />who did ? when commenced ?<br />How commended from Chithirai ?<br /><br />Why TN Government is telling this to be computed from " Thai" ?<br /><br />With these concrete points made available for discussion we can put <br />forward our views .. instead of mentioning specific names / <br />parties / races.<br /><br />Vaazhthukkal,<br /><br />sps <br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "akumarg1976" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>//I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move.

There should have been some protests. But <br />  nothing. Why? Tamilian&#39;s backbone is already broken.<br />  <br />  When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and made <br />our <br />  goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not protest.<br />  <br />  When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during vinayakar <br />  chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.<br />  <br />  When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed inside <br />the <br />  sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.<br />  <br />  When governments murdered their citizens in the name of religion, <br />we <br />  didnt have guts to raise the voice.<br />  <br />  When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva <br />vazhipaadu, <br />  we least bothered about that.<br />  <br />  When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />  political tit-for-tat.<br />  <br />  When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, we <br />  tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.<br />  <br />  Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures to react only for <br />  this? Just because we are programmed to attribute bad things to <br />DMK <br />  and find faults only in Dravidian parties?<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  A.Kumaraguruparan<br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    anaivarukkum iniya puthandu vazhthukkal.......<br />    <br />    Hope the new year sees many more great events in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group... <br />  wishing good luck to all the <br />    new plans that we have ahead....<br />    <br />    Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />  talking with my friend in <br />    Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new <br />  year.

Its ATROCIOUS to <br />    intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from <br />a <br />  few. I was shocked to hear <br />    from my friend that all tv channels say &#39;chitirai tirunal <br />  vazhthukkal&#39; &#40;as did one of our <br />    member&#41; and not puthandu vazhtukkal..<br />    <br />    I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people <br />say <br />  that this group is not <br />    the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly <br />in <br />  our groups purview. When we <br />    say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this <br />not a <br />  big hit to our culture?<br />    <br />    &#39;Nenju porukudhillaye..intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />  vittaal&#39;..beautiful words of <br />    Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />have <br />  the back bone to fight <br />    against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />talked <br />  with my friend around <br />    1.30 in the night &#40;my time&#41; and i could not sleep further. <br />  Wondering where the country is <br />    heading.. <br />    <br />    Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even <br />a <br />  mention of this in our <br />    group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the <br />new <br />  year. If tanjai periya <br />    koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />  saying that its a hit for our <br />    culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?<br />    <br />    who gave these people such authority to change religious things <br />as <br />  they wish. Will these <br />    people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam <br />eout <br />  of India we should not <br />    follow that calendar? <br />    <br />    Ravi, <br />    <br />    I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />  mythology. I used to think in <br />    those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel <br />  these are also mini <br />    pralaya&#39;s where the dharma is being disturbed. <br />    <br />    If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />  caveat of creamy layer, our <br />    so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit <br />  the criteria for creamy <br />    layer..<br />    <br />    <br />    For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state <br />and <br />  the country, say that <br />    without these people their community could not have improved, I <br />  like to quote Swami <br />    Chinmayananda,<br />    <br />    &#39;The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />could <br />  have done better, if the <br />    situations were different&#39;.<br />    <br />    How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will <br />be <br />  bashing the hindu and <br />    their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but <br />who <br />  the hell are they to say <br />    that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? <br />    <br />    Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not <br />on <br />  the streets. <br />    <br />    Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />  should be written in this <br />    group. As rightly pointed out by Arun &#40;is that Arun? &#41; we try to <br />  brush things under the <br />    carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and <br />  gain and spread knowledge <br />    about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion <br />  theory is a myth, we still <br />    stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.<br />    <br />    And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and <br />  preserve culture, but dont <br />    spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br />    <br />    Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from <br />others <br />  perspective, this mail is <br />    surely not related this group.<br />    <br />    God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">The question is not just changing the new year from chitirai 1 to thai<br />1. I too read about it a few months back. These are obvious political<br />stunts and people are not bothered about it. Even now, the whole state<br />will be celebrating the new year only on chitirai 1 and not on thai 1. <br /><br />But I got wild when I heard that the panchangam reading was banned in<br />the temples. This is what I called atrocious.<br /><br />Reposting my question - 'if the govt. is so strong in celebrating only<br />thai 1 as new year and can ban panchangam reading in temples on<br />chitirai 1, can the pass an order to stop the new prayers in the<br />churches on Jan 1?'<br /><br />My protest was only for the religious intervention of the state when<br />they call themselves secular. Secular actually means govt. keeping<br />away from religion and not treating all religion equal. Forget equal<br />treatment, in India seulcar alwasy means pro-minority...<br /><br />Yes, our backbone has been broken long ago and only god can save this<br />country.<br /><br />Remembering Tirumoolars word - 'iruttai iruttaki azhippan'.
