			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />I guess I should put mu tuppence worth in. I agree that what Ramadoss and co <br />are doing is taking things to an extreme. However, I also feel that the <br />level of spoke Tamizh has deteriorated remarkably, especially among the <br />English educated folks. This needs to be corrected. I am so ashamed when I <br />hear a Bengali or someone from UP speak their respective languages, with <br />nary a word of English thrown in. But watch a couple of tamilians speak, and <br />it is rather appalling. Just for kicks, check out some programs on Sun TV <br />(let's say the news) and watch a couple of Tamilians give their views. And <br />for contrast watch a couple of Northern people speak Hindi and you can see <br />the stark difference. What amazes me is this. People feel ashamed to make <br />even simple grammatical errors while speaking English. But they appear to <br />have absolutely no problems making all sorts of errors while speaking <br />Tamizh. Why is this the case?<br /><br /><br />As my own small effort towards correcting this tendency, I have started a <br />yahoo group called Tamizhvalarchchi where I send out a word-a-day (Dinamoru <br />Tamizhchchol). You can access it at <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br /><br />Yes, we ought not to take it to extremes, but we ought to be able to speak <br />our mothertongues well. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />On 4/14/05, narendran_g2000  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Sampath,<br />  <br />  Personal attacks apart, I think you are trying to twist facts. No one<br />  is trying to ban other art forms. trying to promote Tamil music is not<br />  banning Carnatic music. If Tamils in Tamilnadu cannot promote Tamil<br />  music then who else would?.<br />  <br />  What&#39;s the necessity to name tamil movies in english words, and using<br />  english words in tamil songs. As i said earlier &#40;maybe in<br />  "maraththadi"&#41; movies and music is the only link now between<br />  youngsters in TN with tamil. what&#39;s the need for naming a movie "New"<br />  and songs like "suppose unnai kaathalichu..."?? I don&#39;t think many<br />  people are into tamil novels / magazines..<br />  <br />  No one is against scientific development. We should all welcome it,<br />  but at the sametime make sure the language grows too.. "kanippori" is<br />  a new Tamil word coined and gained enough currency.<br />  <br />  No one is against sanskrit either. Last month I was in a temple in<br />  pittsburgh. The priest &#40;i believe a non-tamil&#41; was chanting "pallaandu<br />  pallaandu pallayirathaandu.. ". It was nice to hear that. don&#39;t know<br />  that priest knew the meaning, but i was able to comprehend.. If you<br />  communicate in a language you know you can immediately connect.. With<br />  thousands of religious songs in tamil, It would be a common-sense<br />  thing to use tamil in prayers.<br />  <br />  Even for a non-religious person like me, hearing devotional songs that<br />  I understand makes sense..

			<div class="content">As an addendum.. someone mentioned Carnatic Music.. For me personally, I <br />tend to listen more to instrumental Carnatic rather than vocal (unless it is <br />Nithyashree Mahadevan). Then again, I realized that one of the reasons for <br />that might be that all the Thyagaraj Keertanais are in Telugu and I can't <br />really understand those. However, I also realized that I enjoyed Bharathiyar <br />compositions immensely, and then it dawned on me that maybe its the <br />language.. I like listening to what I understand. In a way, instrumental <br />music takes the language variable out of the equation.. but sometimes the <br />beauty of the words is lost. So yeah, hearing something in a language one <br />understands CAN make a difference.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />On 4/14/05, Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All,<br />  <br />  I guess I should put mu tuppence worth in.

I am so ashamed when I <br />  hear a Bengali or someone from UP speak their respective languages, with <br />  nary a word of English thrown in. But watch a couple of tamilians speak, and <br />  it is rather appalling. Just for kicks, check out some programs on Sun TV <br />  &#40;let&#39;s say the news&#41; and watch a couple of Tamilians give their views. And <br />  for contrast watch a couple of Northern people speak Hindi and you can see <br />  the stark difference. What amazes me is this. People feel ashamed to make <br />  even simple grammatical errors while speaking English. But they appear to <br />  have absolutely no problems making all sorts of errors while speaking <br />  Tamizh. Why is this the case?<br />  <br />  <br />  As my own small effort towards correcting this tendency, I have started a <br />  yahoo group called Tamizhvalarchchi where I send out a word-a-day &#40;Dinamoru <br />  Tamizhchchol&#41;. You can access it at <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi</a><!-- m -->.<br />  <br />  <br />  Yes, we ought not to take it to extremes, but we ought to be able to speak <br />  our mothertongues well. <br />  <br />  Cheers,<br />  <br />  Arun<br />  <br />  <br />  On 4/14/05, narendran_g2000  wrote:<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Sampath,<br />    <br />    Personal attacks apart, I think you are trying to twist facts. No one<br />    is trying to ban other art forms. trying to promote Tamil music is not<br />    banning Carnatic music. If Tamils in Tamilnadu cannot promote Tamil <br />    music then who else would?.<br />    <br />    What&#39;s the necessity to name tamil movies in english words, and using<br />    english words in tamil songs. As i said earlier &#40;maybe in<br />    "maraththadi"&#41; movies and music is the only link now between <br />    youngsters in TN with tamil. what&#39;s the need for naming a movie "New"<br />    and songs like "suppose unnai kaathalichu..."?? I don&#39;t think many<br />    people are into tamil novels / magazines..<br />    <br />    No one is against scientific development. We should all welcome it, <br />    but at the sametime make sure the language grows too.. "kanippori" is<br />    a new Tamil word coined and gained enough currency.<br />    <br />    No one is against sanskrit either. Last month I was in a temple in<br />    pittsburgh. The priest &#40;i believe a non-tamil&#41; was chanting "pallaandu <br />    pallaandu pallayirathaandu.. ". It was nice to hear that. don&#39;t know<br />    that priest knew the meaning, but i was able to comprehend.. If you<br />    communicate in a language you know you can immediately connect.. With <br />    thousands of religious songs in tamil, It would be a common-sense<br />    thing to use tamil in prayers.<br />    <br />    Even for a non-religious person like me, hearing devotional songs that<br />    I understand makes sense.. I believe you are passionate about <br />    religion. Common sense dictates that you should be in the forefront to<br />    lead this to cultivate interest in the people..<br />    <br />    Thanks,<br />    Naren.<br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "rojatraders"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      narendran,<br />     <br />      what is the objective of this agitation?<br />     <br />      1.stop using sanskrit,english words<br />      2.name  yourself in tamil.<br />     <br />      English borrows many words from all over the<br />      world.They recently have added words like karma,deepawali and Ganesh<br />      to their dictionary.check it out in dictionary.com.Did any english<br />      man protest when these words were inlcuded? <br />     <br />      and asking firms to name themselves in tamil is<br />      utter foolishness.For example chettinad cement,its a tamilian<br />      company.If it names itself as "chettinadu kalavai tholichalai" no<br />      body outside tamilnadu will know what business it is in. <br />     <br />      also for many sanskrit words there arent equal tamil<br />      words.For example amaichar.mandhiri both are sanskrit words.There is<br />      no equilant word in tamil to it.Also daily thousands of inventions<br />      are patented all over the world.Translating all of them into tamil<br />      is impossible.<br />     <br />      This will destroy tamilians totally.Language is a<br />      tool for human improvement.But these people make out as if people<br />      are a tool to language improvement.<br />     <br />      also preerving tamil music and arts is a good<br />      joke.Music and arts have no linguistic barriers.Americans enjoy<br />      music all over the world-including african bancho music.good arts<br />      and music have to be enjoyed regardless of language. <br />     <br />      we can say karagattam is great,oyilattam is great<br />      etc.Fine,but western jazz and rap are better than that.whats wrong<br />      in enjoying it?saying i will revive tamil music is also humbug.our<br />      nattupura padals are ok,but there are better forms of music than <br />      that.Let people who want to hear them,hear them.Threatening singers<br />      and poets to use only tamil is cultural fascism.<br />     <br />      Let some great musician compose great tune in<br />      tamil.People all over the world will enjoy it without bothering<br />      which language its coming from.Change oyilattam,karagattam to some<br />      great artistic form and it will be liked all over the world.If<br />      anybody has that creativity and interest let them do so.But stopping<br />      other languages and saying listening to karnatic and english music<br />      is anti-tamil is meaningless to say the least.<br />      <br />      Tamil has to compete and grow.It cannot ban<br />      others and grow.If it happens tamilians will go back by thousands of<br />      years.<br />     <br />      regards<br />      sampath<br />     <br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "narendran_g2000"<br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        Hello Prasanna,<br />       <br />        Karunanithi has never said his grandson knew Hindi and that&#39;s the <br />        reason for his cabinet post..
