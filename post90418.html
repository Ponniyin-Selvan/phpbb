			<div class="content">6.

Names%20of</a><!-- m -->%<br />20Maldives.pdf<br /><br /><br />Given below are some of the names by which Maldives was known <br />through the centuries.<br />1. The earliest known reference to Maldives is given in the <br />Mahavansa, the ancient<br />chronicle of the people of Sri Lanka, written in c. 200 BC. In these <br />records Maldives<br />is referred to as Mahinda-dvipa.<br />2. About the fourth century AD, Palladius, Bishop of Hellenopolis <br />(360-430 AD) a<br />classical Greek bishop, refers to Maldives as Maniolae, in his <br />document "On the<br />Races of the Indian and the Brahmans", adding that the magnet stone <br />which attracts<br />iron was produced in these islands.<br />3. In ancient South Indian Pallava Dynasty inscriptions of the 7th <br />century AD, Maldives<br />were called Dvipa Laksham (a hundred thousand islands).<br />4. Hsuan Tsang, a Buddhist monk who travelled in India for religious <br />studies in the<br />years 629 to 645 AD, was the first Chinese writer to mention <br />Maldives. He called the<br />islands Na-lo-ki-lo-chou (coconut islands).<br />5. A Chinese document from the Tang Dynasty, records the visit of <br />Maldivians to China<br />bringing with them gifts from their king, Baladitiya in 658 AD and <br />also in 662 AD.<br />Maldives is referred to as Mo-lai in this document.<br />6. In a 10th century South Indian record of the Chola Dynasty, <br />Maldives is given the<br />name Munnir Palantivu Pannirayiram (twelve thousand islands and the <br />ocean where<br />three waters meet).<br />7. Sulaiman was a Persian merchant and sea-captain who lived in the <br />first half of the<br />ninth century AD. His manuscripts describing his travels and the <br />places he visited<br />were found in France in the 1700's. In his description of Maldives, <br />he gives them the<br />name Dibajat. Al Biruni in the 11th century and Al Idrisi in the <br />12th century AD, also<br />referred to Maldives by the name of Dibajat.<br />8. Abu Zayd, who lived in Iraq in the years 850 to 934 AD, writes of <br />Maldives as Dyvah<br />Kouzah (cowrie islands).<br />9. In the Tamil commentary Tolkattiyam of the 13th century AD, <br />Maldives is called<br />Palpalamtivu (many old islands).<br />10. A Chinese writer Wang Ta-Yuan, writing in 1349, gave the <br />Maldives the name Pei<br />Liu. In 1414 AD, Cheng Ho the famous Chinese commander came to <br />Maldives,<br />bringing with him a scribe by the name of Ma Huan, to record their <br />travels. In Ma<br />Huan's records Maldives is called Liu Shan Tieh-<acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> (the countries <br />of the island<br />mountains). In 1436 AD, another Chinese writer Fei Hsin called the <br />islands, Liu Shan<br />Yang (atolls of Maldives).<br />11. The 13th century Kudahuvadhoo Loamaafaanu give Maldives' name as<br />"Panandheepu". The Bodugalu Miskiiy Loamaafaanu gives the same name <br />as<br />"Fanandheebu".<br />12. Ibn Batuta who visited Maldives in 1343 and stayed for 18 <br />months, and returned in<br />1346 AD, called the islands by the name, Dhibat Al Mahal.<br />13. When the first Portuguese arrived in the East in the early 16th <br />century, Maldives was<br />referred to by them as Ilha Dywe.<br />14. In1573 AD, when Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-Auzam became Sultan <br />after the<br />defeat of the Portuguese, he gave the country the official name of <br />Al Daulat min al-<br />Mahaldibiyat.<br />15. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Maldives was called <br />Maldiva Islands in many<br />English records, but by the beginning of the 20th century, Maldives <br />or Maldive Islands<br />had become the commonly used name.</div>

			<div class="content">hi rahul<br /><br />our archives have again revealed a gem..mssg # 4220. most of what we <br />discussed has already presented....beautiful work and some <br />intersting questions<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "ratnasabapathy_srihari" <br /> wrote: <br /><br /><br />References to and the location of Palanthivukal: <br /><br />Among the near overseas territories conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1<br />{A.D.985-1014} and Rajendra Chola - 1{A.D.1012-1044} other than Sri <br />Lanka and Saanthimaththivu, were the "Palanthivukal". They are <br />presently referred to, partly as Maldive Islands coming under <br />separate rule, and partly as Laccadive Islands (Lakshadweep) coming <br />under the rule of mainland India.<br /><br />Rajaraja's conquer of "Palanthivukal", is refered to in his <br />Meikeerthi in Tamil as "Munneer Palanthivu Panneer ayiram" meaning <br />the "old islands tweleve thousand of the sea".<br /><br />Rajendra's conquer of "Palanthivukal" is refered to as "Sangathir <br />velaith thol perung kaaval pal Palanthivum" in Tamil in his <br />Meikeerthi meaning the "ancient many old islands with waves  <br />resounding conches and having strong guard" <br /><br />The first mention of this place name - namely the "Palanthivukal" <br />meaning "Old Islands" in Tamil Â– is found in an early Tamil Grammer <br />Work known as "Akaththiyar Vaakku", quoted in another 12th Century <br />Tamil Grammer Work known as the "Nannool" by one of it's commentator <br />named the Mayilainathar.<br /><br />This reference to "Palanthivukal" is found in a group of regional <br />names given in "Akaththiyar Vaakku" as the other countries where <br />Tamil was spoken, which is as follows: <br /><br />"Kanni then karai ka(da)t Palan thivam, Singalam, KollamÂ…Â…..palaku <br />Thamil thiri nilangalum mudiyudai moovarum idu nila aatchi"<br /><br />Nannol Â– Page 272 Mayilainather Urai - U.V.Saminatha Iyer <br />Publication <br />(Also refer Tholkaappiam Â– Sollathikaram, Theiva Sillaiyar <br />commentry)  <br /><br />From: the above it is noted that the approximate location of <br />Palanthivukal was in the south of the Kanni the region of <br />Kanyakumari, of TamilNadu State, South India.  <br /><br />The exact location of these Palanthivukal could be further gleaned <br />from the writings of a Portugese Traveller named "Duarte Barbosa" of <br />the early `seventeenth century' to the Indian Archipelago.<br /><br />"Opposite this country of Malabar, forty leagues to the west in the <br />sea there is an archipelago of isles which the Indians say amount to <br />twelve thousand, and they begin in front of mountain Dely and extend <br />southwards. The first are four small flat islands which are called <br />Malandiva, they are inhabited by Malabar Moors and they say that <br />they <br />are from the kingdom of Cananor............Over against Panam, <br />Cochin, and Coulam to the west and south-west at a distance of <br />seventy-five leagues are other islands of which ten or twelve are <br />inhabited by Moors, brown and small in stature who have a separate <br />language and a Moorish king who resides in an island called Mahaldi<br />(v)<br />u. And they call all these islands Palandiva..........Leaving these <br />islands of Mahaldiva further on towards the east where the cape of <br />Comoary......."<br /><br />A Description of the coasts of East Africa and Malabar - by Duarte <br />Barbosa, page 164 & 166<br /><br />From: the above it is very clear the present Maldive Islands and <br />Laccadive Islands (Lakshadeevip) together were known as <br />Palanthivukal <br />to the Indians of the early days. It seems though these islands <br />together would not had an exact count, the Indians from early days <br />believed that there have been twelve thousand islands.<br /><br />But there could have been a good possibility of many more tiny <br />inhabitable islets been in existence in the early days, but not as <br />much as twelve thousand that could have existed during the time of <br />Rajaraja and Rajendra Chola 990 years ago. Many of such small islets <br />could have been possibly submerged into the sea and now left with <br />the <br />present number of Islets as it exists today - as groups of Maldive <br />Islands and Laccadive Islands (Lakshadeevip). <br /><br /><br />Conquer of Palathivukal by Rajaraja Chola Â– 1:   <br /><br />In two inscriptions of the 29th year of Rajaraja Chola - 1 on the <br />walls of Thanjavur Great Temple,<br />we note that there is no mention of Palanthivukal among the list of <br />countries conquered by him.<br /><br />However in two other subsequent inscriptions of the same 29th year <br />in <br />the same temple, we note the Palanthivukal has been included in the <br />list.<br /><br />Hence it is very clear that in the mid of 29th year of Rajaraja's <br />rule the Cholas captured the Palanthivukal, that is in the year (985 <br />+ 29) = A.D.1014 almost towards the end of his reign.<br /><br />The principal reason for capture of these small group of Islets, <br />many <br />of which are inhabitable and with less useful vegetations that could <br />be grown there, could have been that there lived the Sea Priates in <br />these islands who would have been a great hinderence to the Sea <br />Traders from Kerala state and Tamil Nadu state which formed parts of <br />the then Chola Empire, from moving around freely in the Indian Ocean <br />with their trading activities.<br /><br />This would have made Rajaraja Chola to think that it was necessary <br />to <br />capture these Islands too and bring them under the Chola fold, even <br />at the tail end of his rule.<br /><br />Or may be that Rajaraja Chola himself would have felt, that without <br />conquering also these vast number of small Islets close to his <br />mainland empire, that his imperialistic adventures would not be <br />complete.    <br /><br /><br />Conquer of Palanthivukal by Rajendra Chola - 1:  <br /><br />From: the inscriptions of Rajendra Chola Â– 1, we note many of his 6th <br />year inscriptions speak of the capture of Palanthivukal as the last <br />in the list of countries found in his Meikeerthi. We also come <br />across <br />an inscription of his 5th year which too mentions his capture of <br />the <br />Palanthivukal as the last. Hence it is very clear this event would <br />have taken place in the very latter part of his 5th year that is in <br />(1012 +5 ) = A.D.1017.<br /><br />Rajendra Chola - 1 after ascending the throne would have found it <br />necessary to send another expedition to the Palanthivukal to firmly <br />establish their hold on these islands.<br /><br />There "could have been a possibility" that he appointed and left one <br />of his generals with some forces in the principal island among this <br />group of islands, whose generation over a period of time would have <br />become the sole rulers of these islands.    <br /><br />This could have been also the possible reason the "copper plates <br />grant' (known as `Lomafanu' in Maldivian language and as `Sasanam' <br />in <br />Sanskrit) issued in A.D.1196-97 in the "Haddummati Atol" (an Island <br />among the group of modern Maldive Islands), nearly 190 years later<br />after Rajendra's conquest, starts the narration with the <br />words "Swasti Sri" as it was prevalent in Meikeerthis of the Chola <br />kings of that Period. <br /><br />The list of names of the rulers of the island found in these plates <br />are as follows which shows much of South Indian influence. The <br />names <br />are,<br /><br />(1)	Sri Marhabarana<br />(2)	Svasti Sri Buvana Aditya<br />(3)	Svasti Sri Buvanabarana<br />(4)	Svasti Sri Darmmananda<br />(5)	Svasti Sri Srimat Somanga<br /><br />Yet another set of plates from "Bodugala Miskit of Male Atol" <br />(another Island among the group of modern Maldive Islands) issued in <br />A.D.1356-57 too has further names of it's rulers, also having Indian <br />influence. But among them the most interesting one is the name which <br />reads as,<br /><br />"Sri Ra-aradesvara"<br />Could this have been a corruption of Rajarajeswara over a period of <br />approximately 350 years ???<br /><br />All above rferences are from the book titled "The Maldive Islands - <br />Monograph on History & Archaelogy by H.C.P.Bell Â– Pages 179-186 <br /><br />However we do need "more evidence" to prove positively, that these <br />kings were the decendents of "a possible General or Chieftain who <br />would have been placed to be in charge" of these islands by Rajendra <br />Chola.<br /><br />Mr Clarence Maloney in his book titled "People of the Maldive <br />Islands" (Page 107/8) has made the following statements which too <br />are <br />noteworthy.<br /><br />(1)	"the Divehi (the Maldivian language) word for trader <br />is "Soliya", and many foreign ports of call are known in Divehi by <br />their Tamil names.<br /><br />(2)	"Influence of medieval Tamil traders on the Maldives can be <br />seen in most of the Divehi words for trade, and many words for items <br />traded . Words for bundle, to sell, trade, steel, and cloves, and <br />navigation terms such as pilot and compass are of Tamil origin. C(h)<br />ola coins "kasu" which were standard in Sri Lanka and much of South <br />India, have been found in the Maldives too. <br /><br />We also have another interesting account on a king of Maldive <br />Islands, in the Sri Lankan Pali chronicle named Culavamsa (Wilhelm <br />Geiger's Translation Â– Part 1, Page 228) from which we note "few <br />years after the death of king Vijayabahu Â– 1{A.D.1059-1114} of Sri <br />Lanka", during the parallel period when Kuloththunga Chola Â– 1<br />(A.D.1070-1118) was ruling in South India, a warrior lord of the <br />Ariya country by the name "Viradeva" who was the sole sovereign <br />of "Palandipa" (Palanthivukal) invaded Sri Lanka and pursued after <br />its new ruler Vikkramabahu Â– 2 for his capture and for his kingdom. <br />However after Viradeva's initial success, he was finally defeated <br />and <br />killed by Vikkramabahu.<br /><br />From: the above reference it is clear even to Sri Lankans of that <br />period the Maldive Islands were known as "Palandipa".  <br /><br />Further we note, in the year A.D.1070 Kuloththunga Chola Â– 1 became <br />the next successor to the Chola Empire. However he lost the northern <br />part of Sri Lanka in A.D.1088 which he never attempted to regain. <br /><br />"May be" the warrior lord "Viradeva" referred above who was the sole <br />sovereign of Palandipa was a "decendent" of a possible Chola general <br />who was placed in Palandipa during the period of Rajendra Chola, and <br />who with the death of Kuloththunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1118 and <br />becoming <br />independent free of Chola control on Palanthivukal, and with the <br />death of Vijayabahu Â– 1 in A.D.1114 and turmoil following same in <br />Sri <br />Lanka would have thought of capturing this island for himself, and <br />could have possibly made this expedition. <br /><br />However "the above inferences needs further evidences" to prove them <br />positively.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />--- End forwarded message ---</div>

Can you provide similar evidences about <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s <br />China and<br />  other asian conquests? Maldives and Srilanka are really good.<br />  <br /><br />[/mquote]Hi rahul, refer below paper, Mr Rao is still doing research on this <br />thread....<br /><br /><br />The Shipping Technology of Cholas<br /><br /><br /><br />K.V. Ramakrishna Rao B.Sc., M.A., A.M.I.E., C.Eng. (I )., B.L.<br /><br /><br /><br />Introduction: Of late, some researchers[1] have started throwing <br />doubt<br />on the overseas expedition of Rajaraja Chola through Rajendra Chola <br />on<br />the plea that the Parasasti / Meikkirti could have been written with<br />poetic fantasy rather than the factual accuracy. Even, had Rajendra<br />Cholan gone there, it could have been only a raid to loot and not to <br />set<br />foot as a conqueror! Earlier Aidan Southhall[2] analyzed the West<br />African politics in terms of the "segmentary states theory" and<br />applied to medieval European states. Burton Stein[3] applied such <br />model<br />to South India, though Bernard S. Cohn[4] opposed. Burton, then <br />applied<br />such theory to Cholas and George W. Spencer[5] accepting it to <br />declare<br />that in such "segmentary states", the state's functions were<br />custodial rather than regulative, magico-ritualistic rather than<br />managerial. Thus Cholas resorted to the policy of "plunder and<br />piety" just like Frankish kings of early mediaeval Europe. Rajaraja<br />too fulfilled his charitable obligations Â– his "necessary<br />giving" Â– in an extravagant way, aggressively acquiring booty<br />only to donate more lavishly to temples and Brahmans. In such an<br />attempt, the Tanjore inscriptional details of Cholas expedition to <br />South<br />East Asian Countries are dubbed as mere rhetoric. All these continue,<br />though R. C. Majumdar[6] after discussing the "struggle between the<br />Silendras and the Cholas", long back pointed out, "That the<br />story of this victory is not merely an imagination of the court-<br />poets,<br />but based on facts, is proved, beyond doubt, by the detailed <br />references<br />to the vassal states. It is interesting to note that many of these<br />States are included in the Silendra Empire by later Chinese<br />authorities".<br /><br /><br /><br />Though, non-Indian researchers point out the maritime activities[7],<br />international trade, import and export of goods, movement of<br />people-groups with religious beliefs[8] etc., their studies have been<br />restricted to Chinese, Arabic and European exploits or impact with<br />passing remarks to Indians and Cholas. Accepting the fact of Indian<br />goods, people, their religion, temple-building technology etc., going<br />there, but doubting their mode of travel appears illogical and<br />unhistorical. Therefore, a critical study is made in this paper to<br />analyze the shipping, ship-building and naval capabilities of the<br />Cholas.<br /><br /><br /><br />Whether Naval battles were fought or not?: The core is dealt with The<br />concept of oversea expedition and conquer is linked with Naval <br />battles<br />so that the incoming warriors from the ships land and enter into <br />cities<br />so that the conquest is complete. The critical observations made by<br />different researchers are mentioned as follows: <br /><br /><br /><br />George W. Spencer[9]: "In spite of several references in Tanjore<br />record to ships and bodies of water, there is nothing in those purely<br />rhetorical references that requires us to believe that Cholas fought<br />naval battles. Indeed, the equally conventional reference to <br />capturing<br />the Kedah elephants would suggest land battles".<br /><br /><br /><br />Moti Chandra[10] succinctly describes the Cholas expedition to SEA<br />concluding as follows: "In the conquests of Rajendra Chola came<br />almost the whole eastern part of Sumatra, and the central and <br />southern<br />parts of the Malay peninsula. He also occupied the capitals of <br />Srivijaya<br />and Kedah. Perhaps this expedition started in 1025 A.D".<br />Significantly, in next the line, he poses the issue: <br /><br /><br /><br />"The Indian literature does not mention many sea battles. Therefore,<br />we are surprised to read the description of an Indian fleet in<br />Tilakamanjari[11] of Dhanapala[12]. The story mentions that this <br />Indian<br />fleet was led by an Indian prince, Samaraketu of Rangasala. He led <br />this<br />expedition to Indonesia because the feudatory chiefs there refused to<br />pay the tributes and taxes in timeÂ…Â…Â…Â….". Surprised by the<br />close similarity between the narration about Cholas naval expedition <br />and<br />the Tilakamanjari story, he notes: <br /><br /><br /><br />"Whether the sea expedition described in the Tilakamanjari gives<br />glimpses of the victorious expedition of Rajendra Chola, or some <br />other<br />Indian ruler, depends on the exact date of Dharmapala. But, there is<br />hardly any doubt that Dhanapala had an intimate knowledge of<br />Indonesia". Then, he gives a free translation of the story, which<br />narrates as to how the army encamped on the shore, the soldiers <br />marched<br />to the villages, the Indonesian prince meeting the pilot, who was a <br />very<br />clever navigator and did not care for any sea danger, usage of boats<br />while disembarking etc., Thus. The text uses many expressions <br />related to<br />naval expedition. Then , Moti Chandra discusses about hero-stones <br />that<br />depict naval battles ending with A. S. Atlekar's reference[13] to<br />"flotilla of ships". P. C. Chakravarti[14] has dealt with<br />"Navak Warfare in Ancient India", in 1930, particularly pointing<br />out the Naval capabilities of the Tamils.<br /><br /><br /><br />K. V. Raman[15], in the context, just points out the Cholas' trade<br />relation with China and SEA countries without going into the naval<br />aspect. P. Venkatesan[16], though deals with "Naval Battles and<br />Shipwrecks Referred to in Tamil Epigraphs", he repeats the details<br />from the inscriptions of Rajaraja and Rajendra, again not explaining<br />about naval details. But, there have been depiction of ships not <br />only in<br />hero-stones, but also on the coins of Satavahanas, Salankayanas,<br />Pallavas and others and such coins are in fact known as<br />"ship-type" coins.<br /><br /><br /><br />"Ship-type Coins" Of Sathavahanas, Salankayanas, Kurumbas,<br />Pallavas: The introduction of "ship-type coins" has been<br />attributed to the Sathavahanas[17], who were ruling the south during<br />c.200 BCE onwards, just touching the northern boundaries of the <br />Tamils<br />of the Sangam period. Vasishthiputra Pulumavi and Yajna Sri Satakarni<br />have issued Ship-type coins depicting two-mast ships sailing on wavy<br />oceanic waters under partially clouded sky. The coins of Pulumavi <br />have<br />been recovered between Madras and Caddalore proving the existing of<br />ports in that area. The coins of the latter were found in Maharastra.<br />Here, under the two-mast ship fish (LHS) and conch (RHS) are also<br />depicted. The other parts of ship Â– have also been clear. The<br />Salankayanas have also issued similar coins proving that they too had<br />seafaring activities and naval dominance. Interestingly, their ships<br />portray some parts of the ship on both sides under water. Though, <br />they<br />could be easily interpreted as oars, but the shapes negate it. In<br />another coin, a roughly circular shape object attached to one side of<br />the ship. Then come the ship-type coins issued by the Pallavas[18],<br />which depict both one-mast and two-mast ships and also single-mast <br />boat<br />with Nandi / bull symbol on the observe. The picture nos. are given <br />as<br />appearing in the book of R. Krishnamurthy[19] for convenience. In the<br />coins with sl.nos. 25 and 26, the oars are very clear. No.35 also <br />shows<br />two-mast ship. In 36, part of a ship is depicted with a lengthy <br />devise<br />underneath with three rectangular scooped out holes. It could not be <br />an<br />anchor, as it has been depicted with full length of the ship.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sir Walter Elliot[20] gives interesting description for the two-mast<br />ship depicted in Pallava coin: "Two-mast ship like the modern<br />coasting vessel or d'honi, steered by means of oars from the<br />stem". About this ship-type coins, he records that there were two<br />and both were found missing and then, one recovered. In his words<br />[21],<br />"This is one of the two coins mentioned on p.36, supposed to have<br />been lost. It was discovered in arranging the present series, but the<br />other is still missing" (1884). In another Pallava coin (numbered as<br />55 in plate II), he comments that observe has `a horse facing right,<br />with a pellet in front' and reverse `indistinct'. But, the<br />reverse depict a two-decked ship, perhaps which he did not want to<br />acknowledge, as it would be too modern to be imagined in the Pallava<br />period! In fact, he calls them as "Kurumbas". These coins were<br />recovered from the coastal Labis and Merkayars in exchange for useful<br />necessaries. About the coins, he describes as follows[22]: <br /><br /><br /><br />"Those of native origin are small, irregularly rounded pieces of<br />thin copper, bearing generally the device of a bull, with <br />occasionally<br />some letters in Cave-character on the observe; and on the reverse, a<br />tree, ship, star, crab, fish etc. but, their most remarkable<br />characteristic is the elegance and delicacy of form with which the<br />animals are designed, indicating a considerable advance of art; and <br />in<br />this respect contrasting favourably, but with the Andhra money on the<br />one side, and with the Chola, and Pandyan currencies on the other"<br />(emphasis added).<br /><br /><br /><br />Thus, he could have noted the similarity of coins of Cholas and <br />Pandyas,<br />besides Andhras and Kurumbas, as implied in his argument of contrast <br />of<br />art. Coming to Cholas of the material period, the available / <br />reported<br />coins depict only stars, fish prominently (these are specifically<br />mentioned in the context). Therefore, it is intriguing to note that<br />there are no coins issued by Rajaraja or Rajendra either to <br />commemorate<br />their oversea expeditions or victories or at least depict their naval<br />capabilities on their coins. When so many metallurgical highly <br />skilled<br />bronzes are attributed to the Cholas, it is also intriguing that they<br />issued fewer coins. But, considering the disappearance of coins from<br />India[23], it can be surmised that such coins could have gone to the<br />foreigners (just like Leiden Copper plates) and in the possession of<br />private collection (Indian coins are offered for sale in internet).<br /><br /><br /><br />Revenue System proves the Maritime activities of Cholas: The Revenue<br />system of the Cholas interestingly talks about duty on imported goods<br />into their territories. The South Indian Inscriptions have given <br />enough<br />details about it. It is unique in the sense that the levy was imposed<br />based on the type of the vessel in which the goods were imported or<br />imported goods brought in instead of the goods imported. Thus, the <br />levy<br />is mentioned for the following: <br /><br /><br /><br />Ã½ Marakkalam = Ship<br /><br />Ã½ Patavu = Boat<br /><br />Ã½ Kalavam = Raft<br /><br /><br /><br />P. Shanmugam[24] dealing with the topic notes that. ".. a similar<br />tax imports are mentioned in an epigraoph of Ganapatideva (1244). We<br />have no such evidence to suggest a corresponding item in CM<br />(Cholamandalam)". That is, the dilemma implied is that the<br />inscriptions mentioning the three type of naval tax levied are found<br />only in Tondaimandalam and not in Cholamandalam, but such division <br />has<br />been conceived, perceived and applied by us only. It is well known <br />that<br />such import-export, naval-maritime, shipping-shipbuilding activities<br />would be near sea and not interior areas under the Cholas. Therefore,<br />such inscriptions located near sea, here, Kollitturai, are <br />significant.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Navy (of Cholas): Under the caption "The Navy", K. A.<br />Nilakanta Sastri[25] has given the following details and they split <br />into<br />points for interpretation as follows: <br /><br /><br /><br />ÃŠ The `numberless ship' which carried Rajendra's troops<br />across the `rolling sea' to the conquest of Sri Vijaya and its<br />dependencies could not have come up suddenly and must be accepted as<br />proof of a steady naval policy pursued by the Cola monarchs of the<br />period.<br /><br />Ã½ The steady naval policy pursued by the Cola monarchs of the<br />period could not have been without the knowledge of ship-building,<br />ship-technology and shipping.<br /><br />ÃŠ The early Colas of the Sangam period had a good share in the<br />maritime trade and activity of the Indian seas.<br /><br />Ã½ So such "naval policy" had been continuous and not<br />originated suddenly. Thus, the Colas of Sangam period must have had<br />ruled like their contemporary Satavahanas, as otherwise, it is<br />unimaginable or intriguing to note Satavanas ruling states and the <br />Colas<br />without state reportedly leading "tribal state", as has already<br />been suggested by some historians[26].<br /><br />ÃŠ The history of the Hindu colonies in the Malay Archipelago and<br />Indo-China gives clear evidence of a steady increase, under the<br />Pallavas, in the trade and culture contacts between these lands and <br />the<br />countries of South India.<br /><br />Ã½ Thus, the Pallavas navigation technology goes before the Colas in<br />the seafaring actrivities. B. Ch.Chabra[27] has pointed out as to how<br />the Pallava inscriptions of non-Indian sources (available in SEA<br />countries) are dating before the Indian Pallavas. Thus, the overseas<br />trade and shipping of Pallavas cannot be ignored.<br /><br />ÃŠ The Tamil inscriptions of Takuapa53 shows that an important<br />mercantile corporation of South India, the manigramam, had <br />established<br />itself on the opposite coast of the Bay of Bengal in the ninth <br />century<br />A.D.<br /><br />Ã½ Now, there have been many inscriptions found even upto<br />Southern-China and they are discussed separately.<br /><br />ÃŠ The Colas only continued an ancient tradition in the attention<br />they gave to developing their power on the sea. The conquest of <br />Ceylon<br />and the Maldives, and the evidence of the Chinese annals o the <br />embassies<br />that reached China in the period from the Cola country give us some<br />measure of the success they attained in this direction.<br /><br />Ã½ The literary evidences of Sangam literature and the conquest of<br />Ceylon and Maldives had been prelude to their overseas expansion.<br /><br />ÃŠ And the overthrow of the Cera fleet at Kandalur salai may well be<br />taken to mark the definite establishment of Cola naval power in this<br />period in the territorial waters of Southern India. We have little<br />direct evidence on the build of the ships employed.<br /><br />Ã½ Though about the "overthrow of the Cera fleet at Kandalur<br />salai" is interpreted differently, the fact being that not only<br />Colas had maritime capabilities, the Ceras too possessed such<br />capabilities with their unique ship-building and ship-academy.<br /><br />ÃŠ Considering that the author of the periplus distinguished three<br />types of vessels several centuries earlier on the Coromandel coast <br />and<br />that naval expedition of Rajendra was a great achievement in itself, <br />the<br />existence of a well-ordered fleet comprising ships and boats of<br />different grades must be admitted.<br /><br />Ã½ Of course, the "civilized, progressed and advanced"<br />Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs and others would not have been <br />dealing<br />with "mythical goods" of Indians and the latter sailing in<br />"mythical ships".<br /><br />ÃŠ The Arab merchant Sulaiman made several voyages between China and<br />the Persian Gulf in the ninth century A.D., at a time when this long<br />distance trade was being carried on very briskly. In his curious <br />account<br />of Maldives, he says that the people of these islands `built ships<br />and houses and executed all other works with a consummate art'54.<br /><br />Ã½ The mention of Maldives is interesting as it was stronghold of<br />Pallavas once and they were building ships and supplying to others.<br /><br />ÃŠ Sulaiman had no occasion to visit the Coromandel coast; and his<br />voyages were made before the rise of Colas of the Vijayala line into<br />prominence. Taking into account Sulaiman's testimony to the quality<br />of the ships built in Maldives, and the conquest of these islands<br />effected by Rajaraja's fleet, we may form some idea of the<br />efficiency of Cola navy in this period.<br /><br />Ã½ Rather, the Colas tried to imitate the Pallavas in dealing first<br />with the "Pallavas" of Maldives and then Ceras (Kanthalur<br />salai). In any case, the ship-connection (ship-building and<br />ship-academy) is interesting.<br /><br />ÃŠ Abu Zaid Hasan, in the notes which he added to Sulaiman's work<br />about the beginning of the tenth century A.D., observes that the <br />vessels<br />of the Indian ocean, specially those made at Saraf, differed in<br />construction from those of the Mediterranean. `It is a fact that the<br />type of ship built by pieces of wood sewn together is a specially of <br />the<br />builders of Siraf, the ship builders of Syria and of Rum (Byzantum)<br />nail, on the contrary, these pieces of wood and never sew them one to<br />another'55.<br /><br />Ã½ Zaid observation of "sewn Indian ships" must be general,<br />in otherwords that the Indian ships were built in such a way that the<br />joints could not be seen buty appeared as if the wooden planks / <br />parts<br />were sewn together with wooden nails.<br /><br />ÃŠ Today we can see boats on the maras coast with planks<br />`sewn' together by threads of cocoanut fibre. But these are<br />usually of a small size; and the observations of Abu Zaid based on <br />what<br />he saw and heard at Siraf about A.D., 916 on navigation in the Indian<br />Ocean56 should be no obstacle to a just estimate of the size and<br />importance of the navy of the Cola empire more than a century later. <br />If<br />the Arab writers are too early, Marco Polo comes unfortunately too <br />late,<br />and we are without a good contemporary account of ship-building on <br />the<br />Coromandel coast under the Colas.<br /><br />Ã½ Again , this is generalized observation. What used on the Maras<br />coast are boats, but what is discussed here are ships. Therefore, the<br />shipbuilding technology varies accordingly.<br /><br />ÃŠ Ahmad-ibn Majid, an Arab writer of the fifteenth century and<br />author of several nautical works, makes frequent allusion to the<br />opinions of the Cholas which he approves or modifies. He must have <br />had<br />before him a specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola) origin <br />which<br />he compared with Arab documents of a like nature.<br /><br />Ã½ He must be having Indian books on Shipbuilding etc., for example,<br />Kappal Sattiram (the science of ships), Navai Sattram (The <br />Technology of<br />Shipbuilding). When he tried to write without mentioning the sources,<br />naturally, opinion was bound to change because of borrowed ideas.<br />Copying technology is different from understanding science behind it.<br /><br />ÃŠ This literature must have included geographical tables with<br />indications of the latitudes of ports for use of the mariners of the<br />Coromandel coast57.<br /><br />Ã½ Yes, H. B. Sarkar[28] has proved from the sources that the Arabs<br />freely used Indian tables, but circulated them as if they were <br />authors.<br />Baitul Hikmah of Harun-al-Rashid (785-809), and the works attributed <br />to<br />Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (919-921), al-Ishtkhri (934), Ibn Hawqal (c.980),<br />al-Muqaddasi (985), Abdul Fida, Sidi Ali (d.1562) etc., prove the <br />fact.<br /><br />ÃŠ Of this technical literature mentioned by this Arab writers,<br />unfortunately no part seems to have survived.<br /><br />Ã½ Naturally, as pointed out, the Arabs destroyed the Indian<br />originals and circulated their version as their own without any<br />acknowledgement to Indians. And there was no respect for intellectual<br />honesty or intellectual property, rights and so on, which we talk <br />about<br />nowadays!<br /><br /><br /><br />From: the above note of K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, the following facts <br />could<br />be known: <br /><br />Ã³ The navy possessed by the Cholas.<br /><br />Ã³ Their seafaring capabilities.<br /><br />Ã³ Their oversea expedition to SEA countries.<br /><br />Ã³ Arabs testimony to Cholas presence even in the West, besides East<br />(SEA Countries).<br /><br /><br /><br />The Naval expeditions of Cholas mentioned in the Inscriptions: A<br />detailed account of overseas expedition undertaken by Rajaraja <br />through<br />his son and Commander-cum-Captain has been recorded in the <br />inscriptions<br />as "Meikirti", where certain description, expression and words<br />point to Oceanic, maritime and naval details and they are discussed <br />as<br />follows: <br /><br />That the "Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯Â†Ã Â®Â¯Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¿ /<br />Meikkirti" references of the following description of the oversea<br />exploitations imply the science and technology behind: <br /><br />ÃŠ Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â³Ã Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯Âˆ<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â²Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â[29] = He checked / controlled the<br />College of Marine Shipping and Military Academy at Kanthalur, as the<br />Chera King was building ships and selling to Arabs and Europeans and <br />all<br />in turn were acting against the interests of the Cholas. The Chera <br />King<br />perhaps, refused or stopped sending ships required by the Chola <br />Empire.<br />Some take the literal meaning of Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â²Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â as<br />destroying ships, but in the context, it is incongruent and <br />meaningless,<br />as he could not have destroyed, therefore he must have seized the <br />ships<br />meant for Arabs or Europeans, instead of offering to Cholas.<br /><br />ÃŠ Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¨Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â´Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â¯Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯Â = the expression<br />Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¨Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯Â has been frequently used in the ancient<br />Tamil literature from Tolkappiyam and therefore, its usage in <br />historical<br />context has been very significant and its identification with <br />Maldives<br />has been more significant. That the Pallava inscriptions and <br />sculptures<br />have been found in Maldives proves the Tamil connection dating back <br />to<br />3rd cent.CE. Again, interestingly, Maldives play role in supplying<br />cowries (used in astronomy) and as coinage and ships to India Â– that<br />were build with wooden planks sewn together).<br /><br />ÃŠ Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â²Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â™Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â²Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â = the<br />Protector or Lord of places of Ocean (implying ports, port cities and<br />coastal areas). This title is followed by the titles of Narapati,<br />Aswapati, Gajapati etc. Moreover, the conquered places mentioned in <br />the<br />SEA countries happened to be coastal cities or ports.

Again it is mentioned in the context of Kadaram. The extra<br />word used denotes the confronting nature of Kadaram with the Cholas.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here, each word or expression has to be taken in the maritime context<br />instead of appreciating the literary nuance to dub it as a rhetoric.<br />This description has been doubted by researchers as pointed out <br />above.<br />But, considering the description correlating with other evidences, <br />the<br />shipping and navigational skills of Cholas cannot be mythologized.<br /><br /><br /><br />Inscriptions found in the SEA Countries and China[30]: Significantly,<br />inscriptions in mainly Tamil and Tamil bilingual (Tamil with <br />Sanskrit,<br />SEA languages like Thai, and Chinese) have been found in SEA <br />Countries<br />and Eastern China. They are tabulated as follows: <br /><br /><br /><br />Where found / located<br /><br />Script and Language used<br /><br />Dated to<br /><br />Remarks<br /><br />On the hill<br /><br />Khau-Pra-Narai (Bra Narayana), about ten miles upstream on the <br />Takuapa<br />river, on the west coast of peninsular Thailand.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Pallava Grantha and entirely in Tamil.<br /><br />Mid ninth century CE or 870 CE.<br /><br />The tank was dug by the Pallava King Nandivarman III.<br /><br />Valanjiyar Â– a merchant association is mentioned.<br /><br />At the early port site of Loho Tuwa, just to the north of Barus on <br />the<br />west of the island of Sumatra.<br /><br />Tamil in the Kawi script of Java.<br /><br />1010 Saka or 1088 CE<br /><br />Nanaesa-Tisaivavirattu-Ainnurruvar Â– The Merchant association is<br />mentioned.<br /><br />Neusu Aceh, North Sumatra<br /><br /><br /><br />12th century CE<br /><br />It deals with trading regulations among the exporters.<br /><br />Batu Bapahat, west Sumatra<br /><br />Tamil in the Javanese influenced central Sumatran script<br /><br />13th century CE<br /><br />Translation not available<br /><br />Porlak dolok, north Sumatra<br /><br />Tamil and Old Malay / Javanese language.<br /><br />Late 13th cent.CE<br /><br />Invoking God for the protection of the city.<br /><br />Nkhom Si Thammarat Thailand<br /><br />Tamil-Sanskrit, bilingual.<br /><br />Late 13th cent.CE.<br /><br />1183 Saka or 1261 CE<br /><br />Grant given to Brahmans by Senatipati.<br /><br />Pagan, Upper Burma<br /><br />Do<br /><br />13th cent.CE based on paleographic grounds Â– dated by Hultzch<br /><br />Gant of Mantap, door and lamp to a deity.<br /><br />Quanzhou, Eastern China<br /><br />Tamil in Tamil-Chinese language.<br /><br />Late 13th cent.CE<br /><br />Text not completely read and published.<br /><br />It refers to a permission given by Chekchai Khan to Dava <br />Chakravartigal<br />Sambandha Perumal.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cross-checking with Local literature of SEA: H. B. Sarkar[31] after<br />discussing about the so-called "Leiden grant" of Rajaraja Chola<br />(980-1014) delves upon the inscriptional evidences of the Cholas, <br />which<br />asset the conquest of Kadaram even by Virarajendra Cola (1069-1070),<br />implying that the movement of Cholas or representatives of Cholas had<br />been there for nearly 100 years from Rajaraja to Rajendra reign. <br />Quoting<br />Tibbets[32], Sarkar points out that Cholas knew SEA more than the <br />Arabs,<br />as Idrisi could add only two names in the geographical data on<br />South-East Asia: these are Karimata and al-Anam. Joustra[33] pointed <br />out<br />Tamil names in central Sumatra: Coliya, Pandia, Meliyala and Tekang,<br />thus clearly referring to Cola, Pandya, Malayala and the Deccan. Ma<br />Tuan-lin[34] records about the Chu-lien mission to China reaching <br />there<br />in 1025. Then, he mentions about one text Nagarakritagama is an<br />old-Javanese literary work (dated to 1365). The text was discovered <br />from<br />Bali in 1894, translated and published later. In this work, the Colas<br />are designated as Coda or Gauda. It mentions the places which were<br />raided by the soldiers of Rajendra Cola as Kampar, Kampe, Haru, <br />Parlak,<br />Samudra etc., (Nagar.13. 1-2). The local stories, particularly, the<br />story of Manimekhalai show similarity. Of course, the art and<br />architecture prove the Indian influence, which is too well known to <br />be<br />repeated here.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Astronomy of Chola Period: The Shipping, navigation and <br />astronomy go<br />together. Rajaraja encouraged astronomy and there was Colleges<br />exclusively at important cities like Madurai, Tanjai and<br />Trichirappalli[35]. Incidentally, there was an astronomer hailing <br />from<br />Gagnaikonda Cholapuram, which is mentioned as Gangapuri, Gangapura <br />and<br />Sriranga-gangapuri (Epigraphgica Indica xv, p.49) with prefix Sri-<br />ranga<br />(the stage of goddess of prosperity). His name was Suryadeva[36] and<br />also known as Suryadeva Yajva, Suryadeva Somasut and Suryadeva <br />Dikshita<br />(c.1191- 1260 CE). He was born on Monday, 3rd that of the dark half <br />of<br />Magha, Saka 1113 (= 1191 CE). The ahargana for that day, according to<br />Aryabhata-siddhanta was 15,68,004, i.e, so may days elapsed since<br />Kaliyuga. So dividing 15,68,004 by 365.25, we get 4293. Subtracting<br />3102, we get 1191 (4293-3102=1191), this tallies with the year <br />obtained<br />based on Saka era 1113+78=1191 (Ã Â¤ÂµÃ Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â¶Ã Â¤ÂµÃ Â¥Â‡Ã Â¤Â¶Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â¤ 1113<br />Ã Â¤Â¶Ã Â¤Â•Ã Â¥Â‡Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â—Ã Â¤Â•Ã Â¥ÂƒÃ Â¤Â¶Ã Â¤Â£). He was a Brahmin with Nidhruva<br />gotra belonging to the Chola country and a resident of Gangaikonda<br />Cholapuram and thus, evidently patronized by the Chola Kings. <br />Rajendra<br />Chola (1012-1044) founded the city to commemorate his victory over<br />Ganges campaign. Probably, Somadeva Yajva's forefathers had been<br />with the Cholas and he could be the Royal Astronomer he was the<br />Principal of the Astronomical College (Vidhyalaya) in the Chola<br />territories interacting with others. This all of sudden could not <br />have<br />come into existence. Referring to Post-Sangam literature, we come <br />across<br />Civaga Cintamani (dated to 9th-10th centuries, verse no.995) <br />mentioning<br />existence of Colleges as follows: <br /><br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â²Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â²Ã Â®Â™Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â²Ã Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â¿<br /><br />When time comes (after primary education), the youth are admitted to<br />College (for higher studies). Thus, the mention of<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â²Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â²Ã Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â¿ is very interesting and significant to prove<br />the well-established educational system in the Tamizhagam during<br />9th-10th centuries.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thus, Professor Somadeva Yajvan must have been teaching and <br />researching<br />there. He has written commentaries on the following works: <br /><br />6 Aryabhatiya (c.500).<br /><br />6 Mahayatra of Varahamihira (c.500)<br /><br />6 Laghumanasa of Majula (c.932).<br /><br />6 Jataka-paddhathi of Sripati (c.1039)<br /><br />His commentary on Sripati proves that the Indian astronomers were in<br />touch with each other discussing on the subject matter dealt with.<br /><br /><br /><br />As mentioned, the forefathers of Suryadeva or their disciples must <br />have<br />accompanied with Rajendra during his overseas campaigns. Thus, during<br />the Chola period, the knowledge of geography accompanied with<br />cartography must have been there, as otherwise, Rajendra chola could <br />not<br />have navigated and directed his ships exactly going to the respective<br />countries, carried the campaign by landing on the shores respective<br />cities of the countries after anchoring. He must have used small <br />boats<br />to reach the shores. After campaign, he must have come back to his <br />ship<br />and started sailing after de-anchoring. This proves that Cholas were<br />having maps of India accompanied with the South East countries. <br />However,<br />it is intriguing and surprising to note none of the maps are <br />available<br />or reported in possession of anybody.<br /><br /><br /><br />Civaga Cintamani (verse no. 882) mentions about the existence of<br />"books on the knowledge of Oceans", which is very significant in<br />the context: <br /><br /><br /><br />Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â£Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â£Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯Âˆ<br />Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â±Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯Â‡Ã Â®Â³Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â¿<br />Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂˆÃ Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯Â<br /><br />Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â™Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â´Ã Â®Â²Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â±Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂˆÃ Â®ÂšÃ Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â´Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â±Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯Â<br /><br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â£Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂªÃ Â¯ÂŠÃ Â®Â²Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â™Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂªÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯Â<br /><br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â¯Â‹Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â©Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â©Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂšÃ Â¯Â‚Ã Â®Â´Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â³Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â<br />Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â‹Ã Â®Â±Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â±Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯ÂŠÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯Â‡.<br /><br /><br /><br />The brothers are having hands which are well-versed in the handling <br />of<br />glittering swords and as well as well-written books on Oceans (The<br />sailors of all categories Â– traders, businessmen, should be warriors<br />and also good navigators with the knowledge of shipping, astronomy,<br />geography and oceanography). As Civaga, the hero is encircled with <br />his<br />brothers shining, the cool Moon is also encircled with other planets <br />and<br />asterism (visible clearly during the night, as could be observed by <br />them<br />on the ship during their voyage, i.e, the knowledge of stellar<br />navigation is also a must for them).<br /><br /><br /><br />6 The mention of availability of books on the knowledge of <br />Oceans<br />is significant.<br /><br />6 "The Books on the Knowledge of Oceans" covers all<br />aspects of Ships, shipping etc.,<br /><br />6 That the sailors should be capable of handling swords and <br />such<br />books is also significant considering the dangers involved in<br />ocean-trade, visiting many countries, the nature of peopled dealt <br />with<br />in trading etc.<br /><br />6 Interestingly, both the Science of Ocean and the Sky are<br />mentioned together in the same context figuratively.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Astronomical link among the SEA countries and India: The Siamese<br />[37]<br />and Tiruvalore[38] astronomical tables created a great storm in the<br />Europe making the mathematicians, astronomers and scientists to study<br />them to find out the accuracy[39], as they reportedly had <br />calculations<br />starting from Kaliyuga that started coinciding with a planetary<br />conjunction or alignment that occurred around 3102 BCE[40]. The <br />movement<br />of Cholas, particularly, Somadeva Yajvan with Rajendra to SEA <br />countries<br />could be a source for the spread of such knowledge. Moreover,<br />historically, the entire area was known as "India" according to<br />the middle-east and European people, as is evident from their <br />writings<br />and maps[41]. The flooding of Jesuits to Siam attacking Royal<br />palaces[42], infiltrating temples and Buddhist Viharas and <br />researching<br />the scholars for astronomical, geographical and medical manuscripts<br />speak the motive[43]. The movements of selected Jesuits from Cochin <br />and<br />Goa to China and back[44], SEA countries and back to Pondicherry,<br />Tranqubar etc., prove their collection of scientific and technical<br />manuscripts, tables, charts and materials.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Disappearance of Indian Astronomical documents, instruments and<br />maps: Like the details of Indian shipping, the astronomical <br />documents,<br />instruments and maps are also surprisingly missing, though, usage of<br />them were there, as the naval expedition had been the proof. K. A.<br />Nilakanta Sastri's observation[45] made on Ahamad-ibn Majid are<br />interesting to note: <br /><br /><br /><br />"Ahmad-ibn Majid, an Arab writer of the fifteenth century and author<br />of several nautical works, makes frequent allusion to the opinions of<br />the Cholas which he approves or modifiues. He must have had before <br />him a<br />specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola) origin which he <br />compared<br />with Arab documents of a like nature. This literature must have <br />included<br />geographical tables with indications of the latitudes of ports for <br />use<br />of the mariners of the Coromandel coast. of this technical literature<br />mentioned by this Arab writers, unfortunately no part seems to have<br />survived".<br /><br /><br /><br />Ferrand26 in his writing has clearly pointed out as follows: <br /><br /><br /><br />`Dans tous ses ouvrages nautiques, Ibn Majid fait frequemment<br />allusion'a l' opinion des Colas qu'il appropuve ou rectifie.<br />Ce'st qu'il devait avoir en main les Insructions nautiques<br />tables geographuques avec indication de la latitude des ports,<br />utilis'ees par les marins du Coromandel et qu'il les comparait<br />avee les documents arabes des meme nature'.<br /><br /><br /><br />Therefore, the following questions arise: <br /><br /><br /><br />Ã³ What were the allusions made about Cholas by Ahamad-ibn Majid?<br /><br />Ã³ Why he approves or modifies such allusions?<br /><br />Ã³ What was "a specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola)<br />origin" possessed by the Arabs?<br /><br />Ã³ Why he compared Arab records with Tamil-Chola nauctiical<br />literature?<br /><br />Ã³ After comparision, what he did with such "specilised nautical<br />literature of Tamil (Cola) origin"?<br /><br />Ã³ If the "specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola)<br />origin" included "geographical tables with indications of the<br />latitudes of ports for use of the mariners of the Coromandel coast",<br />what happened to such geographical tables?<br /><br />Ã³ K. A. N. Nilakanda Sastri could say only that, "Of this<br />technical literature mentioned by this Arab writers, unfortunately no<br />part seems to have survived".<br /><br /><br /><br />More Evidences to prove that Indian maps were taken away: The <br />following<br />references are given to show the vulnerable condition of Indian<br />researchers, when most of the historical evidences are in the<br />collections of the foreigners, which are not easily accessible.<br />Encyclopedia Britannica (1952 edition) gives the following details<br />[46]: <br /><br /><br /><br />"The charts in use by medieval navigators of the Indian ocean Â–<br />Arab, Persians or Dravidians Â– were in equal in value if not<br />superior to the charts of Mediterranean. Marco Polo (1292) mentions <br />such<br />charts; Vasco Da Gama (1498) found them in the hands of Indian pilot,<br />and their value is fully explained in the Mohit or encyclopedia of <br />the<br />sea compiled from ancient sources by the Turkish Admiral Sidi Ali Ben<br />Hosssein in 1554. These charts are covered with a close net work of<br />lines intersecting each other at right angles. The horizontal lines <br />are<br />parallels, depending upon the altitude of the pole star, the calves, <br />the<br />little Bear and the Barrow of the Great Bear above the horizon. This<br />altitude was expressed in "isbas" or inches each equivalent to<br />104'50". Each isba was divided into "Zams" or eights.<br />The interval between the parallels thus amounted to 12'51".<br />These intervals were mistaken by the Portuguese occasionally for<br />degrees, which accounted for Malacca, which is, in latitude 2013'N.<br />being placed on Cartino's chart (1502) in lat. 14'S. it may have<br />been a map of this kind which accounts for Ptolemy's moderate<br />exaggerations of the size of Toprobana (Ceylon). A fdirst meridian,<br />eparating a leeward from a windward region, passed through Ras Kumari<br />(Camorin) and was thus nearly identical with the meridian of the <br />Indian<br />astronomer which passed through the sacred city of Ujjain (Ozone of<br />Ptolemy) or the meridians of Azin of the Arabs. Additional meridians<br />were drawn at intervals of Zams, supposed to be equal to three hours<br />sail".<br /><br /><br /><br />As the taking away or possession of such "specilised nautical<br />literature of Tamil (Cola) origin including geographical tables with<br />indications of the latitudes of ports for use of the mariners of the<br />Coromandel coast" by the Arabs was accepted, it is evident that they<br />compared, used and prepared tables and maps, but suppressed or <br />destroyed<br />the Indian originals. And we know lot of maps produced exactly during<br />that period onwards attribute to the Arab / Mohammedan / Muslim<br />geographers / cartographers and so on. This is just similar to the<br />Jesuits who took Indian books, instruments, charts, tables, samples <br />etc<br />on Indian science and technology. In any case, we have to show <br />evidences<br />for such happening. Here, comes the manuscript of "Kappal<br />Sattiram"[47].<br /><br /><br /><br />Kappal Sattiram Â– Science and Technology of Ships and Shipping: <br />Indians used to write books on Palm-leaves, particularly, in South<br />India. They used different scripts to Sanskrit and Tamil languages o<br />various subjects. Most of the original Sanskrit books are missing as<br />they must have been destroyed by the Mohammedans, taken away by the<br />Mohammedans for study and also by European missionaries. As the <br />demand<br />for books increased with the exigencies, more books could have been<br />produced engaging the scribes. An expression, "Tiruppugira<br />Pusthakam" found in "Kappal Sattiram" 37 (Science and<br />Technology of Ships and Shipping) proves that copies of books were <br />made<br />from the translations and as well as originals. The expressions "Edu<br />Tiruppudhal" (turning the pages) and "Tiruppugira Pusthakam"<br />(the book that is turned) convey copying a book from its original, so<br />that the original could be preserved and the copy given away or <br />sold. As<br />per the directions of the Danish, in the house of Kangirayap Pillai <br />or<br />Kalingarayap Pillai, a Dubash, the book was dictated and a scribe had<br />written down. The name of the book is mentioned as<br />"Nikamasigamani", a Sanskrit name. As the last line of 8th song<br />clearly mentions that, "Salaikathirangan sorppadi idanai tamil<br />seythittan", it is evident that as per the directions of one<br />Salaikathirangan, it was made into Tamil i.e, translated into Tamil <br />from<br />Sanskrit. As it was known that there was a work named "Nauka<br />Sastra" in Sanskrit, that book might have been used for translation.<br />Here, Kangiyap Pillai says that he is producing the book as per the<br />directions of Danish in 1620 (of Salivahana Era) or 1698 of CE in his<br />house. So the Danish used different tactics to get the science and<br />technology books from the Indians.<br /><br /><br /><br />The book gives the following details (the author's comments are<br />given in different colour): <br /><br /><br /><br />Ã³ The standard measurement is given (Verse.3).<br /><br />Ã³ The time suitable for manufacture of ocean-going vessels is given<br />astronomically based on an earlier work, "Nigama Sigamani"<br />(Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â® Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â£Ã Â®Â¿, Verse.4).<br /><br />Ã³ The properties of ships (5).<br /><br />Ã³ The suitable time for navigation is given (6-9).<br /><br />Ã³ The best time for fixing of mast is given (13).<br /><br />Ã³ A Tamil king "Parasi Vendan", who helps shipping<br />technology, is mentioned.<br /><br />Ã³ When a ship could sail safely, when it might face with danger,<br />when a ship may wreck, and such other exigencies are mentioned (23-<br />28).<br />Thus, it is amply evident that the Tamils knew the ship wreckage<br />occurred as a result of piracy by non-Indians. As they followed the<br />rules and regulations of nature and sailed in the prescribed time, <br />the<br />wreckage due to natural disasters like tempest, cyclones, rough <br />weather<br />etc., must have been minimal.<br /><br />Ã³ Mathematics involving points / dots is mentioned (29). As it is<br />not explained, it is not known exactly what mathematical method or<br />mathematics involving points was used in the maritime context. But, <br />it<br />must have been connected with Cartography making points on the maps<br />drawn, developed, corrected and modified. In those days, maps could <br />have<br />been produced only after undertaking any voyages. Ironically, such<br />projection in navigation charts used is known as the Mercator, named<br />after the Flemish mathematician and geographer Gerardus Mercator<br />(1512-94), who reportedly devised it. But it is evident that they <br />must<br />have known from Indians, as existence of such method is mentioned <br />here.<br /><br />Ã³ Experts of Books without any weariness (31). It is mentioned that<br />these details are given by the Experts of Books without any weariness<br />implying that they exclusively engaged in such observatory and<br />cartographic work making projections etc.<br /><br />Ã³ When the destruction of a ship with cargo would occur (33) is<br />mentioned.<br /><br />Ã³ When a ship would return successfully with earned profits after<br />selling the goods aboard (37) is given. These two exigencies have <br />been<br />given in astrological interpretation, but involving astronomical<br />observation. The Tamils must have found out the arrival of Arab and<br />European vessels to SEA countries at a particular time, as their<br />starting with winds from their destinations had been different from <br />that<br />of Indians. However, they tried to coincide with the timings of <br />Indians<br />with an intention to compete initially and then seize cargo by piracy<br />realizing their law abiding nature. Moreover, the cunning Arabs and<br />Europeans must have used Indian flags, symbols, dress etc., to cheat<br />the Indians to complete their piracy.<br /><br />Ã³ Persons with two eyes and one eye are compared figuratively with<br />Sun and Moon. Danger to cargo would come from the persons with one <br />eye<br />(39), as they stealthily attack other vessels without following any<br />marine-ethics or Maritime regulations. This is clear indication that<br />Tamils knew of the nature of pirates, who were not Indians, as they <br />were<br />not following the Indian ethics of not attacking the vessels of <br />others.<br />Incidentally, the western depiction of standard pirates have been<br />"one-eyed"!<br /><br />Ã³ Interestingly, another point implied is about the persons with<br />"Surya dhristi", "Chandra dhristi", "Raja<br />dhristi", Griha dhristi", "Rakka dhristi" etc. They were<br />nothing but persons with eye-sight of Moon, Sun, King, Planets, sides<br />etc. in other words, the ocean going ships had such experts / <br />observers<br />of Solar, lunar, planetary motions and time calculations. As they <br />had to<br />visit different countries, they had to know about the Kings of such<br />countries, thus the experts of Kings. And there were experts in<br />observing directions also, as it is important in navigation. As such<br />things could have been possible with past experience, it is evident <br />that<br />the experts mentioned must have had books on such subject matter.<br /><br />Ã³ Suddenly, the work changes from poetry to prose giving statistical<br />details of planets, asterisms, stars etc.<br /><br />Ã³ Thus, the measurements for masts are given.<br /><br />Ã³ The measurements for anchors are given.<br /><br />Ã³ Measurement details of a "English ship" is given.<br /><br />Ã³ At the end, it is appended with "Silpa sastram" (A Manual<br />of Sculpre) only with 13 verses.<br /><br />Ã³ As most of the verses have been written with defective words,<br />language and grammar, it is evident that the Danish must have engaged<br />poor scribes to write this work, evidently to substitute, as the<br />original was taken away by them.<br /><br />Ã³ Many verses have been adopted or imported straight away from the<br />following earlier works: <br /><br />Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â®Â°Ã Â®Â¸Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®ÂµÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â…Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¿<br /><br />Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â¯Â‹Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®ÂŸÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â£Ã Â®Â¿<br /><br />Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â£Ã Â®Â•Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â°Ã Â®Â®Ã Â¯Â<br /><br />Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â¯Â€Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â® Ã Â®ÂšÃ Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â•Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Â®Ã Â®Â£Ã Â®Â¿<br /><br />However, the scribe has not acknowledged the source.<br /><br />Ã³ As the work has been incomplete in many aspects, it is evident<br />that the copy has been only a part of a bigger book.<br /><br /><br /><br />"Navai Sattiram"[48]: It is only part of the original work, as<br />the available 64 leaf-book does not give more details that that of <br />the<br />above "Kappal Sattiram". Most of the available songs delve on<br />the auspicious time, date and period for start and return of journey<br />with astrological couch. In fact, same songs are repeated, however,<br />subject matter is concerned, it differs and at many places it is<br />incomplete and thus, there must have been complete book. <br />Particularly,<br />after discussing about the wooden planks used for mast, the verses <br />are<br />found to be with broken sentences. Therefore, the copyist must have<br />hurriedly copied from the original work. The crude drawing of a<br />three-mast ship also proves the fact, as in many other manuscripts, <br />very<br />good pictures with minute details have been drawn.<br /><br /><br /><br />Piercing the veil of Buddhism: If the veil of Buddhism is pierced, <br />the<br />treatment of all Buddhists Â– Indians, Chinese, Ceylonese, and SEA<br />categories alike, would be removed. The tracing of maritime trade<br />between the India and the ports Southern China to first centuries <br />points<br />to such a possibility. As Tamil Siddhas[49] have made their claimed<br />sojourns or voyages to China, Chinese have also done[50]. Haraprasad<br />Ray[51] has pointed out the links between India and China based on <br />the<br />Chinese records. Thus, as described by the Imperunkappiyangal, the <br />Tamil<br />and other Indian merchants had reached China, as evidenced by the<br />archaeological evidences of Quanzhou region. Tamil / South Indian<br />merchants had been there already in the Southeast Asia from the first<br />centuries. The Buddhist interpretation of events has made all people <br />to<br />appear as "Buddhists", but Indians of the whole region acted and<br />interacted together irrespective of their personal religious beliefs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thus, the oobservation of Tansen Sen[52] that,"some credit for the<br />`emergence of a world market' must go to the Chola (or Cola)<br />kingdom in Southern India. The trading ports and mercantile guilds of<br />the Chola kingdom, he suggests, played a significant role in linking <br />the<br />markets of China to the rest of the world" has been apt. The<br />movement of "Brahmanas and Sramanas" here had been phenomenal<br />along with other groups. As they already settled or colonized or<br />established themselves, their building activities had been natural<br />exhibiting in the material culture. Thus, the Pallava, Chola, <br />Silendra<br />and other influences are found in script, literature, sculpture and <br />art.<br /><br /><br /><br />Indian Maritime Trade with Africa: The South Indian maritime trade <br />with<br />East African coastal countries during medieval period has been very<br />interesting and revealing throwing light on Pallava, Chola and <br />Kadamba<br />maritime trade and shipping. The movement of merchandise cargo from<br />south Indian ports through Maldives, Chagos for Archipelago, <br />Mauritius,<br />Reunion, Madagascar and coastal East Africa has been easiest the <br />South<br />Indian marine-traders[53]. Incidentally, these islands were used by <br />the<br />Pallava and Cholas for their ship-building activities. Pallava<br />sculptures, inscriptions and temples have been found in Maldives[54].<br />How the Pallavas could have exercised their influence far and wide<br />distances from SEA countries to East African coast could be noted <br />from<br />these archaeological evidences found in those places. During Pallava,<br />Chola and Kadamba period, the Indian metal workers had achieved <br />highest<br />state of art and their skill been a great demand throughout the <br />world.<br />In fact, before the advent of Islam, the movement of Indians to <br />Africa<br />had been very smooth without any maritime strife.<br /><br /><br /><br />The finding of a bronze lion statuette[55] at trading port of Shanga,<br />Lamu District, Kenya, in January 1986 raised many questions. It has <br />been<br />dated to 1100 CE and compared with that of Central and South Indian<br />counterparts, because of close resemblances and casting techniques.<br />Moreover, the lion is easily comparable with the depiction noted on<br />South Indian coins also starting from 1st century BCE with<br />characteristic features. E. C. L. During Caspers[56] has pointed out<br />that the practice of trading bronze animals within the Indian Ocean<br />dates back to at least the 2nd millennium BC. Scientific analysis of <br />the<br />composition of bronzes found at Africa and South India and historical<br />evidence of maritime goods prove that either, Indians exported such<br />bronzes to Africa or the settled Indian metal workers created them.<br />Roger Summer[57] brought out the gold-mining techniques of Zimbabwe <br />had<br />been very similar to Deccan / South India. Hromnik pointed out that <br />the<br />Indians of Africa were also responsible for the introduction of <br />cattle<br />and crops, the stone architecture of Great Zimbanwe and by attracting<br />Negroid labouers to the south, for the Bantu migrations as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />It may be noted that the vague references of Herodotus Indians <br />supplying<br />to "gold dust" and ferrum Indicum to the Persians and the Greeks<br />prove the metallurgical skill of Indians since c.1500 Â– 300 BCE<br />period. The Bongozkai insprition already proved the Indian presence <br />in<br />the Mesopotamian area around c.1450 BCE. Thus, the fine casting<br />technology of Cholas could easily be correlated and corresponded with<br />the African specimens. Therefore, the South Indian history in the<br />context of metallurgy has to be recast with these metallurgical<br />evidences.<br /><br /><br /><br />The findings[58] of Thor Heyerdahl, Prof. Arne SkjÃ¸lsvold and Prof.<br />Egil Mikkelsen have brought out the remains of a temple, Raksha-like<br />sculptures with Pallava-type inscription The local Maldive people<br />arrange shells in such a way, they look like a stupa - ruined <br />miniatures<br />of satihirutalu which formed the apex of the Maldive Buddhist <br />usthumbu.<br />The usthumbu has three parts: the quadrangular base representing <br />earth;<br />the bell-shaped middle part, representing water; and the satihirutalu<br />representing <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>which crowns the usthumbu. The Buddhist stupa[59] <br />from<br />Kaiyuan Temple, adjacent to the site of the Quanzhou Maritime History<br />Museum resembles exactly like that of Maldive model. The pagoda spire<br />with lotus base of the stupa has striking resemblance with the <br />material<br />evidence and also that of Manimekhalai decription. Therefore, the<br />connection of Pallavas and Cholas with these areas is very visible.<br /><br /><br /><br />The motive behind the conquests of Cholas: Considering maritime and<br />other activities, the maritime activities or the over-sea <br />expeditions /<br />conquests could be interpreted in their attempt to establish their<br />monopoly. Thus, many times scholars have expressed that they could <br />not<br />understand the motive behind the conquests, when all Kings had been<br />earning profits in over-sea trade. The conquest of southern<br />Karnatakadesa by Rajendra in 1032, has been definitely securing <br />internal<br />trade routes in southern India and as well as control the western <br />ports,<br />where Gujaratis and Arabs were dominating. Moreover, the left out <br />Cholas<br />could be considered as "Kadamas" by modern-day historians[60].<br />Kadambas had been so powerful on the western coast, that their <br />influence<br />was felt on the eastern African coast and middle east countries. They<br />had the title "The Lord of Western Ocean". Their inscription[61]<br />point to their maritime actrivities and authority over the western<br />ocean. Their fleet was so powerful that they could conquest many <br />islands<br />and lands as recorded in the inscriptions. The Nadukals <br />intrerestingly<br />depict the fleet, naval battles, and other minute details of ship<br />technolgy carved on them[62].<br /><br /><br /><br />The conquest of Southeast Asia in 1025 and again in the 1070s, the<br />occupation of Sri Lanka in 1080 prove such dominating attempt. The<br />Chola-China commercial links reached at an appreciable level with the<br />exchange of missions with gifts. That the Chinese could build a <br />Vihara<br />at Nagapattinam proves the establishment of such relationship as <br />proved<br />by the Dao-yi zhi-lue account. The Chinese inscription found there<br />vouchsafes it. The Japanese scholars[63] pointed out he trade between<br />the ports of South China and the Cholas evidenced by the 11-12th <br />century<br />Chinese ceramic remains found in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The <br />Classical<br />Chinese texts[64] and Siddhas poems convey that the Chinese obtained<br />pepper from Indian ports, and Indians mercury, certain chemicals etc<br />from China.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusion: As seen, some scholars doubted the Chola inscriptions on <br />the<br />plea that they are rhetoric without going into the facts or<br />cross-checking the doubted claims with the local evidences of SEA<br />countries. Why the well-established Cholas could not have issued <br />coins<br />depicted their maritime excellence, while their predecessors<br />Sathavahanas, Salankyanas, Kurumbas, Pallavas could have issued<br />ship-type coins is not explained. As pointed out by Sir Walter Elliot<br />that ship-type Kurumba / Pallava coins could be obtained on exchange <br />of<br />necessities, what would have happened to other coins, had they been <br />paid<br />with valuables instead of necessities is not considered in the <br />context.<br />Incidentally, it has to be noted that the Tiruvalangadu Copper <br />plates,<br />ironically known as "Leiden grants" and most of the<br />"ship-type" coins have been now in possession of foreign<br />museums. Therefore, the fate of missing coins is not taken into<br />consideration.<br /><br /><br /><br />As the material period 11th century had been dominated by Cholas,<br />Silendras and SEA powers within "Indian domain" and the Arabs<br />and Chinese playing with them, the Indian rulers could have been<br />exercising their influence only within their domains and crossed the<br />boundaries, when the powers of others declined. Therefore, the <br />theories<br />of "segmentary rule / power", "piety-plunder" etc.,<br />could not be applied by generalizations. The European medieval of<br />"Frankish plunder and distribution" is not applicable to Cholas.<br /><br /><br /><br />That the Cholas granted tax-free lands to Brahmans only to pursue <br />their<br />astronomical activities, as has been vouchsafed by Suryadeva Yajvan, <br />as<br />astronomy helped the navigation and not to support their hegemony. In<br />fact, the work of Brahmins stopped with astronomical activities, as <br />the<br />navigational work and techniques were carried on by other <br />professional<br />groups. In fact, in such supposedly or assumed raidings and <br />plunderings,<br />only non-Brahmin groups had been evidently involved. Therefore, such<br />casteist interpretation would not help to decide the maritime <br />sojourns<br />effected by the Cholas.<br /><br /><br /><br />The struggle between Silendras and Cholas in India and as well as the<br />rivalry among them with Chinese in SEA have resulted in some <br />documents,<br />particularly that of Chinese, which create wrong impression. In an<br />established governance and tax-collection, the raids, confiscation <br />and<br />other punitive punishments against tax evaders has been normal <br />feature<br />and it could not be interpreted as something unwarranted or <br />historically<br />unacceptable. Tribute payment is just like tax compliance. Thus, even<br />had the Cholas raided the tax evading Sri Vijaya, Cheras and Sri <br />Lankan,<br />that would fit to any democratic State governance. The circumstantial<br />and correlative evidences Â– the literary evidences, the existence of<br />Naval architecture books, international trade, impost of tax on goods<br />imported through different types of vessels, rivalry among the <br />competing<br />national groups etc., have been normal feature and prove the oversea<br />expedition of the Cholas.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[1]George W.
