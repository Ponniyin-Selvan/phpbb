Their capital was at<br />Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu<br />also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies<br />acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located deep<br />south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil the<br />southern end of the Aye kingdom.<br /><br />The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering a<br />region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam<br />Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city on<br />the west Kerala.<br /><br />The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond Kottayam<br />further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />(Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, and<br />a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country of<br />that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu,<br />bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their<br />rule during this period.<br /><br />Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by<br />Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under<br />different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who accepted<br />the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their respective<br />regions as subordinates to them.<br /><br />The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola<br /><br />Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a powerful<br />Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the <br />Kolli -<br />Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his capital<br />at Mahodayapuram.<br /><br />He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the<br />Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the Pandiya<br />country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during<br />this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the Kulasekara<br />dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule over<br />this region.<br /><br />Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an<br />incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this period<br />referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.<br /><br />He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, and<br />Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has<br />composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named<br />as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". He<br />abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated as<br />one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />Kulasekara Alvar.<br /><br />The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With<br />the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son Rajasekaran<br />{A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also known<br />by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent<br />devotee of God Siva.<br /><br />Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram spent<br />most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the<br />Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in the<br />Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil Saiva<br />Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a pilgrimage to<br />the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva Saint,<br />also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.<br /><br />Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king<br />composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai" . From<br />there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to the<br />Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva<br />Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in<br />Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and venerated<br />as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him have<br />been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by various<br />Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State).<br /><br />Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the<br />Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace of<br />this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera<br />country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />(Udagai) region of TamilNadu.<br /><br />While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died.<br />Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the<br />same year.<br /><br />It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly<br />during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva<br />Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who founded<br />the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.<br /><br />It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from<br />Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him<br />named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country,<br />has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the Venattu<br />Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />Sundaramurthi Nayanar.<br /><br />The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was followed<br />by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran (alias<br />Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.<br />Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter by<br />the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another<br />Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.<br /><br />It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the Chola<br />dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in partial or<br />total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly six<br />centuries.<br /><br />Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}<br /><br />The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into prominance<br />was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881} , who ruled the Chola<br />country from Thanjavur.<br /><br />It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly<br />relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter<br />both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good relations<br />that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to the<br />Siva temples in the Chola country<br /><br />In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi<br />also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravart i Kulasekaradeva, the<br />villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur in<br />the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as Tiruayanisuramudaiy a<br />Nayanar.<br /><br />The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the temple of<br />Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in the<br />year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi also<br />gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.<br /><br />Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}<br /><br />In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son<br />Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who was<br />a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his rule<br />the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera king<br />Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.<br /><br />A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly<br />instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded<br />jointly by the Chola & Chera kings with a crown, palace, elephants,<br />royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil Verl".<br /><br />Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani Ravi<br />died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A. D.885-917} on the<br />Chera throne.<br /><br />During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan (A.D.860-<br />905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them was<br />born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920) .<br /><br />Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907- 953}<br /><br />Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-953)<br />on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal<br />daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He also<br />married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the present<br />Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further<br />queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the Venad<br />King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.<br /><br />Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger son<br />by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.<br /><br />A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran<br />was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the Prince<br />Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.<br /><br />Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu waged<br />war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king Rama<br />Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.<br /><br />Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha and<br />his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at<br />Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri<br />Lanka.<br /><br />As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri Lankan<br />king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to the<br />Chera Country of his mother.<br /><br />The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost among<br />the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara dynasty,<br />paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these two<br />countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems to<br />have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.<br /><br />The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of<br />Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting<br />lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923.<br /><br />In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of the<br />Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country<br />gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu<br /><br />In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu<br />gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in Cholanadu.<br /><br />In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for<br />lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur.<br /><br />She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her time<br />a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present Pondicherry)<br />and named after her as Kokkilanadi- pereri in Chola country.<br /><br />There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala Kurumban<br />given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola with the<br />title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the<br />temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.<br /><br />In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera king<br />Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for lighting<br />lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in Thondainadu<br />which was under Chola rule.<br /><br />Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />(Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a lamp<br />to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.<br /><br />In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple to<br />Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in Thondaimandalam.<br /><br />Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram in<br />Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur<br />(Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.<br /><br />Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur A.D.952<br /><br />Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, the<br />king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917- 947} succeeded on the Chera throne at<br />Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.<br /><br />After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.<br /><br />Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}<br /><br />After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola (A.D..950-<br />957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his<br />thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious life,<br />and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known<br />as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />Thirumurai.)<br /><br />Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}<br /><br />He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to the<br />Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the<br />Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.<br /><br />Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}<br /><br />With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera Chola<br />ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the Malaiyaman<br />king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamathevi yar and<br />also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to the<br />former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.<br /><br />During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by<br />Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara Ravi<br />Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi Varma ?<br />1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the present<br />Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the Kudamalainadu,<br />Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in the<br />Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period.<br /><br />Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}<br /><br />After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave way<br />to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being<br />his paternal uncle to rule for some period.<br /><br />Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar who<br />was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as Kandan<br />Sundera Cholan.<br /><br />Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}<br /><br />Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the heir<br />apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D. 985-1014} on the Chola throne.<br /><br />Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king of<br />Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as<br />Thiribhuvanamadevi.<br /><br />One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the king<br />of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of Thirutchirappalli<br />bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest<br />emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was born.<br /><br />With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and with<br />his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was<br />necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.<br /><br />During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai<br />which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />trained warriors.<br /><br />Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera(Kerala)<br />country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of<br />the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull kings.<br /><br />Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again<br />in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military<br />acadamy and arsenal centre.<br /><br />This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the<br />year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military<br />acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam.<br /><br />The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu & Valluvanadu. The Rajaraja<br />Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).<br /><br />Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in the<br />year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi (October/November)<br />a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the God at<br />the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a<br />perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.<br /><br />He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in the<br />Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the present<br />Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador to the<br />co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from<br />Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely Baskara<br />Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras,<br />requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes.<br /><br />The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of Uthahai<br />and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 who<br />sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014<br />which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears Baskara<br />Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by Cholas.<br /><br />The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north and<br />central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman<br />Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />(Kodungolur) . It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the<br />Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the<br />Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories of<br />Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under Baskara<br />Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.<br /><br />The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory (Kolladesam)<br />and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the Kollam<br />(proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain Govardhana<br />Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.<br /><br />Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}<br /><br />Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by<br />his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.<br /><br />During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, with<br />the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of<br />Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his second<br />son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who defeated<br />the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital Mahothai<br />and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu<br />belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In this war<br />Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.<br /><br />With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1<br />assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave the<br />title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and appointed<br />him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of the<br />Kerala country.<br /><br />However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition<br />with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera country<br />in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />{A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting the<br />Chola suzerainty.<br /><br />Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his<br />father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at Jayamaliswarem<br />in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village<br />named Chola-Kerala Nallur.<br /><br />Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a<br />statue of herself and installed at the temple known as Sembianmathevi<br />at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri Lanka<br />too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.<br /><br />Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter of<br />the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name Vananvanmadevi<br />daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.<br /><br />Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />Gangaikondasolapura m west of present Chidambaram and there he built<br />his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" commemorating<br />his victory over Kerala kings.<br /><br />Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}<br /><br />With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son the<br />Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of<br />Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When he<br />ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the<br />Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.<br /><br />During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at<br />Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which first<br />proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam.<br /><br />He appointed Rajasimhan{1028- 1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the<br />Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who continued<br />to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly<br />relations with them for some time.<br /><br />This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at<br />Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king<br />Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. Rajendra<br />Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042<br /><br />Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at Mannar<br />Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the Chera<br />king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />Vinnagar Alvar.<br /><br />Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started agitating<br />for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of the<br />region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to<br />Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom to<br />the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja' s forces<br />further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that became<br />active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated Vilignam<br />which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, and<br />was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.<br /><br />However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting the<br />suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha was<br />followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera throne.<br /><br />Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}<br /><br />In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field at<br />Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2{A.D.1051-<br />1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from A.D.1051,<br />crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and continued<br />with the war with success to Cholas.<br /><br />During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola Keralan<br />in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same title<br />as Chola Keralan.<br /><br />Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}<br /><br />With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063- 1070} was<br />crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the<br />Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started<br />agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra first<br />sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the<br />Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped from his<br />country.<br /><br />Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? 2,<br />it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war expedition<br />to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and<br />Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The<br />Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating<br />the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and<br />maids.<br /><br />Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}<br /><br />With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{ A.D1070-1074}<br />succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-regent<br />from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of few<br />months due to illness.<br /><br />During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />Athirajathirajadeve r who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling<br />from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.<br /><br />Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}<br /><br />After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the Chola<br />country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja<br />Chola ? 1 to succeed.<br /><br />Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to the<br />chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the<br />year A.D.1074.<br /><br />Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera<br />kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom from<br />from the Chola kings.<br /><br />Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He<br />captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of Kumari<br />all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate king<br />and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a<br />nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the<br />general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.<br /><br />Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces<br />(suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in<br />this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma {A.D.1082-<br />1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas.<br /><br />He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama Varma<br />Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and<br />regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga Chola ? 1<br />didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of the<br />Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 years of<br />intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.<br /><br />The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-Chera<br />conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing<br />Cholas upto A.D.1250<br /><br />------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage.
