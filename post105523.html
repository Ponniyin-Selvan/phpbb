			<div class="content">I disagree that the egmore building was a 'better landmark'. Kalki <br />Gardens was the cradle of the freedom movement in southern India. If <br />the government can preserve Jinnah's house they could not step in <br />and save this building for the future generations of south indian <br />art, music lovers and patriots? Generally though we rarely get <br />government support, I know more people who were furious at <br />Sadasivam's decision to sell/demolish the building than they were <br />with the government.<br /><br />Yes the revenue was kalki magazine which was down to nothing and MSS <br />music royalties.

Generally<br />  though<br />      we rarely get<br />        government support, I know more people who<br />  were<br />      furious at<br />        Sadasivam&#39;s decision to sell/demolish the<br />  building<br />      than they were<br />        with the government.<br />       <br />        Yes the revenue was kalki magazine which was<br />  down<br />      to nothing and<br />      MSS<br />        music royalties. But even during those times<br />  he<br />      had a compulsive<br />        need for charity ,would give away full concert<br />      amounts written away<br />        to charitable institutions. At one private<br />  concert<br />      the patron<br />        himself said he had to request them to accept<br />      airfare, or that<br />      would<br />        be donated too!!<br />       <br />        There were any number of ways MSS&#39;s music<br />  talent<br />      alone could have<br />        saved the great building. Noone questioned her<br />      unwavering<br />      commitment<br />        to charity. But at that time many people were<br />      really questioning<br />        charity at what cost - she had little to say<br />  of<br />      course, she only<br />        followed him and she was the kindest,<br />  humblest,<br />      sweetest human<br />      being<br />        you ever wanted to meet. It was not the same<br />  of<br />      her counterpart.<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />      "R.venketesh"<br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          .
