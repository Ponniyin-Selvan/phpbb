			<div class="content">We can also list the contributories who build the tamil & tamilnadu.<br />I will start with<br /><br />1) Builder of 'Veeranam lake'.<br />2) Our great Chola kings who developed rich culture.<br /><br />"Shanmugam, Kamalakkannan (MLODC, Covansys - CHENNAI)"  wrote:<br /><br />**************<br />The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br />**************<br /><br />This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.<br /><br />Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.<br /><br />Sorry to post an irrelevant message to the group.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br />ADI Support<br />*(91-44-22623880 # 6736)<br />*kshanmug@...<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@...]<br />Sent: Monday, November 08, 2004 12:47 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Niranjan,<br /><br />Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her<br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so<br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will<br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India.<br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we<br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you<br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to<br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending<br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during<br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our<br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita,<br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about<br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi'<br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions<br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should<br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the<br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool<br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br /><br />As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never<br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against<br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want<br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a<br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it<br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000<br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our<br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the<br />media which does this for their benefit.<br /><br />All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the<br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> at the Ayodhya<br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news<br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in<br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for<br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed<br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the<br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They<br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and<br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang<br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that<br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It<br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been<br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a<br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make<br />the news transparent?<br /><br />Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage<br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I<br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have<br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious<br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If<br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right.<br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best<br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra<br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were<br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and<br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a<br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the<br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create<br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The<br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three<br />weeks back from the police custody.<br /><br />The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated<br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by<br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and<br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt<br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even<br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and<br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest<br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group<br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can<br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal<br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in<br />the official published prints.<br /><br />The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating<br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might<br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished,<br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple.<br /><br />Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by<br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write<br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them.<br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to<br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I<br />write in this group.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Kamal,<br /><br />Can you please inform me the reason for the 'Poonool aruppu porattam' against the brahmins? Any genuine reasons for the same. I agree that Brahmins went too far as far as untouchability is concerned. But Bharathi himself being one, was against this. For others I can say its a case of sour grape and cheap publicity.<br /><br />Leave the Brahmins, has all the other castes intermingled with each other. So whats the reason that only the Brahmins were targeted. Had it been any other caste, then probably that would have been the end of their life. Since it was Brahmins, they opted not for violence.<br /><br />This is just like the concept of secularism of our so called leaders in our state.<br /><br />"Shanmugam, Kamalakkannan (MLODC, Covansys - CHENNAI)"  wrote:<br /><br />**************<br />The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br />**************<br /><br />This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.<br /><br />Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.<br /><br />Sorry to post an irrelevant message to the group.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br />ADI Support<br />*(91-44-22623880 # 6736)<br />*kshanmug@...<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@...]<br />Sent: Monday, November 08, 2004 12:47 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Niranjan,<br /><br />Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her<br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so<br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will<br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India.<br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we<br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you<br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to<br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending<br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during<br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our<br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita,<br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about<br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi'<br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions<br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should<br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the<br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool<br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br /><br />As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never<br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against<br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want<br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a<br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it<br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000<br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our<br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the<br />media which does this for their benefit.<br /><br />All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the<br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> at the Ayodhya<br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news<br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in<br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for<br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed<br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the<br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They<br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and<br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang<br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that<br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It<br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been<br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a<br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make<br />the news transparent?<br /><br />Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage<br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I<br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have<br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious<br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If<br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right.<br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best<br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra<br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were<br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and<br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a<br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the<br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create<br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The<br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three<br />weeks back from the police custody.<br /><br />The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated<br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by<br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and<br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt<br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even<br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and<br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest<br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group<br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can<br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal<br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in<br />the official published prints.<br /><br />The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating<br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might<br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished,<br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple.<br /><br />Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by<br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write<br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them.<br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to<br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I<br />write in this group.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Ananth,<br /><br />If we start talking about the politicians and the so called<br />seculars,theres no end to it. We all know they are hipocrats. I<br />though that we are deviating from the topic and SPS has spelt it out.<br />So I stopped at that. What you say is 100% correct and I too voiced<br />the same concern. Though Kamal gave some instances of Periyars words<br />on Christians and Muslims, I think those are very limited. All<br />these 'seculars' target only the Hindus and especially the Brahmins.<br />Because again as I already said, Hindus are very tolerant and wont<br />protest for anything. I think lets put a fullstop here and get back<br />to our glorious past. Recent history is not glorious in any aspect.<br /><br />Just another titbit..Dont know how far its true..I heard it from very<br />genuine people who are ardent tamil scholars or marabilakiya fanatics<br />and hence assume its true.....after 1975 or so (somewhere in the mid<br />of 70's) no Brahmin has got a Ph.D in Tamil, because no guide of<br />Tamil accepts a Brahmin student as a research scholar under him/her.<br />Courtesy, DK movement. They feel Brahmins dominate in all fields and<br />dont want them to shine in Tamil literature.

			<div class="content">HI Satish,<br />Everyone has the right to know about the TRUE history and not distorted<br />figures. But at the same time, what we learn should not create hate<br />against others.<br />Agreed, Moghuls destroyed a lot of temples. At this age of 25+, when we<br />learn about it, we have enough wisdom to digest that fact. My blood<br />boiled when I read vanthaarkaL venRaakaL. But just imagine, at a tender<br />age of 11-15 when we are taught that Moghul rulers destroyed all<br />temples, DK movement unleashed a hate against Brahmins etc etc. won't it<br />create a feeling of hatred against them. It sows a seed of hate in your<br />heart, which can never be plucked out. And imagine you have a good<br />friend, who is a muslim and when you 2 study the same TRUE history in<br />school, won't you have a feeling of hatred against him as well.  <br />As such, the Indian community is divided, thanks to the bitter caste<br />politics and reservation. Do we want to create more division by<br />preaching the dark ages of the history.<br />Agreed literary works like kamba Ramayanam, Thiruvaasakaam, Thevaram<br />etc. were not given so much importance like the silappathikaaram etc.<br />But interested people can always learn that and do research on them.<br />There is no dearth of topic in history to be researched upon. <br />If we have learnt about Shah Jahan as a person, who built Taj Mahal, so<br />be it. Let us have good and optimistic opinion about him. Instead of<br />remembering him as a guy who never allowed construction of a single<br />temple across him empire. So whatever history we have learnt, let us say<br />is TRUE, if not COMPLETE.<br /><br />Anbudan,<br />Vijay</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by Thangaprakash  using id thangaprakash_t</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />the mass and media r with evr and the likes becos he worked for the masses. hardly my grannys generation knows abt bharati r rajaji r kalki becos their work was limited in a small circle. i dont think anybody worship periyar but many among the older generation revere him for wat he did for them. people like me r talkin here becos of periyar. but the same cannot said of todays politicians.<br /><br />niranjan parameswaran  wrote:Its true Kamal. But, you know if somebody worshiped like "the only great soul" who brought pahutharivu and vilippunarchi, then people who knows little more about history will definitely provoke that.<br /><br />Points of Sathish are just like that.<br /><br />By giving much biased worship to EVK, we forget services of Subramania siva, Swaminathan, Bharathiar, CHithambaram, Rajaji and Kalki and many more are there who sacrificed their life for this Tamil & Tamil nadu. We easiliy avoiding/forget them. You know why? the media and mass are with them. They grow hatred. They divide the people for their political gain.<br /><br />Sathishs views are understandablr. Its not kind of hatred. And in the same time you are also correct.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"Shanmugam, Kamalakkannan (MLODC, Covansys - CHENNAI)"  wrote:<br /><br />**************<br />The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br />**************<br /><br />This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.<br /><br />Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.<br /><br />Sorry to post an irrelevant message to the group.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br />ADI Support<br />*(91-44-22623880 # 6736)<br />*kshanmug@...<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@...]<br />Sent: Monday, November 08, 2004 12:47 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Niranjan,<br /><br />Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her<br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so<br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will<br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India.<br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we<br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you<br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to<br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending<br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during<br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our<br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita,<br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about<br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi'<br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions<br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should<br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the<br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool<br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who<br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for<br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out<br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the<br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I<br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands<br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or<br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any<br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the<br />procession.<br /><br />As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never<br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against<br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want<br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a<br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it<br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000<br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our<br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the<br />media which does this for their benefit.<br /><br />All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the<br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> at the Ayodhya<br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news<br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in<br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for<br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed<br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the<br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They<br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and<br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang<br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that<br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It<br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been<br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a<br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make<br />the news transparent?<br /><br />Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage<br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I<br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have<br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious<br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If<br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right.<br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best<br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra<br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were<br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and<br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a<br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the<br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create<br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The<br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three<br />weeks back from the police custody.<br /><br />The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated<br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by<br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and<br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt<br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even<br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and<br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest<br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group<br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can<br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal<br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in<br />the official published prints.<br /><br />The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating<br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might<br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished,<br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple.<br /><br />Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by<br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write<br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them.<br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to<br />get corrected.
