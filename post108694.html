			<div class="content">Ah..Ravi, you have to really befriend and talk to people for all those things to come out. I mean nobody will walk upto you and ask like that. If you be friends for a while you can understand what they know, which is often times downright stupid ideas. I have lived up north too, generally am of the opinion that the average american's knowledge of other countries and cultures is a little pathetic - I don't mean exceptions like our Kathy here. <br />Â <br />More often than not it is ignorance, I mean how many indians have ignorant ideas about western culture, same way. But one does get more upset because the avenues for seeking and learning in this country are way way better than in India, so really there is no excuse for ignorance other than that people don't want to learn.<br /><br />--- On Tue, 8/12/08, Ravi  wrote: <br /><br />From: Ravi <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Gold Medal<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Tuesday, August 12, 2008, 10:23 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malathi, I have been here for a decade but yet to meet any one who <br />ask such questions. <br />I believe there is a divide in the regions also in the US which makes <br />some people totally ignorant of oher geo's.

Though globalization has <br />brought<br />  the world closer, i thought this is a noble gesture. Whether you<br />  accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I mentioned, our<br />  own country men do not say &#39;vande mataram&#39; - i salute my motherland<br />  and there was a huge protest for this. <br />  <br />  Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago religious<br />  conference, just for 6 words..&#39;my brothers and sisters of america&#39;. <br />As<br />  far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal <br />brotherhood<br />  and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />  standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part of the<br />  game and no one would have noticed.<br />  <br />  Our scriptures say,&#39;vasudeva kudumbakam&#39; - the entire human race is<br />  vasudeva&#39;s &#40;krishna/vishnu&#41; family, meaning all are brothers and<br />  sisters and there should be love and no hatred.<br />  <br />  So when Kathie said &#39;Jai Hind&#39;, it gave me a pleasant feeling and at<br />  the same time pain &#40;for the &#39;vande mataram&#39; incident&#41;. I thought <br />its a<br />  good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. <br />  <br />  Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian&#39;s and Indian politicians<br />  make a mockery of our country/system &#40;you even elaborated on the<br />  sports system&#41; an american saying &#39;Jai Hind&#39;....I am moved.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Yes it is true that it varies around the country and also that it is a new country and so on. Also with globalisation more people travel especailly inIT and find out what it is like for themselves, of course travel it self does not mean a broadened mind but it is one way to develop one.<br />Â <br />I believe it is one of the issues with capitalism - that thrives on people making quick and less informed choices. I am not talking of some farmer in Kentucky having ignorant ideas, it is educated people, degree holders - later on I learnt most colored people, not just indians face the same, stereotyped ideas and racist ignorance. <br />Â <br />I don't want to disregard the fact that us indians many times hold stereotyped ideas all the time (I have met several racist indians who think their american neighbor is racist but have no problems addressing an african american 'kallu' or having stereotyped ideas about them. But am not sure we are known to be a liberal country either, our prejudices are centuries old and we inherited most of them. It is sad to see the degree of ignorance in a country that is a melting pot of so many cutlures and has little by way of prejudiced baggage (comparatively that is).<br />--- On Wed, 8/13/08, Ravi  wrote: <br /><br />From: Ravi <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Gold Medal<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, August 13, 2008, 7:12 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well there are ignorant people across the globe, infact, america is a <br />new country,it is normal to have people less concerned about outside <br />geo's, it is more or less like 'enna valam illai intha thiru naatil'.<br />America sources itself, like how India was.<br /><br />And Malathi, I have a lot of very close american friends,but all are <br />in IT, may be that could be a fun stopper <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Katherine Brobeck <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear friends,<br />  I don&#39;t think you can generalize about American regions.<br />  It all depends on a person&#39;s education, I think.

			<div class="content">Malathi, you struck a chord there. I lived in US for about 8 years. <br />Mostly in LA(3 years) and in Omaha, Des Moines, Scranton, Greenville <br />and Atlanta(about a year each in these places). My general <br />observation is that people in the mid-west and the south were <br />culturally conservative but were most fun. I was invited for thanks <br />giving dinner in Omaha, Greenville and Des moines by different <br />people. Given that usually the family congregates for thanks giving, <br />I think the gesture made was more than just symbolic. I was living <br />alone in LA before I got married and moved to Iowa. My wife remember <br />the Iowa/South Carolina/Penn days as the best as she made a lot of <br />friends in the apartment community we were living. <br />That said, when we enrolled our son in a local catholic school for <br />his pre-kindergarden, thats when we noticed that my son was not very <br />happy about school and had problems moving with other kids in <br />school. His only friend was a Indian girl in his class. <br />Though we got our green cards by that time, we decided to move out <br />and settle back in Chennai for his sake as much as our sake. Its <br />been 2 years since, I dont know whether it was a right decision or <br />not but I am seeing my son having more friends and more importantly <br />for me, he now is more closer to his cousins and is happy to go to <br />school(I mean, he really likes his school). <br />May be, its just that I panicked but I think I made the right <br />decision to come back. I am planning to settle down back in Madurai <br />may be in another 10 years time. <br />Like I was telling my friends here, I was chasing the dream of <br />leaving Madurai and landing in United states for the first 22 years <br />of my life and now I am chasing the dream of settling back in <br />Madurai for the past 11 years and hopefully will do that in another <br />10-11 years.

			<div class="content">Muthu, am sure you and your wife did what was right for your child, according to your priorities. I wish more indians would admit what is important tothem and do the same instead of making excuses such as needing more money,or raising kids 'indian' and so on. I have no issues with people raising their kids abroad as long as they understand what the child goes through, and provide for some outlet for the child's needs for community and companionship. Wealthy gujarati and some telugu families are able to do that since they are large communities settled together. <br />Â <br />Children grow up in india with family ties, granted increased modernizationhas perhaps taken away some old values but still no drugs, no promiscuity,and no guns in school. A lot to be grateful for (I think). Am also reminded of Thoreau's quote at the end of the journey we come back to where we started and begin all over again (or something like that).<br />Â <br />Bests<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Wed, 8/13/08, Muthu Prakash R  wrote: <br /><br />From: Muthu Prakash R <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Gold Medal<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, August 13, 2008, 8:14 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malathi, you struck a chord there. I lived in US for about 8 years. <br />Mostly in LA(3 years) and in Omaha, Des Moines, Scranton, Greenville <br />and Atlanta(about a year each in these places). My general <br />observation is that people in the mid-west and the south were <br />culturally conservative but were most fun. I was invited for thanks <br />giving dinner in Omaha, Greenville and Des moines by different <br />people. Given that usually the family congregates for thanks giving, <br />I think the gesture made was more than just symbolic. I was living <br />alone in LA before I got married and moved to Iowa. My wife remember <br />the Iowa/South Carolina/Penn days as the best as she made a lot of <br />friends in the apartment community we were living. <br />That said, when we enrolled our son in a local catholic school for <br />his pre-kindergarden, thats when we noticed that my son was not very <br />happy about school and had problems moving with other kids in <br />school. His only friend was a Indian girl in his class. <br />Though we got our green cards by that time, we decided to move out <br />and settle back in Chennai for his sake as much as our sake. Its <br />been 2 years since, I dont know whether it was a right decision or <br />not but I am seeing my son having more friends and more importantly <br />for me, he now is more closer to his cousins and is happy to go to <br />school(I mean, he really likes his school). <br />May be, its just that I panicked but I think I made the right <br />decision to come back. I am planning to settle down back in Madurai <br />may be in another 10 years time. <br />Like I was telling my friends here, I was chasing the dream of <br />leaving Madurai and landing in United states for the first 22 years <br />of my life and now I am chasing the dream of settling back in <br />Madurai for the past 11 years and hopefully will do that in another <br />10-11 years. Life is crazy, aint it?<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot">http://sibipranav.blogspot</a><!-- m -->. com<br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Venkat, yes it does everywhere.

The majority of immigrant parents do not think <br />deeply about raising kids in another culture, they just 'settle <br />down' because they got their green cards and life is indeed cleaner <br />and more comfortable. When children grow up they are shocked because <br />for all reasons children speak in a completely alien accent, cannot <br />communicate with grandparents or cousins in India, and do not share <br />their own sentiments on our culture. Let us face it, cultures are <br />differnt. Although we want a 'vasudeva kudumbakam' we often come <br />face to face with totally different ways of living, almost like <br />people are from a different plant. Immigrant children who run into <br />such differences chooose 'their planet' that is the land they are <br />in, for survival more than anything else. It is immature to think <br />they are 'indians' in the literal<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>sense of the word although many do seek a connection and <br />community back home especially after they are older.<br />  Â <br />  Malathi<br />  --- On Tue, 8/12/08, R.venketesh  wrote: <br />  <br />  From: R.venketesh <br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Gold Medal<br />  To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />  Date: Tuesday, August 12, 2008, 8:22 PM<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Hi<br />  <br />  malathi&#39;s observations do give us an insight into the problems <br />faced <br />  by immigrants.<br />  malathi, does this isolation also happen at university levels?<br />  <br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Please let us show some degree of caution while labelling <br />american <br />  indians as indians or for that matter all people of indian origin <br />as <br />  indians. I have learnt this the hard way believe me. Deepak Chopra <br />  once made a controversial statement that he was not a Hindu &#40;after <br />  adopting and explaining several hindu practices and making <br />millions <br />  of $&#41;. In the same fashion several american indians completely <br />disown <br />  their origins.

As I <br />mentioned, <br />    our<br />      own country men do not say &#39;vande mataram&#39; - i salute my <br />  motherland<br />      and there was a huge protest for this. <br />      <br />      Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago <br />religious<br />      conference, just for 6 words..&#39;my brothers and sisters of <br />  america&#39;. <br />    As<br />      far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal <br />    brotherhood<br />      and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />      standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part <br />of <br />  the<br />      game and no one would have noticed.<br />      <br />      Our scriptures say,&#39;vasudeva kudumbakam&#39; - the entire human <br />race <br />  is<br />      vasudeva&#39;s &#40;krishna/vishnu&#41; family, meaning all are brothers <br />and<br />      sisters and there should be love and no hatred.<br />      <br />      So when Kathie said &#39;Jai Hind&#39;, it gave me a pleasant feeling <br />and <br />  at<br />      the same time pain &#40;for the &#39;vande mataram&#39; incident&#41;. I <br />thought <br />    its a<br />      good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. <br />      <br />      Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian&#39;s and Indian <br />politicians<br />      make a mockery of our country/system &#40;you even elaborated on <br />the<br />      sports system&#41; an american saying &#39;Jai Hind&#39;....I am moved.<br />      <br />      Regards,<br />      Satish</div></blockquote></div>
