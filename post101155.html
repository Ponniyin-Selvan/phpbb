			<div class="content">dear arun<br /><br />will def dig out literary evidence for your querry over the week but<br /><br />before that a few posers:<br /><br />did you learn to walk, run and talk the day you were born...can a <br />novice sculpture come up with a magnificiant yakshi just by hemself -<br />obviously there is a long learning process before you master <br />anything. Tamils masterpieces are proof of the existence of a highly <br />evolved culture - can you come up with something as comprehensive a <br />tirukural over night.<br /><br />some questions to you - am picking related strings to this sites <br />overall content to keep the interests of all viewers - <br /><br />Have you been to mamallapuram - if you look around you will see <br />wierd rows of small holes in the granite blocks around..every <br />realised why they are there ...<br /><br />talking of stone - look at the architecture in the big temple - how <br />the load is distributed over the walls and then on to the base <br />platform - else inorder to go high ( big) they would have had to go <br />down similar to lay the foundations...see how the blocks fit to the <br />next blocks - like a grid/puzzle. <br /><br />Sidha medicine<br />The Siddha system of medicine owes its origin to the Dravidian <br />culture which is of the Pre-vedic period. An examination of the <br />ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed <br />allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the phallus <br />(linga) which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated into the <br />Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical <br />counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly <br />therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman, white, <br />yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as vegatable <br />poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the Siddha <br />tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the <br />Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, where <br />the Dravidian civilization was document.<br /><br /><br />The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the sub-<br />continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as ancient <br />as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic study <br />of nature and its elements and from what they were able to grasp, <br />they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is now known <br />as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles of <br />nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study of the <br />human system. <br /><br />The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for <br />longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery over <br />nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through medicines. The <br />people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves great <br />yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine propounded by <br />them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This system <br />can be traced to the prevedic period.<br /><br />Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? means <br />perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to eight <br />kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons who had <br />attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The persons who <br />had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as Siddhars. <br />They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of years <br />ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for truth, <br />avhieved perfection in their life time. <br /><br />Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of <br />medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm <br />Literature which are believed to have been written thousands of <br />years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500 works in <br />Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life, nature <br />of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory, space <br />travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc. <br /><br />The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohenjo-daro <br />Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of <br />Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as found a <br />place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has been <br />used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for smallpox and <br />other infectious diseases and also considered to possess powers to <br />ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the germicidal <br />action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, Tirumular, the <br />great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several <br />thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss under a <br />sacred pipal tree. <br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi VJ,<br />  <br />  Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts written in <br />the<br />  southern part of India.

This Sangam lasted for<br />    3700 years and had 3700 poets participating. This city also<br />    submerged in sea.

			<div class="content">Hi, anyone on the group can assist with verifying below - <br /><br />Indian alchemists specially of Tamil Nadu, knew the distinction <br />between the transmuted ?gold? and the real one. A Tamil text <br />(Amudakalaijnanam by Agastya) states clearly that if the artificial ?<br />gold? and the natural gold are separately subjected to prolonged <br />heating or calcination, the former gives out ashes and the real face <br />of the metal appears, while the natural gold remains uneffected by <br />this method.<br /><br />vj<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear arun<br />  <br />  will def dig out literary evidence for your querry over the week <br />but<br />  <br />  before that a few posers:<br />  <br />  did you learn to walk, run and talk the day you were born...can a <br />  novice sculpture come up with a magnificiant yakshi just by <br />hemself -<br />  obviously there is a long learning process before you master <br />  anything.

An examination of the <br />  ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed <br />  allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the phallus <br />  &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated into the <br />  Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical <br />  counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly <br />  therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman, white, <br />  yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as vegatable <br />  poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the Siddha <br />  tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the <br />  Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, <br />where <br />  the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />  <br />  <br />  The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the sub-<br />  continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as <br />ancient <br />  as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic <br />study <br />  of nature and its elements and from what they were able to grasp, <br />  they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is now <br />known <br />  as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles of <br />  nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study of the <br />  human system. <br />  <br />  The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for <br />  longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery over <br />  nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through medicines. <br />The <br />  people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves great <br />  yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine propounded <br />by <br />  them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This system <br />  can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />  <br />  Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? means <br />  perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to eight <br />  kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons who <br />had <br />  attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The persons who <br />  had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as Siddhars. <br />  They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of years <br />  ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for truth, <br />  avhieved perfection in their life time. <br />  <br />  Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of <br />  medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />  Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm <br />  Literature which are believed to have been written thousands of <br />  years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500 works <br />in <br />  Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life, <br />nature <br />  of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory, space <br />  travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc. <br />  <br />  The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohenjo-<br />daro <br />  Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of <br />  Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as found a <br />  place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has <br />been <br />  used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for smallpox <br />and <br />  other infectious diseases and also considered to possess powers to <br />  ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the germicidal <br />  action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, Tirumular, the <br />  great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several <br />  thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss under <br />a <br />  sacred pipal tree. <br />  <br />  vj<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi VJ,<br />    <br />    Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts written <br />in <br />  the<br />    southern part of India.

			<div class="content">Dear Sri,<br /><br />Assuming that is true and that in a more caste-based society, learning was<br />in the hands of only a certain caste, that could be an indicator of<br />why there are no tamil texts on science.

Again, if your contention is that it was the<br />    kings who decided, then sure, I can go with that...so Sanskrit was then<br />    language of science in India. Or was it?

The<br />      second Sangam was convened in Kapatapuram, which finds mention in<br />      Valmiki Ramayana &#40;Kishkinda Kanda 42:13&#41;. This Sangam lasted for<br />      3700 years and had 3700 poets participating. This city also<br />      submerged in sea.

Tamils masterpieces are proof of the existence of a highly<br />evolved culture - can you come up with something as comprehensive a<br />tirukural over night.<br /><br />I never said that Tamizh culture was not well developed... The fact that<br />tamizh literary masterpieces were written<br />is all the more reason for this HUGE void in terms of the nonexistence of<br />scientific works in our language.<br />Again, for all the examples you have provided, I don't doubt that there<br />might be a scientific basis to it. However, my<br />original question dealt with the lack of any texts in our language. Why was<br />it? Lack of patronage for men of science unlike<br />for the "pulavars"? Obviously, if it is not a paying job, people might not<br />gravitate towards it. I have no idea.. I don't know the answers. Just that<br />this is something that needs to be acknowledged and discussed.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br />On 6/4/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear arun<br /> <br />  will def dig out literary evidence for your querry over the week but<br /> <br />  before that a few posers:<br /> <br />  did you learn to walk, run and talk the day you were born...can a<br />  novice sculpture come up with a magnificiant yakshi just by hemself -<br />  obviously there is a long learning process before you master<br />  anything.

An examination of the<br />  ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />  allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the phallus<br />  &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated into the<br />  Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical<br />  counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly<br />  therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman, white,<br />  yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as vegatable<br />  poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the Siddha<br />  tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the<br />  Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, where<br />  the Dravidian civilization was document.<br /> <br />  The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the sub-<br />  continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as ancient<br />  as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic study<br />  of nature and its elements and from what they were able to grasp,<br />  they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is now known<br />  as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles of<br />  nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study of the<br />  human system.<br /> <br />  The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for<br />  longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery over<br />  nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through medicines. The<br />  people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves great<br />  yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine propounded by<br />  them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This system<br />  can be traced to the prevedic period.<br /> <br />  Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? means<br />  perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to eight<br />  kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons who had<br />  attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The persons who<br />  had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as Siddhars.<br />  They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of years<br />  ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for truth,<br />  avhieved perfection in their life time.<br /> <br />  Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of<br />  medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />  Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm<br />  Literature which are believed to have been written thousands of<br />  years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500 works in<br />  Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life, nature<br />  of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory, space<br />  travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br /> <br />  The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohenjo-daro<br />  Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of<br />  Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as found a<br />  place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has been<br />  used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for smallpox and<br />  other infectious diseases and also considered to possess powers to<br />  ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the germicidal<br />  action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, Tirumular, the<br />  great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several<br />  thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss under a<br />  sacred pipal tree.<br /> <br />  vj<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Arun Krishnan"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi VJ,<br />   <br />    Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts written in<br />  the<br />    southern part of India.

			<div class="content">dude, now you are talking in the right tone - what do you mean by <br />scientific work - half of europe went mad with alchemists claiming <br />to convert junk to gold and then an other half went burning these. <br />is this science. journals and thesises do not make up science. you <br />are talking of a culture who were dwelling into the depths of the <br />atom ( anu) when half of europe were shitting in the open and  <br />wiping these asses with grass - a culture that could think of the <br />universe as cyclical ( nadi josiyam stems from this belief - but <br />again these works were in sanskrit and thanks to chola kings they <br />were translated to tamil) and are alive to this day.<br /><br />My grandfather knew the mankanakku tables ( fraction tables - kal, <br />arikal) thought by word of mouth in form of jingles - and b've me he <br />could beat you hands down on any calcuation with the latest of <br />machines. <br /><br />Selflessness comes after selfishness. self realisation and godliness <br />follow. Inorder to dwell into something as magnificient as love and <br />bakti you need to have transcended the material world. if you look <br />deeply in buddhism you will see more on this. <br /><br />anyway sometimes its good to rake up a controversial topic to wake <br />up a group but ....masuru, mayiru, mudi,koondal, kesam...etc all <br />may mean the same, but need to be used appropriately...<br /><br />vj<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear VK,<br />  <br />  Please see my replies below:<br />  <br />  You said:<br />  <br />  did you learn to walk, run and talk the day you were born...can a<br />  novice sculpture come up with a magnificiant yakshi just by <br />hemself -<br />  obviously there is a long learning process before you master<br />  anything.

An examination of the<br />    ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />    allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the phallus<br />    &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated into the<br />    Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical<br />    counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly<br />    therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman, <br />white,<br />    yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as vegatable<br />    poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the Siddha<br />    tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the<br />    Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, <br />where<br />    the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />   <br />    The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the sub-<br />    continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as <br />ancient<br />    as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic <br />study<br />    of nature and its elements and from what they were able to grasp,<br />    they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is now <br />known<br />    as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles of<br />    nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study of the<br />    human system.<br />   <br />    The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for<br />    longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery <br />over<br />    nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through medicines. <br />The<br />    people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves <br />great<br />    yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine propounded <br />by<br />    them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This system<br />    can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />   <br />    Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? means<br />    perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to <br />eight<br />    kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons who <br />had<br />    attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The persons <br />who<br />    had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as <br />Siddhars.<br />    They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of years<br />    ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for truth,<br />    avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />   <br />    Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of<br />    medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />    Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm<br />    Literature which are believed to have been written thousands of<br />    years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500 <br />works in<br />    Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life, <br />nature<br />    of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory, <br />space<br />    travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />   <br />    The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohenjo-<br />daro<br />    Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of<br />    Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as found a<br />    place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has <br />been<br />    used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for smallpox <br />and<br />    other infectious diseases and also considered to possess powers <br />to<br />    ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the germicidal<br />    action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, Tirumular, <br />the<br />    great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several<br />    thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss <br />under a<br />    sacred pipal tree.<br />   <br />    vj<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "Arun Krishnan"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      Hi VJ,<br />     <br />      Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts <br />written in<br />    the<br />      southern part of India.

			<div class="content">Dear VK,<br /><br />Am a little confused by this particular post of yours. How does the fact<br />that we (as in Indian science)<br />was more advanced than Europe have anything to do with my original query. I<br />point to a lack of texts in tamizh on<br />the physical sciences. I am trying to figure out the reason for this. The<br />reason could be that since the Brahmins were<br />jealous and zealous guardians of organized knowledge at that point in time,<br />they used Sanskrit for it. Or there could be<br />other cultural reasons.<br /><br />You write,<br /><br />Selflessness comes after selfishness. self realisation and godliness<br />follow. Inorder to dwell into something as magnificient as love and<br />bakti you need to have transcended the material world. if you look<br />deeply in buddhism you will see more on this.<br /><br />I don't see how this is relevant to the point under discussion.<br /><br />You further say<br />anyway sometimes its good to rake up a controversial topic to wake<br />up a group but ....masuru, mayiru, mudi,koondal, kesam...etc all<br />may mean the same, but need to be used appropriately...<br /><br />Have no idea what you meant by that and how it is germane to the issue.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br />On 6/4/07, Vijay Kumar .S  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dude, now you are talking in the right tone - what do you mean by<br />  scientific work - half of europe went mad with alchemists claiming<br />  to convert junk to gold and then an other half went burning these.<br />  is this science. journals and thesises do not make up science. you<br />  are talking of a culture who were dwelling into the depths of the<br />  atom &#40; anu&#41; when half of europe were shitting in the open and<br />  wiping these asses with grass - a culture that could think of the<br />  universe as cyclical &#40; nadi josiyam stems from this belief - but<br />  again these works were in sanskrit and thanks to chola kings they<br />  were translated to tamil&#41; and are alive to this day.<br /> <br />  My grandfather knew the mankanakku tables &#40; fraction tables - kal,<br />  arikal&#41; thought by word of mouth in form of jingles - and b&#39;ve me he<br />  could beat you hands down on any calcuation with the latest of<br />  machines.<br /> <br />  Selflessness comes after selfishness. self realisation and godliness<br />  follow.

However, my<br />    original question dealt with the lack of any texts in our<br />  language. Why was<br />    it? Lack of patronage for men of science unlike<br />    for the "pulavars"? Obviously, if it is not a paying job, people<br />  might not<br />    gravitate towards it. I have no idea..

An examination of the<br />      ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed<br />      allegiance to the cult of Shiva and the worship of the phallus<br />      &#40;linga&#41; which was later on absorbed by, and incorporated into the<br />      Vedic culture. The Shiv Cult is associated with its medical<br />      counterpart, the Siddha system of medicine, which is mainly<br />      therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bituman,<br />  white,<br />      yellow and red arsenic and other materials as well as vegatable<br />      poisons are extensively used in the pharmacopocia of the Siddha<br />      tradition. The Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the<br />      Sourthen States of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore,<br />  where<br />      the Dravidian civilization was document.<br />     <br />      The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the sub-<br />      continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as<br />  ancient<br />      as that of perhaps the Egyptians. They undertook a systematic<br />  study<br />      of nature and its elements and from what they were able to grasp,<br />      they had developed a highly systematised medicine which is now<br />  known<br />      as Siddha system. It is well founded on the basic principles of<br />      nature and its elements offer a careful and thorough study of the<br />      human system.<br />     <br />      The Siddhars :The ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for<br />      longevity developed two ways by which man can achieve mastery<br />  over<br />      nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through medicines.<br />  The<br />      people who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves<br />  great<br />      yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine propounded<br />  by<br />      them came ot be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This system<br />      can be traced to the prevedic period.<br />     <br />      Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ?chit? means<br />      perfection in life or heavenly bliss. It generally refers to<br />  eight<br />      kinds of supernatural powers attainable to man. The persons who<br />  had<br />      attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The persons<br />  who<br />      had attained such miraculous powers in life are known as<br />  Siddhars.<br />      They are men born with great talents who lived thousands of years<br />      ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for truth,<br />      avhieved perfection in their life time.<br />     <br />      Ancient Siddha Medical Works: The earliest mention the use of<br />      medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-<br />      Ennayiram, Tholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm<br />      Literature which are believed to have been written thousands of<br />      years before the Christian era. There are now more than 500<br />  works in<br />      Tamil dealing with various subjects such as science of life,<br />  nature<br />      of universe, astronomical data, cosmic dance, atomic theory,<br />  space<br />      travel, alchemy, ?Kaya Kalpa? medicine, etc.<br />     <br />      The Neem Tree : The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohenjo-<br />  daro<br />      Civilization. In the annals of the ancient Siddha System of<br />      Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as found a<br />      place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has<br />  been<br />      used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent for smallpox<br />  and<br />      other infectious diseases and also considered to possess powers<br />  to<br />      ward off evil spirits. Perhaps they were aware of the germicidal<br />      action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, Tirumular,<br />  the<br />      great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several<br />      thousands of years before the Christian Era in eternal bliss<br />  under a<br />      sacred pipal tree.<br />     <br />      vj<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --> 40yahoogroups.com ,<br />      "Arun Krishnan"<br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        Hi VJ,<br />       <br />        Again, I never said that there were no scientific texts<br />  written in<br />      the<br />        southern part of India.

This Sangam lasted<br />  for<br />          3700 years and had 3700 poets participating. This city also<br />          submerged in sea.

Like Latin was the de facto language<br />  for<br />            science in<br />              Europe?<br />             <br />              Any ideas?<br />             <br />              Cheers,<br />             <br />              Arun<br />             <br />              On 6/2/07, s.balasubramani  wrote:<br />               <br />               <br />                may be useful to some one<br />               <br />               <br />         <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommunication/ResearchJournals/">http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommun ... hJournals/</a><!-- m --><br />            rejou<br />                r/ijtk/ijtk2k5/ijtk_oct05.asp<br />               <br />               <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tnhealth.org/imtmp.htm">http://www.tnhealth.org/imtmp.htm</a><!-- m --><br />               <br />         <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommunication/ResearchJournals/">http://www.niscair.res.in/ScienceCommun ... hJournals/</a><!-- m --><br />            rejou<br />                r/ijtk/ijtk0.asp<br />               <br />               <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ciks.org/aims.htm">http://www.ciks.org/aims.htm</a><!-- m --><br />               <br />               <br />                --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />   40yahoogroups.com <br />           40yahoogroups.com <br />            ,<br />                "R.venketesh"<br />               <br />                 wrote:<br />                 <br />                  Ni<br />                 <br />                  I guess science in india was on par with the world at<br />      every<br />            point<br />                of<br />                  time.especially in architecture and astronomy.<br />                  it was only with the industrial revolution that they<br />      forged<br />            ahead<br />                  of us.<br />                  also individual achievements were well recorded in<br />  the<br />      west<br />                whereas<br />                  they were not here.<br />                  for example da vinci &#40; 1500 ad ???&#41; invented the<br />  tank,<br />      the<br />                submarine,<br />                  and the helicopter and a variety of machines even<br />  before<br />          some<br />            one<br />                  invented the prime mover&#40; the motor}. so they were<br />  of no<br />      use<br />                  davinci invented the parachute before some one<br />  invented<br />      the<br />            plane.<br />                  but the important thing was he recorded it .<br />                 <br />                  venketesh<br />                 <br />                  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />   40yahoogroups.com <br />           40yahoogroups.com <br />            ,<br />                "Arun<br />                  Krishnan"  wrote:<br />                   <br />                    Dear All,<br />                   <br />                    I was watching the "Dharmi" episode<br />      of "Thiruvilayadal" the<br />                other<br />                  day and<br />                    something struck me..
