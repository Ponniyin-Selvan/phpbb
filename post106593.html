			<div class="content">The work with archeology is commendable and the article is <br />impressive. <br /><br />To start, there is a quote in Kandar Anubuthi<br />"Yaam odhiya kalviyum, yem arivum, thaame pera velavar thandathanaal,<br />Poo mel mayal poi, arra mei punarvir namir nadaveer nadaver iniye<br />In short (It would take atleas 2 pages to explain these two lines in <br />detail): <br />The knowledge we get imparted by ur curiosity, books, learning is <br />what Lord Muruga gives. True knowledge is what we get on uttering the <br />Name of the Lord. That is obtained by breaking the shield of worldly <br />knowledge (poo mel mayal poi - arra mei punarvir).<br /><br />The history of Lord muruga from sangam - as per the article is like <br />identifying the million piece puzzle game with two or three units. <br /><br />Strictly going by the article, I would like to question the basics of <br />their thought process. Killing God ? Muruku means youthful splendor. <br />Before going further, I would tell one more information on the <br />difference between Skanda and Palani andavar. Each are a version of <br />the Paramaatma at diffrent times and different planes and different <br />needs of Karma balances. He is stated as Velakkara kadavul as he <br />vouches the protect the devotee at any cost. In fact, if you observe <br />well, he has not killed even Sooran. Murugan sooranai 'thaduthu <br />aatkondan'.<br /><br />We have learned to read and see things sequentially that we fail to <br />understand the parallel words or existances or the time differences <br />etc. <br /><br />Skanda as Devasenapathi was one such form of the Lord Almighty, that <br />form he took to equate Suran. It has no relation to the Palani <br />andavar or Vayalur murugan or so on so forth. Each one is an avatar <br />and each one has a different purpose, they all are the base <br />paramatma. Muruganai pol santha swaroopiyum illai, skandanai pol <br />akrosham kondvarum illai. No wonder, many people in north who pray <br />Karthikeya do not know the existance of Valli amma, this avatar is <br />only here in our backyard.<br /><br />The article however brings to light some interesting aspects on the <br />sangam and other parts that point me to lean that the base for the <br />writing comes from Ceylon. Kathirgamam is the place where Aruva <br />vazhibadu happens today, according to legend, Brahma took the form of <br />a hunter and prayed to the Lord. <br />Quote here: Thirupugazh Song 'Aharamum aagi Athibanum aagi',Location: <br />Palamuthir solai: <br />"Vana murai vedan aruliya poosai , magizh kathir kaamam udayone"<br />Hunters , spirit of forest and God of Love - fertility whatever <br />(Kamam), these are purely related to Kathir Kamam.<br /><br />Also, I would be curious to know the mood of the person researching <br />the colors of Mayon and Murugavel. Black and Red with anger ? How <br />about this line of thought, the early morning dawn afer a dark night? <br />The dawn is symbolized by the sounding of a Cock and the Darkness is <br />needed to see the dawn, they do not exist without each other. Irul <br />illamal oli illai, Maal illamal Mal marukan illai, both darkness and <br />light are the forms of the same entity. Irulai irul aaki oliyai <br />tharuvaan. <br /><br />I personally think it is ignorance to classify the Lord of Knowledge <br />to domestication of cock and primitive thoughts on peacock or <br />elephant. Going by this scale, how would we explain a hayagreeva or <br />moshika vaahanan? <br /><br />The history of the Lord's worship (relationship) with mankind cannot <br />be traced thus, it would be like measuring the ocean with a foot <br />scale. We are not even in a stage to figure out where is the resting <br />place of the great king who walked our country, we definitely do not <br />have the capacity to speculate on the ever living beyond the concept <br />of 'time'.<br /><br />Long story short - Rishi moolam - nadhi moolam ....<br /><br />-- Murugan adimai<br />-- Ravi <br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I have written an essay detailing the history of Murugan form Pre<br />  historic times to Sangam era.<br />  Please read it and comment about the work.<br />  <br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a><!-- m --><br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan2/</a><!-- m --><br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan3/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan3/</a><!-- m --><br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan4/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan4/</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  Thank you.<br />  Vairam</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Hi,<br />Very true - The knowledge we get imparted by ur curiosity, books,<br />learning is what Lord Muruga gives. My interest is Tamil Literature<br />itself was gift of Lord Muruga. The first book I read about Tamil<br />Literature is Smile of Murugan by Kamil V Zvelebil.<br /><br />It again true that a ocean cannot be measured in 10 pages of my<br />article. <br />Characteristics of a society is reflected in the god they<br />worship.My basic motif in writing this article is to analyse how the<br />changes in society in pre historic times have possibly changed the<br />characteristics of the god we know.<br />Even if some of these hypotheses are true , Lord Murugan might<br />turn out to be the Oldest surviving god in India pre dating the Vedic<br />religion by many thousand years.<br />There are clear literature evidence that Murugan known in early<br />Sangam literature like Purananuru Kurunthokai etc has evolved and<br />attained various characteristics which was not know before in the late<br />sangam literature like Paripatal, Thirumurugatrupadai.<br /><br />The reasons for this change is attributed to Aryanisation or<br />Sanskiritisation of the south. Similarly this God Murugan must have<br />attained various characteristics with time in pre history, my article<br />is very outline of possible changes in society which has caused this<br />change in characteristics of the god.<br /><br />My article is more in the sense to analyse when and why possibly<br />Murugan could have been associated with cock rather than analysing<br />various philosophies behind the cocks association with Murugan. There<br />are various reasons including knowledge and fertility for Murugan's<br />association with cock.But there is no proof that cock was domesticted<br />before 800-700 BC. My intention at that point is more towards the<br />domestication of Cocks would have been the probable time when Murugan<br />got associated with cock.The reason he might be attributed cock is<br />unkown since there is no written or archaeological evidence.But the<br />most possible reason is either fertility or knowledge.<br /><br />The nature of murugan as 'Hunters ,spirit of forest and God of Love<br />- fertility whatever' can be traced to sangam literature. I can quote<br />many sangam poems in case if you would like to review them.<br /><br /><br />And regarding etymology of Murugan(intitally know as Murukan) I am<br />quoting I.Mahadevan below<br />"<br />Much of the later Tamil literature, and virtually all the Tamil<br />inscriptions and iconographic motifs have been heavily influenced by<br />the Sanskritic traditions of Skanda-Karttikeya-Kumara and have very<br />little in common with the primitive muruku except the name Murukan.39<br />Even the meaning of his name has undergone a radical transformation<br />from muruku `the demon or destroyer' to Murukan `the beautiful one',<br />consistent with the later notion that gods must be `beautiful' and<br />demons `ugly'. As P.L. Samy points out in his incisive study of<br />Murukan in the Cankam works, there is no support for the later meaning<br />in the earliest poems. He derives muruku (Murukan) and murukku `to<br />destroy' from Dr. muru-, and endorses the identification of Murukan<br />with muradeva (a class of demons) mentioned in the Rgveda, as proposed<br />by Karmarkar.40<br /><br />39. The earliest epigraphic reference to Murukan in Tamilnadu is found<br />in the Tiruttani (Velancheri) Plates of Pallava Aparajitavarman (ca.<br />900AD); R. Nagaswamy. Sculptures of Murukan begin to appear only from<br />the Pallava-Early Pandya Period (from ca. 7-8 cent. AD). For a<br />comprehensive treatment of the iconography of Murukan in Tamilnadu,<br />see L'Hernault.<br /><br />40. P.L. Samy, pp. 9-16, 96. A.P. Karmarkar, p.128. it is significant<br />that the name mura in the RV is derived by Sayana from the root with<br />the meaning marana `killing'."<br /><br />I do understand and appreciate the philosophy of Murgan in Sangam<br />literature where he dosen't kill Curan instead transforms him into<br />Cock and a peacock. <br />   <br />I surely have not tried to question any philosophy of Murugan and<br />rather I have tried to say Origins of Murugan is way far beyond the<br />time limit we usually think .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And to end I would always like to say ' History of south India is<br />History of Murugan'. My whole essay is in a Historical point of view<br />rather than Philosophical point of view. <br /><br />Thank you,<br />Vairam    <br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The work with archeology is commendable and the article is <br />  impressive. <br />  <br />  To start, there is a quote in Kandar Anubuthi<br />  "Yaam odhiya kalviyum, yem arivum, thaame pera velavar thandathanaal,<br />  Poo mel mayal poi, arra mei punarvir namir nadaveer nadaver iniye<br />  In short &#40;It would take atleas 2 pages to explain these two lines in <br />  detail&#41;: <br />  The knowledge we get imparted by ur curiosity, books, learning is <br />  what Lord Muruga gives.

			<div class="content">Hi,<br />Thank you for your valuable comments. I will edit my article soon<br />and give more references and footnotes with more quotes from Sangam<br />Literature(Murugan as hill deity and various rituals performed to him).<br />I had lot of data and reference but I am very very new to writing<br />hence i could not decide how much to write and where I should stop or<br />go further.<br />Though I had finished reading some literature before hand, it still<br />took me 3 days continuously to read about Indus valley script and<br />various critics about it and pre history of South India. <br />Hindu article also gave me a clue that Sri Lankan pre history<br />connected with Tamil Nadu pre history.<br />So I had lot of things to write , I seriously didnt know what to<br />delete and what to add.<br /><br />I would surely go through the articles you have suggested me to read.<br />There is an extensive literature about Kamakshi Meenakshi and Neli<br />getting integrated into the Brahminic relegion , the book is ' Tamil<br />Temple myths' By David Shulman. This book is considered to be very<br />important literature since it throws light into early Tamil religious<br />beliefs and rituals.I have this book right now with me and I have<br />finished around 40 pages out of 400 Pages. I have long way to go.<br /><br />Adichinallur excavation has also had possiblity of one more male<br />deity with a trident. He might be a Proto form of Shiva(mere<br />speculation as of now).<br /><br />I once again thank you for reading my essay and giving me valuable<br />comments.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Vairam<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br />   <br />    I have written an essay detailing the history of Murugan form Pre<br />    historic times to Sangam era.<br />    Please read it and comment about the work.<br />    <br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a><!-- m --><br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan2/</a><!-- m --><br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan3/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan3/</a><!-- m --><br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan4/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan4/</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    Thank you.<br />    Vairam<br />   ================<br />  <br />  The links deal extensively on several aspects :: <br />  <br />  Request : <br />  <br />  1.

			<div class="content">Hello Vairam<br /><br />We can take this discussion offline and communicate via email if you <br />would be interested in a longer discussion. Your research and article <br />is very valid as it is He who prompts your work. Who knows what He <br />has in store <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />But to read him based out of physical evidence only in a specific <br />context will not be sufficient. my first intutive question would be - <br />where was the first sangam formed ? Ceylon or Andaman or southern TN <br />or .... as in some theories...Lemuria?<br />Nakeerar - was he from the 1st sangam or any subsequent sangam? I am <br />yet to find any convincing evidences to this.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Characteristics of a society is reflected in the god they<br />  worship.<br />I would contest this, I believe God has no charecterstics, it is we</div></blockquote>with our infinite karma and grossly msconstrued know it all knowledge <br />create charecterstics. He is Formless as in Kadirgama, but He (God in <br />General) is the very form of all of us. Prahalathan and Hiryanya <br />created Narasimha, Suran created Skanda, Mahisasuran created Durga so <br />on and so forth.<br /><br />Your research points to the charecterstics of the Lord as humans <br />evolved, my point is humans became what He wanted us to become.<br />Murugan associated with cock as we begun domesticating the fowl is <br />not very convincing to me, I do value every scientific thought, I am <br />fascinated by the Lord's way to keep us intrigued. This statement <br />however cannot be justified. We do not have enough evidence that the <br />seval was NOT associated with the Lord prior to 800 BC. <br /><br />Now going back to the statement of Kannadasan, "Kodi asainthathum <br />katru vanthatha - katru vandathum - kodi asainthatha". That is <br />something to be considered as a stream while researching.<br /><br />God of love & war, fertility etc being associated with Murgan is like <br />a daily routine, He who is also the creator of the world, the <br />protector and the destroyer, as a creator, fertility is vital for <br />sristi to happen. <br />Thirupugazh song on Parankundram - 'Karuvadainthu pathu': last lines <br />say " Ayanayum pudaithu sinanthu - ulagamum padaithu parinthu".<br /><br />Moods and swings of the author must be taken into count. Nakkerar, <br />thought process when he wrote the murugatru padai must be taken into <br />count, his mind frame should be given enough credit too.<br /><br />By your intensive study, I will be curious to know the dates of <br />Palani or Thiruchendur or the syambu murthy of thiruporur or the <br />swyambu vel at Solai malai. I believe the time of Bogar was prior to <br />Nakeerar. I agree that pallava and chola kings did help with the <br />temples and architecture. I will be interested in knowing more on <br />specific temples (cave and shore) such as Thiruporur, Chendur and <br />Valli malai. Please do post them if you can.<br /><br />Again, I apprecite and applaud your work as it really is of great <br />interest in my line. Research history of how we are connected to him <br />is fine but the other way around is not something that can be <br />implored without creating controversy.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi,<br />  Very true - The knowledge we get imparted by ur curiosity, <br />books,<br />  learning is what Lord Muruga gives. My interest is Tamil Literature<br />  itself was gift of Lord Muruga. The first book I read about Tamil<br />  Literature is Smile of Murugan by Kamil V Zvelebil.<br />  <br />  It again true that a ocean cannot be measured in 10 pages of my<br />  article. <br />  Characteristics of a society is reflected in the god they<br />  worship.My basic motif in writing this article is to analyse how the<br />  changes in society in pre historic times have possibly changed the<br />  characteristics of the god we know.<br />  Even if some of these hypotheses are true , Lord Murugan might<br />  turn out to be the Oldest surviving god in India pre dating the <br />Vedic<br />  religion by many thousand years.<br />  There are clear literature evidence that Murugan known in early<br />  Sangam literature like Purananuru Kurunthokai etc has evolved and<br />  attained various characteristics which was not know before in the <br />late<br />  sangam literature like Paripatal, Thirumurugatrupadai.<br />  <br />  The reasons for this change is attributed to Aryanisation or<br />  Sanskiritisation of the south. Similarly this God Murugan must have<br />  attained various characteristics with time in pre history, my <br />article<br />  is very outline of possible changes in society which has caused this<br />  change in characteristics of the god.<br />  <br />  My article is more in the sense to analyse when and why possibly<br />  Murugan could have been associated with cock rather than analysing<br />  various philosophies behind the cocks association with Murugan. <br />There<br />  are various reasons including knowledge and fertility for Murugan&#39;s<br />  association with cock.But there is no proof that cock was  <br />domesticted<br />  before 800-700 BC. My intention at that point is more towards the<br />  domestication of Cocks would have been the probable time when <br />Murugan<br />  got associated with cock.The reason he might be attributed cock is<br />  unkown since there is no written or archaeological evidence.But the<br />  most possible reason is either fertility or knowledge.<br />  <br />  The nature of murugan as &#39;Hunters ,spirit of forest and God of <br />Love<br />  - fertility whatever&#39; can be traced to sangam literature. I can <br />quote<br />  many sangam poems in case if you would like to review them.<br />  <br />  <br />  And regarding etymology of Murugan&#40;intitally know as Murukan&#41; I am<br />  quoting I.Mahadevan below<br />  "<br />  Much of the later Tamil literature, and virtually all the Tamil<br />  inscriptions and iconographic motifs have been heavily influenced by<br />  the Sanskritic traditions of Skanda-Karttikeya-Kumara and have very<br />  little in common with the primitive muruku except the name <br />Murukan.39<br />  Even the meaning of his name has undergone a radical transformation<br />  from muruku `the demon or destroyer&#39; to Murukan `the beautiful one&#39;,<br />  consistent with the later notion that gods must be `beautiful&#39; and<br />  demons `ugly&#39;. As P.L. Samy points out in his incisive study of<br />  Murukan in the Cankam works, there is no support for the later <br />meaning<br />  in the earliest poems. He derives muruku &#40;Murukan&#41; and murukku `to<br />  destroy&#39; from Dr. muru-, and endorses the identification of Murukan<br />  with muradeva &#40;a class of demons&#41; mentioned in the Rgveda, as <br />proposed<br />  by Karmarkar.40<br />  <br />  39. The earliest epigraphic reference to Murukan in Tamilnadu is <br />found<br />  in the Tiruttani &#40;Velancheri&#41; Plates of Pallava Aparajitavarman &#40;ca.<br />  900AD&#41;; R. Nagaswamy. Sculptures of Murukan begin to appear only <br />from<br />  the Pallava-Early Pandya Period &#40;from ca. 7-8 cent. AD&#41;. For a<br />  comprehensive treatment of the iconography of Murukan in Tamilnadu,<br />  see L&#39;Hernault.<br />  <br />  40. P.L. Samy, pp. 9-16, 96. A.P. Karmarkar, p.128. it is <br />significant<br />  that the name mura in the RV is derived by Sayana from the root with<br />  the meaning marana `killing&#39;."<br />  <br />  I do understand and appreciate the philosophy of Murgan in Sangam<br />  literature where he dosen&#39;t kill Curan instead transforms him into<br />  Cock and a peacock. <br />     <br />  I surely have not tried to question any philosophy of Murugan <br />and<br />  rather I have tried to say Origins of Murugan is way far beyond the<br />  time limit we usually think .<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  And to end I would always like to say &#39; History of south India <br />is<br />  History of Murugan&#39;. My whole essay is in a Historical point of view<br />  rather than Philosophical point of view. <br />  <br />  Thank you,<br />  Vairam    <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br />   <br />    The work with archeology is commendable and the article is <br />    impressive. <br />    <br />    To start, there is a quote in Kandar Anubuthi<br />    "Yaam odhiya kalviyum, yem arivum, thaame pera velavar <br />thandathanaal,<br />    Poo mel mayal poi, arra mei punarvir namir nadaveer nadaver iniye<br />    In short &#40;It would take atleas 2 pages to explain these two lines <br />in <br />    detail&#41;: <br />    The knowledge we get imparted by ur curiosity, books, learning is <br />    what Lord Muruga gives. True knowledge is what we get on uttering <br />the <br />    Name of the Lord. That is obtained by breaking the shield of <br />worldly <br />    knowledge &#40;poo mel mayal poi - arra mei punarvir&#41;.<br />    <br />    The history of Lord muruga from sangam - as per the article is <br />like <br />    identifying the million piece puzzle game with two or three <br />units. <br />    <br />    Strictly going by the article, I would like to question the <br />basics of <br />    their thought process. Killing God ? Muruku means youthful <br />splendor. <br />    Before going further, I would tell one more information on the <br />    difference between Skanda and Palani andavar. Each are a version <br />of <br />    the Paramaatma at diffrent times and different planes and <br />different <br />    needs of Karma balances. He is stated as Velakkara kadavul as he <br />    vouches the protect the devotee at any cost. In fact, if you <br />observe <br />    well, he has not killed even Sooran. Murugan sooranai &#39;thaduthu <br />    aatkondan&#39;.<br />    <br />    We have learned to read and see things sequentially that we fail <br />to <br />    understand the parallel words or existances or the time <br />differences <br />    etc. <br />    <br />    Skanda as Devasenapathi was one such form of the Lord Almighty, <br />that <br />    form he took to equate Suran. It has no relation to the Palani <br />    andavar or Vayalur murugan or so on so forth. Each one is an <br />avatar <br />    and each one has a different purpose, they all are the base <br />    paramatma. Muruganai pol santha swaroopiyum illai, skandanai pol <br />    akrosham kondvarum illai. No wonder, many people in north who <br />pray <br />    Karthikeya do not know the existance of Valli amma, this avatar <br />is <br />    only here in our backyard.<br />    <br />    The article however brings to light some interesting aspects on <br />the <br />    sangam and other parts that point me to lean that the base for <br />the <br />    writing comes from Ceylon. Kathirgamam is the place where Aruva <br />    vazhibadu happens today, according to legend, Brahma took the <br />form of <br />    a hunter and prayed to the Lord. <br />    Quote here: Thirupugazh Song &#39;Aharamum aagi Athibanum <br />aagi&#39;,Location: <br />    Palamuthir solai: <br />    "Vana murai vedan aruliya poosai , magizh kathir kaamam udayone"<br />     <br />    &#40;Kamam&#41;, these are purely related to Kathir Kamam.<br />    <br />    Also, I would be curious to know the mood of the person <br />researching <br />    the colors of Mayon and Murugavel. Black and Red with anger ? How <br />    about this line of thought, the early morning dawn afer a dark <br />night? <br />    The dawn is symbolized by the sounding of a Cock and the Darkness <br />is <br />    needed to see the dawn, they do not exist without each other. <br />Irul <br />    illamal oli illai, Maal illamal Mal marukan illai, both darkness <br />and <br />    light are the forms of the same entity. Irulai irul aaki oliyai <br />    tharuvaan. <br />    <br />    I personally think it is ignorance to classify the Lord of <br />Knowledge <br />    to domestication of cock and primitive thoughts on peacock or <br />    elephant. Going by this scale, how would we explain a hayagreeva <br />or <br />    moshika vaahanan? <br />    <br />    The history of the Lord&#39;s worship &#40;relationship&#41; with mankind <br />cannot <br />    be traced thus, it would be like measuring the ocean with a foot <br />    scale. We are not even in a stage to figure out where is the <br />resting <br />    place of the great king who walked our country, we definitely do <br />not <br />    have the capacity to speculate on the ever living beyond the <br />concept <br />    of &#39;time&#39;.<br />    <br />    Long story short - Rishi moolam - nadhi moolam ....<br />    <br />    -- Murugan adimai<br />    -- Ravi <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br />     <br />      I have written an essay detailing the history of Murugan form <br />Pre<br />      historic times to Sangam era.<br />      Please read it and comment about the work.<br />      <br />      <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a><!-- m --><br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan2/</a><!-- m --><br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan3/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan3/</a><!-- m --><br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan4/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan4/</a><!-- m --><br />      <br />      Thank you.<br />      Vairam</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I second that. Nijamana vairam. Historians don't have<br />to be believers by the way and it is possible to write<br />about origins of religious deities without offending<br />religious sentiments. Thiru Vairam has done that<br />remarkably well.<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- Sivapathasekaran  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thank you Vairam.<br /> <br />  So you are.<br /> <br />  sps<br /> <br /> <br />  -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Hi,<br />    Thank you for your valuable comments. I will<br />  edit my article<br />  soon<br />    and give more references and footnotes with more<br />  quotes from Sangam<br />    Literature&#40;Murugan as hill deity and various<br />  rituals performed to<br />  him&#41;.<br />    I had lot of data and reference but I am very<br />  very new to<br />  writing<br />    hence i could not decide how much to write and<br />  where I should stop<br />  or<br />    go further.<br />    Though I had finished reading some literature<br />  before hand, it<br />  still<br />    took me 3 days continuously to read about Indus<br />  valley script and<br />    various critics about it and pre history of South<br />  India.<br />    Hindu article also gave me a clue that Sri<br />  Lankan pre history<br />    connected with Tamil Nadu pre history.<br />    So I had lot of things to write , I seriously<br />  didnt know what to<br />    delete and what to add.<br />   <br />    I would surely go through the articles you have<br />  suggested me to<br />  read.<br />    There is an extensive literature about Kamakshi<br />  Meenakshi and<br />  Neli<br />    getting integrated into the Brahminic relegion ,<br />  the book is &#39;<br />  Tamil<br />    Temple myths&#39; By David Shulman. This book is<br />  considered to be very<br />    important literature since it throws light into<br />  early Tamil<br />  religious<br />    beliefs and rituals.I have this book right now<br />  with me and I have<br />    finished around 40 pages out of 400 Pages. I have<br />  long way to go.<br />   <br />    Adichinallur excavation has also had possiblity<br />  of one more male<br />    deity with a trident. He might be a Proto form of<br />  Shiva&#40;mere<br />    speculation as of now&#41;.<br />   <br />    I once again thank you for reading my essay and<br />  giving me<br />  valuable<br />    comments.<br />   <br />    Thank you<br />    Vairam<br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Sivapathasekaran"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"<br />   wrote:</div></blockquote><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!
