			<div class="content">The following is an article on Cholas and their relationship with <br />Myanmar. The article was written by Virarajendhra in Formhub.<br /><br /><br />Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} <br /><br />With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful ruling <br />dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the political <br />scene of South India. <br /><br />In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the throne as <br />the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He gradually <br />conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within the <br />Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. <br /><br />He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to grow <br />steadily into an overseas empire. <br />During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there existed two <br />main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the region <br />called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the capital <br />at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) kingdom <br />of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern Miyanmar also <br />known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at Sudhammavati (the <br />present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the medieval <br />period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan.<br /><br />While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king Kyizo <br />{A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who was <br />ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period of <br />Rajaraja - 1. <br /><br />During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded with <br />Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from Rammanadesa <br />being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" in the <br />Tamil Nadu. <br /><br />Period of Rajendra Chola ÃƒÂ± 1 {A.D.1012-1044} <br />With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola throne <br />after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) started rule <br />in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king Kyizo, <br />and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha (A.D.?? ÃƒÂ± <br />1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. <br /><br />During this time there had been much sea traffic between these two <br />countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in trade <br />with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as Arumanam) <br />and the Mirammadesa. <br /><br />In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was spreading it's <br />authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present Indonesia <br />and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at one time <br />a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in South-<br />East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer hinderences to <br />the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present Miyanmar. <br /><br />Rajendra Chola ÃƒÂ± 1 sent one of his grandson with great force in <br />A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore the title <br />as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East Asia <br />after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), reached the <br />country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar.<br /><br />They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly the <br />present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of the <br />Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated it's <br />ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the Rajendra <br />Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. <br /><br />At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-1079) on <br />the throne. <br /><br />Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ÃƒÂ± 1 {A.D.1018-1054}<br /><br />In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by his <br />eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ÃƒÂ± 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on Chola <br />throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes to the <br />Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. <br /><br />Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} <br /><br />Rajadhiraja Chola ÃƒÂ± 1 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />Rajendra Chola ÃƒÂ± 2 on Chola throne. <br /><br />Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who came to <br />the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south Miyanmar <br />and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan also <br />informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the Talaing <br />kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and also <br />many sacred relics. <br /><br />King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent his wise <br />minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha requesting some <br />copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with much ill <br />reply. <br /><br />This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with king <br />Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which king <br />Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family to <br />Arimaddanapura. <br /><br />From: this year onwards the Rammanadesa became part of the Arimaddana <br />empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was appointed <br />to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new capital <br />of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the capture <br />of it's king Manuha. <br /><br />It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, and it <br />coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own viceroy to <br />rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the Cholas. <br /><br />There seems to have been no immediate response and retaliation from <br />the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, and <br />which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. <br /><br />Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} <br /><br />Rajendra Chola ÃƒÂ± 2 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this time the <br />viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed by the <br />Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa.<br /><br />In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region of <br />Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling king of <br />Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of Virarajendra <br />Chola in regaining his kingdom. <br />The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help the king <br />of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead his <br />great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa (Arumanam). <br /><br />However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha at <br />Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to Cholas and <br />allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of Chola <br />forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests of the <br />Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his victory <br />over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />victory "jayastamba" at Prome. <br /><br />Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073}<br /><br />In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his son <br />Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola throne. <br />During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of Sri <br />Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his country <br />from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, few <br />years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />requesting for military assistance against Cholas.<br /><br />But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his growing <br />empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by providing <br />forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents to him <br />including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. <br /><br />Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123}<br /><br />Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, which <br />resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} ascending <br />the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. <br /><br />In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and successfully <br />expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a period of <br />nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half of Sri <br />Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor the <br />Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />northern half of Sri Lanka. <br /><br />King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in the <br />control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious elderly <br />Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious books, <br />and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this request and <br />sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who instituted a <br />Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism in Sri <br />Lanka. <br /><br />Emperor Anawratha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his rule <br />the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. However <br />immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and Kyanzittha <br />also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a son of <br />Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from Bengal - <br />took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. <br /><br />At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces returned back <br />saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung and Nga <br />Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - Traders <br />and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the Tamil <br />Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who were now <br />settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur possibly <br />under captivity. <br /><br />Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an army <br />under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to avenge <br />the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely welcomed <br />him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, and took <br />time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. <br /><br />The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with the <br />Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola prince and <br />his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. <br /><br />It appears during this period with the newly builtup relations the <br />traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the Chola <br />empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and they were <br />also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without any <br />hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". <br /><br />Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana Kulasekara <br />Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the former <br />capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time under the <br />rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), gave a <br />sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly in the <br />mandapa of this temple. <br /><br />In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay tributes to <br />the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung Empire. <br />The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank and <br />ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the grand <br />council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri Vijaya. <br /><br />During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees were <br />addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot look <br />down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire to <br />adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih (Arabs), Chiao-<br />chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees were all <br />written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and stored in <br />a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade silk <br />double wrapper as sealing envelope ÃƒÂ± The emperor approved....." <br />Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />(A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. <br /><br />Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} & Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />{A.D.1133-1150} <br /><br />It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had with <br />Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ÃƒÂ± 1, <br />during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga Chola ÃƒÂ± <br />2. <br /><br />Period of Rajaraja Chola ÃƒÂ± 2 {A.D.1146-1163}<br /><br />However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the distant <br />lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the Pappalam the <br />seaport city of Rammanadesa. <br />However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea traffic <br />on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar kingdoms even <br />thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders being <br />aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from China, has <br />to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the Pukan <br />(Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of trade <br />activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. <br /><br />Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas <br />Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of the <br />Pandiyan empire we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. <br /><br />Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ÃƒÂ± 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be the <br />overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and Sadaiyavarman <br />Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received tributes from <br />Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country is <br />left out for further research study as it does not fall within the <br />scope of the title of this essay. <br /><br /><br />source edited from<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.siddha.com.my/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000039.html">http://www.siddha.com.my/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000039.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />may be useful<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.worldisround.com/articles/14161/text.html">http://www.worldisround.com/articles/14161/text.html</a><!-- m --></div>
