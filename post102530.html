In that town came the man of unimaginable <br />great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam and <br />the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge he <br />came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling snake <br />ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for that <br />comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he undertook <br />the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle of <br />vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and knowledge. <br />When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance the <br />ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the Three-<br />eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was a <br />devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a devotee to <br />the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and properties <br />and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for that. <br />paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the town. <br />He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />principles of the devotee. <br /><br /><br /><br />For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and flowing <br />river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to host <br />feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. He <br />being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed devotees he <br />was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his service was <br />continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the Lord the <br />couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To celebrate the <br />birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the austerities the <br />devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He donated <br />liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the sound of <br />vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with utmost care <br />of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to the <br />school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun that rose <br />to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in shaivam - the <br />prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his soft feet <br />on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint stayed in <br />his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-hearted <br />service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. <br /><br />The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which are <br />terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning like <br />matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of the <br />young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy ash, in <br />place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the ornament of <br />skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the fierce <br />elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the black <br />throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, beauty <br />throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in the <br />legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the Supreme <br />came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire world, <br />acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. The <br />Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of Lord in <br />the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing a sage <br />had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to come <br />inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come inside the <br />house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went to <br />the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her husband did <br />not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching for one <br />and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come on his <br />own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord appreciated her <br />that they followed in the right way the discipline of family life, <br />but still He would not enter the house without the devotee present <br />and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. <br /><br />To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any devotee, <br />his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the form of <br />bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for him. <br />With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to be <br />asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great even <br />though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as great <br />only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the devotees <br />call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds he <br />would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who claimed <br />to come from the north said the food He wanted was very difficult to <br />prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the age <br />not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be the <br />only child for the family and the child s parents should cook it <br />happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there is <br />nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the devotees. <br />Saluting Him he came back home. <br /><br />The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. They <br />decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have food. <br />Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed him, <br />cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child s <br />hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father cut his <br />head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the devotee. <br />Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast the <br />loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then the <br />superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the feast. <br />Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they sprinkled that <br />holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His principled <br />wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a plate <br />over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked all the <br />parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that as the <br />head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that wonderable <br />couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward and said <br />that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful when <br />the devotee eats, and gave that part too. <br /><br />Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. chiRuth <br />thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To the <br />worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and asked him <br />to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food that his <br />wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept the <br />feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry while He <br />Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked him to <br />call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son being <br />present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and called <br />out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the child s <br />name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the devotee <br />have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son came <br />running as if he was returning from the school. The couple embraced <br />him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the devotee <br />accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they were <br />shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat that was <br />cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, removing <br />their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who disappeared <br />appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas and the <br />young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the devotee, <br />his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable shakti and <br />the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their feet <br />that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. <br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Ennapaa madan<br />  <br />  eesanukku "pillai kari" samaithu pottaval thiruvengaattu nangai.<br />  &#40;periya puranam&#41;<br />  <br />  districtayE change pannukirai.<br />  <br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Madan U <br />  Sreenivasan"  wrote:<br />   <br />    Kalki mentions in Parthiban kanavu that siruthondar&#39;s wife was <br />from<br />    thiruvenkadu... is it the same? any idea?
