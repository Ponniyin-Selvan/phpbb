			<div class="content">Mr Rahul,<br /><br />This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha Ha Ha.... The <br />Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! Hey, definitely it is not. All along <br />I have observed the valuable contribution of others on History of TN <br />here. I would contribute only on the subject that I know. Since I <br />knew very less or nothing about the history (Honestly, only <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />created the interest in History on me) I was a silent observer. As <br />you observed correctly, since the topic was about something the I <br />knew I contributed. So please do not conclude that I know much. And <br />no sorries please. I understand your intention and no ill feelings.<br /><br />In fact I know that there is a widespread belief about the Iyengars <br />being Fanatic in that they wont go to Siva Temple. This is just <br />misrepresented and that is why I tried to clarify the reason why the <br />Iyengars do not go to Siva Temples. Honestly, I have been to Siva <br />temples, but let me admit that I dont pray there. Another refuge <br />under Nammazhwar. He says in his Thiruvaimozhi <br /><br />....koLLak kuRaivilan, vEndiRRu ellAm tharum kOdhil en maNivaNNan....<br /><br />He says that Vishnu is capable of giving all that one wants, in the <br />spirit of the same philosophy (husband-wife bhAvam) that I wrote <br />before. <br /><br />This is what is called harmony. I may believe in a God and stick to <br />Him. But I will never defame another God. I may not pray to Him. That <br />doesn't mean I disrespect Him. Exactly like a wife being loyal only <br />to her Husband. Thirumazhisai Azhwar's life history signifies tis. He <br />was a staunch Vaishnavite everyone knows. One when he was stiching <br />his clothes, Siva and Parvathi were coming rounds around the earth <br />and Parvathi was attracted by the "tEjas" of this Azhwar and told <br />Siva that we should give him some boon. Siva, knowing about this <br />Azhwar, was hesitant but gave in to the pressure of Parvathi <br />(mmmmm.... anga kooda appidithAn pola) and both came down and asked <br />the Azhwar to ask for a boon. The Azhwar said with complete respect <br />that he does not want anything from them. But when insisted, he being <br />a truly surrendered soul awaiting only mOksha, asked for it. Siva <br />says that only Vishnu can give that. Azhwar says then he does not <br />want anything. But again on insisting, he asked a very trivial boon <br />that the thread should enter the needle at the back. Though at the <br />outset it will look like a dry sarcasm without any respect, it is <br />just reflective of the position that he does not want anything. The <br />Azhwar never disrespected Siva. This is the same bhAvam that all <br />Iyengars follow. <br /><br />However, if any Iyengar, talks ill of any other God, not only Siva, <br />he ceases to be a true Vaishnavite as again Nammazhwar glorifies in <br />his Thiruviruttham this time as....<br /><br />vaNangum thuRaigaL pala pala Aakki, madhi vigaRppAl<br />piNangum samayam pala pala Aakki, avai avaidhOru<br />aNangum pala pala Aakki, nin moorthi parappi vaithAi<br />iNangu ninnOrai illAi, nin <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> vEtkai ezhuvippaNE<br /><br />Wonderful words. For Nammazhwar everything is Vishnu or Kannan as he <br />says "....uNNum sOru, thinnum vetRilai, parugum nIr, ellAm kaNNan..." <br />He say in the above pAsuram that Vishnu created so many religions <br />and so many forms of worship so that all the jeevAthmAs can attain <br />salvation by one means or other and He is present in all those <br />religions and forms. So where is the question of disrespecting Siva <br />or for that sake any god. I would consider that every God of every <br />religion is Vishnu as per the above words of the Kulapathi Nammazhwar.<br /><br />And lastly I dont want to start a debate on Vaishnavism Vs Saivism <br />and spoil the wonderful ambience of this group, which respects all.<br /><br />Sorry for the digression and thank you for the opportunity to present <br />a more clear picture about the Vaishnavites sticking only to Vishnu, <br />which is definitely not fanaticism, but a bhAvam as per their <br />philosophy.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Mr.Venketesh &#40;vinjamoor_venketesh, this is getting crazy <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> &#41;<br />  You writings are very informative.

Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters <br />into a<br />    philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup<br />    regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on <br />that<br />    debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it <br />is<br />    subject to a debate.<br />   <br />    Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. <br />He<br />    attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines<br />    which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />   <br />    Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the<br />    Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though<br />    within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that<br />    Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and <br />got<br />    it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was<br />    reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere &#40;may be in<br />    this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated during the times of <br />Nayak<br />    kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.<br />   <br />    Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as<br />    Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of<br />    Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the<br />    history.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "R.venketesh" <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      Hi<br />      so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />     <br />      i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41; instruments used on <br />ramanuja<br />      himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were discovered in a<br />      secret chamber in the last decade<br />     <br />      .

Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri<br />    for<br />      his<br />            bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and<br />        informed that<br />            the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well <br />about<br />    the<br />            Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, <br />the<br />        foremost<br />            disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome <br />of<br />    the<br />            meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya<br />    and<br />        hence he<br />            silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along <br />with<br />        Periya<br />            Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the<br />    Chola<br />        King in<br />            the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other <br />disciples<br />    of<br />            Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and <br />asked<br />      them<br />        to<br />            prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though<br />      Ramanuja<br />        did<br />            not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that<br />      Koorathazhwan<br />        has<br />            already left in disguise, and also giving in to the <br />pressure<br />    by<br />        his<br />            other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of<br />    his<br />        Acharya<br />            &#40;Periya Nambi&#41; and his Sishya &#40;Koorathazhwan&#41;, left for<br />    Melkote<br />      in<br />            present day Karnataka.<br />           <br />            Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However,<br />    there<br />        was a<br />            minister by name "Naalooran" in King&#39;s court, who was once<br />        supposed to<br />            have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately <br />identified<br />      him<br />            &#40;traditional accounts vary from calling this act as <br />treachery<br />      to<br />        utmost<br />            concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth <br />yet to<br />    be<br />            deciphered&#41; as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained<br />        Koorathazhwan to<br />            write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The<br />        wording that<br />            Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam<br />      nAsthi".<br />            Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course<br />      Koorathazhwan<br />        did<br />            write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi <br />thatha<br />        param".<br />            Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than &#39;sivam". In older<br />    days<br />        the<br />            words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. <br />drONam<br />      was<br />        larger<br />            in measurement than sivam.<br />           <br />            On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and <br />asked<br />      the<br />        eyes<br />            of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya <br />Nambi.<br />        However<br />            Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my<br />    eyes.<br />      I<br />        will<br />            do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" <br />and<br />        plucks it<br />            himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the <br />pain.<br />           <br />            This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete <br />screw-<br />    up<br />      in<br />        the<br />            screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true.<br />      However<br />        we<br />            cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for<br />        ourselves.<br />           <br />            Regards,<br />            Venkatesh<br />           <br />            --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->       40yahoogroups.com ,<br />            "Humble Groups"<br />             wrote: <br />             <br />              I just saw Kalaignar&#39;s note about the first scene.

			<div class="content">Smt Malathi,<br /><br />Very good words.

Yes, you <br />look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show himself as Siva, if <br />you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as Vishnu. <br /><br />This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he was walking <br />through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of Srirangam were <br />playing with the sand, building a temple and on seeing Ramanuja <br />called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this prasAdham of your <br />beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed the kids and <br />took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with utmost respect in <br />the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the spot. He accepted <br />the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This is what is <br />glorified as bhAva suddhi. <br /><br />This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true Srivaishnavite <br />will disrespect another God.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I remember reading a story on this, don&#39;t know where,<br />  possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.<br />  <br />  A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />  better, naamam or thiruneeru.

My father, being<br />    a Saivite &#40;not fanatic,<br />    we visit Srirangam too&#41;, starts the arguement and it<br />    keeps continuing.<br />    For an arguement and topic which has been going on<br />    for more than 10<br />    centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.<br />    <br />    I just wanted to convey this, this is also a pretty<br />    sensitive topic hence i<br />    request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />    refrain from hurting<br />    another&#39;s feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />    openess of society we seem<br />    to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />    hand is required so i<br />    request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />    threads and mercilessy<br />    delete any mails which might seem offensive.<br />    <br />    Regards<br />    Rahul<br />    <br />    On 5/3/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      Mr Venketesh<br />     <br />      The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial<br />    debate going on<br />      between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />    thenkalais claim that<br />      vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />    after Ramanuja, but<br />      only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />    the Guruparampara.<br />      The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />    from Pillai<br />      Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br />     <br />      This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />    to accept the<br />      other&#39;s views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />    if one enters into a<br />      philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />    small writeup<br />      regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />    personal mails on that<br />      debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />    here. Ofcourse, it is<br />      subject to a debate.<br />     <br />      Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />    for 120 years. He<br />      attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />    are the timelines<br />      which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />     <br />      Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />    link to the<br />      Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />    happened later, though<br />      within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />    saying that<br />      Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />    from the sea and got<br />      it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />    sure, how he was<br />      reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />    somewhere &#40;may be in<br />      this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated during<br />    the times of Nayak<br />      kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />    Chitrakoodam.<br />     <br />      Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />    neither acting as<br />      Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />    of the Temple of<br />      Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />    mention in the<br />      history.<br />     <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    ,<br />      "R.venketesh" <br />      wrote: <br />       <br />        Hi<br />        so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />       <br />        i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41;<br />    instruments used on ramanuja<br />        himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />    discovered in a<br />        secret chamber in the last decade<br />       <br />        .

			<div class="content">Respected SPS sir,<br /><br />The Guruparampara Prabhavam is said to have been compiled sometime <br />after the demise of Ramanuja. I vaguely remember it was Pinbazhagiya <br />Perumal Jeeyar, a third generation disciple of Ramanuja.<br /><br />Ramanuja<br />l<br />l<br />Parasara Bhattar<br />l<br />l<br />Nanjeeyar<br />l<br />l<br />Nampillai<br />l<br />l<br />Pinbazhagiya Perumal Jeeyar.<br /><br />The tree will clarify this. But remember all the above AchAryAs upto <br />Nanjeeyar lived along with Ramanuja. Nampillai and Pinbazhagiya <br />Perumal Jeeyar were contemporaries though the latter was a disciple <br />of the former. I will throw more light on this, regarding the <br />timelines shortly. Kindly bear with me.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Right u r Malathi.<br />  " Entha maatramuna<br />  evvaaru thalachina antha <br />  mathrame neevu "<br />  <br />  This is the base line of our Esdteemed member writer <br />  Dhivakar&#39;s &#39;Thirumalai Thirudan&#39;<br />  <br />  Shobha<br />  <br />   <br />  ------------<br />  Recalling: ALL THE ROADS ARE LEADING TO ROME.

			<div class="content">Mr Sathish,<br /><br />I am giving my two cents worth below.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Very informative discussions and quite interesting.<br />  <br />  The marking of sanku and chakkaram...I think they call it also <br />as &#39;deekshai&#39;.. am i right?<br />  <br />  Its good to know that reason for people not going to Siva temple <br />just because of the <br />  loyalty and nothing else. Is this applicable to people only who <br />take deeksha or all the <br />  vaishnavites?</div></blockquote>The bonding takes places, literally after the dheekshai or <br />samAshrayaNam. However as a practice since the elders do not go, the <br />young ones too follow. It is but natural for the kids to emulate <br />their elders, isn't it.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>why I am asking this is,people who dont take deekshai also dont go <br />to siva <br />  temple. This is not generalized as I know iyengars generously <br />participating in siva <br />  worship. But there are other kind of people too.... recently a <br />group of iyengars went on a <br />  trip to Badri but they didnt go to Kedar. I really appreciated <br />their devotion but at the same <br />  time wondering how can they do it? As discussed, its upto the <br />individual preference and <br />  should not be questions.So lets leave it there.</div></blockquote>The only reason, definitely is as I said earlier. The loyalty in <br />relationship.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Kalki says that saivam and vaishnavam was not like the <br />current day practice, where a <br />  family will be totally saivam or vaishnavam..A person can be a <br />strong saivite, and his <br />  brother can be a staunch viashnavite.. But later days it changed. I <br />think its true.</div></blockquote><br />This observation of Kalki is very correct. I will reply on this more <br />with the smArtha episode below.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>We know a family where one is a saivite and his co-brother was a <br />vaishnavite. when we <br />  built a temple in our area in 1993, when the saivite donated the <br />whole shrine of Siva, just <br />  for competition his co-brother said he will build the entire vishnu <br />shrine. this competition <br />  helped the area vasis ultimately <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  <br />  Also, there is an understanding that in brahmins iyers are saivites <br />and iyengars are <br />  vaishnavites. Iyengars being vaishnavites is accepted. But iyers <br />being saivites is not.<br />  Kanchi maha periyava clarified that people who follow sanakara <br />bagavad padal &#40;those who <br />  are considered to be saivites&#41; are not saivites, but smarthas.</div></blockquote>Yes, the Kanchi periyavaa is right. The followers of Sankaracharya <br />are termed Smarthas, though by and large they adorn the Saivite <br />symbols. And as you said correctly, according to advaitham, there is <br />no supremity of one God over the other. That is why you see many <br />Iyers worshipping both Siva and Vishnu equally, though the emphasis <br />is more on Siva. This answers the question above too.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>smartha means those who accept advaitam and in advaitam there is no <br />supremacy of one <br />  god over other. so there is no question of following siva or vishnu <br />and consider all the <br />  gods are ONE.<br />  <br />  But the current day understanding is quite different.</div></blockquote>Yes, the times are changing and so are the understanding.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Coming back to Dasavatharam, given the hype I am very much eager to <br />watch this. It <br />  should not sothapify as any other kamal movie which comes with a <br />hype.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote></div>

Yes, <br />you <br />  look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show himself as Siva, <br />if <br />  you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as Vishnu. <br />  <br />  This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he was walking <br />  through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of Srirangam were <br />  playing with the sand, building a temple and on seeing Ramanuja <br />  called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this prasAdham of <br />your <br />  beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed the kids and <br />  took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with utmost respect <br />in <br />  the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the spot. He accepted <br />  the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This is what is <br />  glorified as bhAva suddhi. <br />  <br />  This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true <br />Srivaishnavite <br />  will disrespect another God.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan  <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    I remember reading a story on this, don&#39;t know where,<br />    possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.<br />    <br />    A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />    better, naamam or thiruneeru.

Do keep<br />      this going.<br />      If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />      seeing this topic the<br />      Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming &#40;no<br />      offence, just a joke&#41;.<br />      This happens when my father and my family friend<br />      &#40;the one i was talking<br />      about earlier&#41; start having a chat about thier visit<br />      to the meenakshi<br />      temple.

In the name of democracy and<br />      openess of society we seem<br />      to take too much of a liberty.

The<br />      thenkalais claim that<br />        vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />      after Ramanuja, but<br />        only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />      the Guruparampara.<br />        The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />      from Pillai<br />        Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br />       <br />        This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />      to accept the<br />        other&#39;s views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />      if one enters into a<br />        philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />      small writeup<br />        regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />      personal mails on that<br />        debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />      here. Ofcourse, it is<br />        subject to a debate.<br />       <br />        Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />      for 120 years. He<br />        attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />      are the timelines<br />        which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />       <br />        Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />      link to the<br />        Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />      happened later, though<br />        within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />      saying that<br />        Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />      from the sea and got<br />        it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />      sure, how he was<br />        reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />      somewhere &#40;may be in<br />        this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated during<br />      the times of Nayak<br />        kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />      Chitrakoodam.<br />       <br />        Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />      neither acting as<br />        Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />      of the Temple of<br />        Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />      mention in the<br />        history.<br />       <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />       <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />      ,<br />        "R.venketesh" <br />        wrote: <br />         <br />          Hi<br />          so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />         <br />          i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41;<br />      instruments used on ramanuja<br />          himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />      discovered in a<br />          secret chamber in the last decade<br />         <br />          .
