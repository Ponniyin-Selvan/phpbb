			<div class="content">Hi Satish/Diwakar,<br /><br />Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the growth of hypocritical people..<br /><br />I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism grew because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of being a priest. why can't our madams and adheenams take over that role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the person is willing to perform his duties..<br /><br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br />Dhiwakar  wrote:<br /><br />satish....<br /><br />nee andha padathoda second part paakalai nnu ninaikkaren.... anyway,<br />if nagarajan was a chozhan obviously his son is also a chozhan..<br />eppdi madakkinen paathiyaa....<br /><br />though we might not know clearly the name of the son, we cannot call<br />chozha dynasty as extinct....<br /><br />enakku soru pottaa mattum dhaan avarukku dhanda selavu nnu yaaru<br />sonnaa???!!! evvalavo irukku.. adhai naan unakkum sps sirkkum mattum<br />mail anuppi theriyapadutharen.!!! unakku slightaa purinjirukkume<br />ippave?!!!<br /><br />naan ellaam member illappa....ennai group-prashtam panni pala days<br />aaidchchu... idhey maadhiri experience thanakkum irukku nnu vera oru<br />member kooda varuthapattu ezhudhikiraaru!!! vilanguchchaaa???? aa<br />jinguchaa!!!<br /><br />aana oru vishayam correctaa sonnappa nee....<br /><br />eththini dhabaa poi aaraaichi pannaalum periya koil eppadi<br />kattinaanga nnu kandu pudikka vakkillai dhaan namakku....naamalum<br />aaraichi pannom, pannikinu irukkom , innum pannuvom...<br /><br />"oorukaai" maadhiri namma seiyyaradhum oru "vinaithogai" aaidchchu..<br /><br />pirachanai ennanna... people take a lot of things personally ...<br /><br />"ramana " padathula andha "singh police" solluvaan...andha maadhiri<br />dhaan....<br /><br />andha distinction namakku therlai... vivaadhathai personalaa<br />eduthukkaraanga....this applies to one and all including me...<br /><br />naama ellaarum idhey topic ai niraiya dhadavai group la pesi ketta<br />peru vaanghirukkom .... hope u remember...<br /><br />aryan dravidan theory, hindu muslim christians theory ellaam romba<br />romba personalaa eduthukkaraanga....<br /><br />but anyway, hindus ai kurai solradhu mattum summaa ellaa edathulayum<br />jarooraa nadakkudhu....<br /><br />once karunanidhi told that he does not worship pillaiyar becoz<br />pillaiyar is not from tamizhnadu.. he is from "vatapi" (taken from<br />sivakamiyin sabatham)...<br /><br />he calls pillaiyar as aryan god and other nonsense....<br /><br />but idhey aalu goes to iftar party , church ellaam .... adhu eppdi<br />if pillaiyar does not belong to tamilnadu, does jesus and the prophet<br />belong to TN?? weird....<br /><br />indha maadhiri aalungalaala dhaan aryan-dravidian theory still<br />rules.... vivekanandar during his period (more than 100 yers back)<br />denounced this theory.... enna oru dheerga dharisanam..<br /><br />he clearly said that there is no such thing as invasion theory... it<br />is the handiwork of westeners..<br /><br />this theory and other interpretations of sanskrit literature is based<br />purely upon "Max mueller's" translation... nobody knows how far it is<br />accurate... might be mr. max had true and genuine intentions.. but<br />how far therse are correct nobody knows...<br /><br />for example frawley says the word "samudram" doesnt mean "sea<br />alone"... it indicates a large water body.. but it is still<br />interpreted as sea...<br /><br />idhellam sonnaa namma makkal nammalai "thirumba pirachanai panna<br />vandhuttaan" nnu solluvaanga... idhellaam namakku<br />pazhagipochchuppaa....<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dhiwakar,<br /> <br />  Back to form.aa...good..Nagaraja chozhan also was killed<br />  Dhiwa...pakkara padatha ozhunga pakkanum.<br /> <br />  pavam sps...unakku oc soru potta avaru soththu kali...I would<br />suggest,<br />  expense diveded by all except SPS. oru tharavayavathu nama selavu<br />  panni avaru sapidatume...<br /> <br />  Re.

			<div class="content">Hi Nanda,<br />Good point. This has been discussed in length many a times. Hinduism <br />or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa and <br />many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were brahmins <br />by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned the <br />trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that there <br />is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives for <br />more heated debates on this (Priya vaishnava enga <br />poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />neenga mudikaliya)<br /><br />I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But you <br />call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta kalamda <br />sami...<br /><br />anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A welcome <br />rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone who <br />is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />atchi kavundhudum.<br /><br />And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. references <br />to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and conquered <br />india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the varnasrama <br />dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />country. <br /><br />ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states that <br />only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these theory <br />says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans eppadi <br />sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />brahmins. engiyo idikala...<br /><br />and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh always <br />says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference to <br />the word 'dravida' or any war between tamil kings and aryan kings? I <br />am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There should <br />be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, even a <br />theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />indians(as the article states in many places) which we fail or <br />rather dont want to think about. <br /><br />How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly come <br />and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer it <br />etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our culture. <br />Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non brahmins <br />call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules cannot <br />change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. 'Dalit <br />can become santhome church father' cannot fetch vote- it will only <br />split vote. <br /><br />As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />topics .moooch... <br /><br />Venkatesh, <br />I think I discussed with you about 'Paramartha Guru' stories in one <br />of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil' by <br />Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. Hidden <br />agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu saints. <br />Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden agenda <br />of conversion (missionary activities mentioned at many places in the <br />article). So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the impact <br />is seen even today. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Satish/Diwakar,<br />     <br />  Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a <br />culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the</div></blockquote>growth of hypocritical people.. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about <br />non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one</div></blockquote>thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism grew <br />because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, <br />thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a <br />priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and <br />is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of <br />being a priest. why can't our madams and adheenams take over that <br />role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion <br />amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the <br />person is willing to perform his duties..<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Regards<br />  Nanda</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Wow...We have come a long way. Even if half of our members are active we are doing a great job. For those of you who have no clue of who i'm--I'm one of those earliest members who joined when Ram started this group. Hats off to Ram. I went back in time to find out how all this started and found a interesting thing. The predecessor to this group was a discussion thread in forum hub. When Ram started this group many replies in that forum were skeptical about it success and Ram was sure about the groups success. Without any doubt his conviction proved right. Even with the new group we were tryingto do a lot of stuff and going no where. With the help of our members like SPS, Dr.Sridhar, Gokul, Lavanya and lot others (due to lack of space i'm leaving out some names) we now have a direction. Even to this day, i use our group as an example of team work in our executive meetings. From: my personal experience i would say people like me don't post a lot but remain active. I don't post any replies not because of disinterest , because ...Enakku onnumae theriyadhu <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />. Even our Krupa seems to slowed down these days. I really hope our group moves to the next level as PSPV and becomes a name to recon with when it comes to dealing with Tamil history and heritage. With distinguished members like SPS sir, i'm sure we will get there.<br /> <br />Finally - AAdI 18 VAZHTHUKKAL (Appada... now i'm an active member)<br /> <br />Note: In case if someone is wondering about my contribution to this group -Bunch of failed attachment mails to Sathya and spoiling Krupa's career with an OCR. <br />Thanks,<br />Arul Prasad<br /> <br /><br /><br />To:  ponniyinselvan@...: sps10142004@...: Mon, 17 Jul 2006 12:40:08 +0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] MEMBERSHIP<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "s.balasubramani"  wrote:Dear Friends, Our membership is approaching 950.

This has been discussed in length many a times. <br />Hinduism <br />  or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />  any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa <br />and <br />  many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were brahmins <br />  by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned the <br />  trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that there <br />  is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives for <br />  more heated debates on this &#40;Priya vaishnava enga <br />  poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />  varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />  neenga mudikaliya&#41;<br />  <br />  I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />  and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />  can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />  round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />  both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But you <br />  call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta kalamda <br />  sami...<br />  <br />  anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A welcome <br />  rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone <br />who <br />  is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />  atchi kavundhudum.<br />  <br />  And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. references <br />  to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />  again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />  being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />  advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and conquered <br />  india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the <br />varnasrama <br />  dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />  brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />  are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />  country. <br />  <br />  ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states <br />that <br />  only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these <br />theory <br />  says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />  literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans eppadi <br />  sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />  brahmins. engiyo idikala...<br />  <br />  and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />  erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh always <br />  says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />  Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference to <br />  the word &#39;dravida&#39; or any war between tamil kings and aryan kings? <br />I <br />  am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There <br />should <br />  be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />  consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />  neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />  anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, even <br />a <br />  theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />  sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />  indians&#40;as the article states in many places&#41; which we fail or <br />  rather dont want to think about. <br />  <br />  How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly <br />come <br />  and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />  the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />  where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />  crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />  replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />  foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer it <br />  etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />  brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our <br />culture. <br />  Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />  brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non brahmins <br />  call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />  and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules <br />cannot <br />  change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />  for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. &#39;Dalit <br />  can become santhome church father&#39; cannot fetch vote- it will only <br />  split vote. <br />  <br />  As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />  topics .moooch... <br />  <br />  Venkatesh, <br />  I think I discussed with you about &#39;Paramartha Guru&#39; stories in one <br />  of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil&#39; by <br />  Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. Hidden <br />  agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu saints. <br />  Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden agenda <br />  of conversion &#40;missionary activities mentioned at many places in <br />the <br />  article&#41;. So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />  easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the <br />impact <br />  is seen even today. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi Satish/Diwakar,<br />       <br />    Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a <br />  culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the <br />  growth of hypocritical people.. <br />       <br />    I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about <br />  non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one <br />  thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism <br />grew <br />  because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, <br />  thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a <br />  priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and <br />  is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of <br />  being a priest. why can&#39;t our madams and adheenams take over that <br />  role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion <br />  amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the <br />  person is willing to perform his duties..<br />       <br />    Regards<br />    Nanda</div></blockquote></div>

I went back in time to find out <br />how all this started and found a interesting thing. The predecessor <br />to this group was a discussion thread in forum hub. When Ram started <br />this group many replies in that forum were skeptical about it <br />success and Ram was sure about the groups success. Without any doubt <br />his conviction proved right. Even with the new group we were trying <br />to do a lot of stuff and going no where. With the help of our  <br />members like SPS, Dr.Sridhar, Gokul, Lavanya and lot others (due to <br />lack of space i'm leaving out some names) we now have a direction. <br />Even to this day, i use our group as an example of team work in our <br />executive meetings. From: my personal experience i would say people <br />like me don't post a lot but remain active. I don't post any replies <br />not because of disinterest , because ...Enakku onnumae theriyadhu :-<br />). Even our Krupa seems to slowed down these days. I really hope our <br />group moves to the next level as PSPV and becomes a name to recon <br />with when it comes to dealing with Tamil history and heritage.
