			<div class="content">It might be true that successful women needs a backing from Spouse / father / Mentor or that could even be her mother, friend or someone. It holds good for men also. You have a popular saying 'There is a woman behind every successful man'. Because this is a inter-related or even you can say inter-dependent society. But still there are some women and men who have succeeded by themselves (at least as far as we know that they are not dependent on anyone) like Mother Teresa, Abdul Kalaam etc., But since this is a male-dominated society, may be the proportion that are dependent would be greater for women.<br /><br />Still most of the conservative families believe that responsibilities of the family like looking after the children etc., is believed to be a women's job rather than men's, although both should have the same responsibility. Women are expected to give preference to this rather than her career. Although most of the women can succeed in their carrier by themselves, its true that her husband has to share these family responsibilities, so that she could concentrate on her career. Its the same for men. If a wife depends on husband for all the house-hold jobs leaving little time for him to concentrate in his career, its obvious that he can't succeed in it.<br /><br />Priya<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Udanx <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Sunday, September 7, 2008 3:35:33 AM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Men's mind set about women's self-respect<br /><br /><br />Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their professional life. After K.V Kamath, till recently all the three No.2 in ICICI Bank were women. Also another fact about women is that without a backing Spouse / father / Mentor (Male) no women has won even a panjayat election. This was way back in early 90s when my English Professor quoted a research paper. Not sure whether that holds good even today.<br /><br /><br />~ Udanx</div>

			<div class="content">On the other hand, we also should look at the plus and minus Nature<br />has given us. Even if the male is ready to share the responsibility of<br />household and bringing up children, the care that a mother gives can<br />never be compared to that of the father. Not only humans, we can see<br />this in every species. A women can raise her children without a males<br />support but its next to impossible for a man to raise his children<br />without a female support. Exceptions are there, but still in general,<br />'nallavar aavathum theeyavar aavathum annai valarpinile' and not<br />thanthai valarpinile....<br />Thats why in India, we worship mother and see everything in female<br />form too...our contry is motherland and not fatherland for the obvious<br />reasons..<br /><br />A women can excel in career, but a man cannot excel in bringing up the<br />child or a good home maker..<br /><br />my two paise worth...<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Yes Definitely I agree there are things that men and women can do <br />better, child rearing happens to be one of them. Although in advanced <br />countries stay at home dads are very common and earning moms too. <br />Germany for example. Germany is also called fatherland btw <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />).<br /><br />I was talking of femininity also perhaps in the same context. Most <br />people think of women leaders as the stereotype Indira Gandhi/JJ model -<br />aggressive, ruthless and somewhat lacking in or ashamed of nurturing <br />skills. Bringing emotion into the workplace is often branded 'feminine' <br />and both men and women are branded 'softies' if they are caring, <br />nurturing,respect others and do not conform to stereotyped models of <br />leadership. <br /><br />One of my favorite female leadership role models happens to be media <br />queen Oprah Winfrey. Oprah is not aggressive in public, does not <br />hesitate to show emotion and caring, and yet is a very successful <br />business woman and role model. Some virtues to learn from...</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Satish,<br />I definitely dont agree your thought about men not excelling in taking care<br />of children.<br />My father is a living example of that.<br />having lost our mother at the tender age of 8 and 11 respectively, me and my<br />bro were brought up by my dad. And seriously we have not missed our mom till<br />date.<br />both of us are in a very good position now and we owe it all to our dad!<br />Hats off to him!<br /><br />So i guess we can never generalize anything when it comes to human nature.<br />It depends so much on a person's upbringing, inidvidual characteristic.<br />Havent we seen cases were when a single mother fights teh society to bring<br />up her children but fails miserably.. (may be due to various reasons which<br />she may not be solely responsible.)<br /><br />I do agree that a happy family is one where there's both mom and dad to<br />shower their affection on kids along with grandparents to impart their<br />wisdom.<br />But ofcourse, we dont live in a perfect world!<br /><br />As for man backing a woman or vice-versa, I strongly believe it goes hand in<br />hand.<br />Be whatever be their career, i guess all the responsibilities are to be<br />shared by both in other to cope in a fast paced world where we need to<br />juggle with career, child care, home needs etc.<br />Times have changed now, with all the globalization, most of us into the IT<br />industry, are used to staying alone in foriegn countries. So there is no<br />excuse for a guy or a gal for not participating in household chores.. coz<br />they've already done it before!<br />So everything sums up to shredding off ego and share ur life with ur<br />partner.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />On Tue, Sep 9, 2008 at 12:37 AM, SatishKumar Arunachalam <<br />satisharun@...  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>On the other hand, we also should look at the plus and minus Nature<br />  has given us. Even if the male is ready to share the responsibility of<br />  household and bringing up children, the care that a mother gives can<br />  never be compared to that of the father. Not only humans, we can see<br />  this in every species. A women can raise her children without a males<br />  support but its next to impossible for a man to raise his children<br />  without a female support. Exceptions are there, but still in general,<br />  &#39;nallavar aavathum theeyavar aavathum annai valarpinile&#39; and not<br />  thanthai valarpinile....<br />  Thats why in India, we worship mother and see everything in female<br />  form too...our contry is motherland and not fatherland for the obvious<br />  reasons..<br /> <br />  A women can excel in career, but a man cannot excel in bringing up the<br />  child or a good home maker..<br /> <br />  my two paise worth...<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">SPS,<br /><br />Let your wife take a bow from me. I salute that lady who had been a<br />visionary about real estates. But again the sample size is small from your<br />end as well. Both the parties can keep on quoting examples which will keep<br />this thread active for sometime. But I trust thats not the motive of this<br />thread.<br /><br />In one of my earlier mails in this thread I have accepted that given the<br />freedom and suport women can shine in their fields and I quoted the case of<br />ICICI Bank. I will go even a step ahead, with the support and freeodm woman<br />out class / out smart men. But it is mandatory for ALL SUCESSFUL woman that<br />she gets freedom and support.<br /><br />Where as MOST OF THE SUCESSFUL MEN didnt need support from woman. This is my<br />observation about the society. If I am proved wrong I am ready to eat my<br />words. After all this group is for learning new things / sharing ideas and<br />knowledge.<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />*Thats the end of my mail for woman folks*<br /><br /><br />Guys,<br /><br />It may be noted that behind every bright man's failure in life / business<br />there is definetly a woman's hand!<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />PS: I am that my inbox will be bombarded with feminist in our group for the<br />previous line. Lunch @ Andra Mess and Curd rice in action ... Kanna Kattudhu<br />... So thought of writing a mail which will keep me awake for some time now!<br />Velila Ore Mazha What to do?<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>
