			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Interested to know the cost of living in chozhar kalam: from below <br />inscription:<br /><br /><br />These endowments were made in the following manner. Kundavaiyar <br />deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were subsequently <br />borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain villages from the <br />shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose name the <br />money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[3] The interest <br />had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the Rajarajesvara temple <br />at Tanjavur either in paddy[4] or in money. In the former case, the <br />interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in the latter <br />12Ã‚Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest was the same <br />in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of 24 kuruni <br />or 2 kalam of paddy . <br /><br />one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got you 192 kilos <br />of rice....wow<br /><br />In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was deposited for <br />purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two private <br />individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee for lamps.<br />[5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. Or one Kasu <br />got you 3 sheep.<br /><br />3 sheep = 192 kilosof rice.<br /><br />How does it compare with current day kasu, cost of kilo of rice and <br />one sheep...<br /><br /><br />Tamil Inscriptions<br /><br />part - i<br /><br />INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TANJAVUR TEMPLE<br /><br />INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE<br /><br />No. 6 On the South Wall second tier<br /><br />This and the next inscription, though of different date, are <br />engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the whole of the <br />first section and part of the first line of the second section.<br /><br />The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were made until <br />the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the elder <br />sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar. <br />As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was the son of <br />Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, Parantakan <br />Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal Kundavaiyar, <br />i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).<br /><br />Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two goddesses, who <br />are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to paragraph 1, <br />these two images had been set up in the temple of Rajarajesvara by <br />Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an image of her <br />mother, to which she presented certain ornaments (paragraphs 3 to <br />5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god Dakshina-Meru-<br />Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by king <br />Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs 8 and 9), <br />who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph 2. The <br />remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these two <br />goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of Ponmaligaittunjina-devar <br />(paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of Kundavaiyar <br />(paragraph 19).</div>

			<div class="content">one theory for the english word CASH<br /><br />The word was formerly used also to refer to certain low-value coins <br />used in South and East Asia.

But this time, it triggered off with the gold <br />coinage to initiate major transactions. Soon silver and copper <br />coinage were minted in plenty to meet the day to day needs of <br />commodities. <br /><br />Raja raja Chola struck coins both in Sri Lanka and India. They <br />differed much in fabric, style and in the gold purity. The monetary <br />economy was well defined with the Imperial Cholan conquest. In <br />Tamilnadu, Cholas introduced coinage much prior to Raja raja's <br />campaign in Sri Lanka. They adopted 'Tiger facing two fishes' as <br />their emblem on the coinage. Having developed a strong navy, they <br />traded with Sri Lanka and soon conquered them too. They also set <br />voyages as far as the islands of Indonesia and Maldives through <br />ocean. Subsequently they felt the need to mint coins to trade! <br /><br />Chola's coinage issues were in all the three metals Gold, Silver and <br />Copper. Though the coinage was mainly destined for general <br />currency, very few commemoratives could be observed. Uttama Chola <br />struck silver with the royal emblem of "Tiger facing two fishes" on <br />the obverse and the Nagari legend "Uttama Chola". Raja Raja struck <br />gld fanams bearing the legend Yuddha Malla" on the obverse and the <br />usual insignia on the reverse. He also struck silver and gold <br />kahavanus with the standing king on the obverse and the seated king <br />on the reverse. Nagari legend "Raja Raja" surrounded him on the <br />obverse of some types, and the reverse image of some types. <br /><br />Rajendra Chola struck coins with the legend "Sri Rajendrah" beneath <br />the usual insignia on both reverse and obverse. The copper Kasu of <br />Chola started off with the reign of Raja Raja, which passed onto <br />next generations (even Kulottunga) with the same standard "Standing <br />King on the obverse" and "Seated King on the reverse". Sometime <br />legend "Raja Raja" and sometime the legend "Ku appears on the <br />coinage surroundig the image. These coins can be seen abundantly as <br />the same type of coins with little deformed images were circulated <br />till the Cholas ceased to exist. <br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>ANACONDA<br />  <br />  There are two possible origins for the word &#39;anaconda,&#39; both of <br />which <br />  are traced to the languages of Sri Lanka: It is perhaps an <br />  alteration of the Sinhalese word &#39;henakanday&#39;, meaning &#39;thunder <br />  snake&#39;, or alternatively, the Tamil word &#39;anaikondran&#39;, which <br />means <br />  &#39;elephant killer&#39;. <br />  there are no anacondas in sri lanka<br />  It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake&#39;s <br />native <br />  habitat; it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large <br />Asian <br />  pythons and portugese conquests in these two corners of the earth<br />  <br />  Local names for the anaconda in South America include the Spanish <br />  term matatoro, meaning &#39;bull killer&#39;,<br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar<br />  .S"  wrote:<br />   <br />    agni - ignis - ignite    <br />    thekku - teak  <br />    arisi -rice    <br />    aanai kolran - anai kondan &#40; elephant killer&#41; anaconda   <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      one theory for the english word CASH<br />      <br />      The word was formerly used also to refer to certain low-value <br />    coins <br />      used in South and East Asia.

But this time, it triggered off with the gold <br />  coinage to initiate major transactions. Soon silver and copper <br />  coinage were minted in plenty to meet the day to day needs of <br />  commodities. <br />  <br />  Raja raja Chola struck coins both in Sri Lanka and India. They <br />  differed much in fabric, style and in the gold purity. The <br />monetary <br />  economy was well defined with the Imperial Cholan conquest. In <br />  Tamilnadu, Cholas introduced coinage much prior to Raja raja&#39;s <br />  campaign in Sri Lanka. They adopted &#39;Tiger facing two fishes&#39; as <br />  their emblem on the coinage. Having developed a strong navy, they <br />  traded with Sri Lanka and soon conquered them too. They also set <br />  voyages as far as the islands of Indonesia and Maldives through <br />  ocean. Subsequently they felt the need to mint coins to trade! <br />  <br />  Chola&#39;s coinage issues were in all the three metals Gold, Silver <br />and <br />  Copper. Though the coinage was mainly destined for general <br />  currency, very few commemoratives could be observed. Uttama Chola <br />  struck silver with the royal emblem of "Tiger facing two fishes" <br />on <br />  the obverse and the Nagari legend "Uttama Chola". Raja Raja <br />struck <br />  gld fanams bearing the legend Yuddha Malla" on the obverse and the <br />  usual insignia on the reverse. He also struck silver and gold <br />  kahavanus with the standing king on the obverse and the seated <br />king <br />  on the reverse. Nagari legend "Raja Raja" surrounded him on the <br />  obverse of some types, and the reverse image of some types. <br />  <br />  Rajendra Chola struck coins with the legend "Sri Rajendrah" <br />beneath <br />  the usual insignia on both reverse and obverse. The copper Kasu <br />of <br />  Chola started off with the reign of Raja Raja, which passed onto <br />  next generations &#40;even Kulottunga&#41; with the same <br />standard "Standing <br />  King on the obverse" and "Seated King on the reverse". Sometime <br />  legend "Raja Raja" and sometime the legend "Ku appears on the <br />  coinage surroundig the image. These coins can be seen abundantly <br />as <br />  the same type of coins with little deformed images were circulated <br />  till the Cholas ceased to exist. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    ANACONDA<br />    <br />    There are two possible origins for the word &#39;anaconda,&#39; both of <br />  which <br />    are traced to the languages of Sri Lanka: It is perhaps an <br />    alteration of the Sinhalese word &#39;henakanday&#39;, meaning &#39;thunder <br />    snake&#39;, or alternatively, the Tamil word &#39;anaikondran&#39;, which <br />  means <br />    &#39;elephant killer&#39;. <br />    there are no anacondas in sri lanka<br />    It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake&#39;s <br />  native <br />    habitat; it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large <br />  Asian <br />    pythons and portugese conquests in these two corners of the earth<br />    <br />    Local names for the anaconda in South America include the <br />Spanish <br />    term matatoro, meaning &#39;bull killer&#39;,<br />    venketesh<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar<br />    .S"  wrote:<br />     <br />      agni - ignis - ignite    <br />      thekku - teak  <br />      arisi -rice    <br />      aanai kolran - anai kondan &#40; elephant killer&#41; anaconda   <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        one theory for the english word CASH<br />        <br />        The word was formerly used also to refer to certain low-<br />value <br />      coins <br />        used in South and East Asia.

These coins can be seen <br />abundantly <br />  as <br />    the same type of coins with little deformed images were <br />circulated <br />    till the Cholas ceased to exist. <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      ANACONDA<br />      <br />      There are two possible origins for the word &#39;anaconda,&#39; both <br />of <br />    which <br />      are traced to the languages of Sri Lanka: It is perhaps an <br />      alteration of the Sinhalese word &#39;henakanday&#39;, <br />meaning &#39;thunder <br />      snake&#39;, or alternatively, the Tamil word &#39;anaikondran&#39;, which <br />    means <br />      &#39;elephant killer&#39;. <br />      there are no anacondas in sri lanka<br />      It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake&#39;s <br />    native <br />      habitat; it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large <br />    Asian <br />      pythons and portugese conquests in these two corners of the <br />earth<br />      <br />      Local names for the anaconda in South America include the <br />  Spanish <br />      term matatoro, meaning &#39;bull killer&#39;,<br />      venketesh<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar<br />      .S"  wrote:<br />       <br />        agni - ignis - ignite    <br />        thekku - teak  <br />        arisi -rice    <br />        aanai kolran - anai kondan &#40; elephant killer&#41; anaconda   <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />         wrote:<br />         <br />          one theory for the english word CASH<br />          <br />          The word was formerly used also to refer to certain low-<br />  value <br />        coins <br />          used in South and East Asia. This sense derives from the <br />  Tamil <br />        k&#257;su, <br />          a South Indian monetary unit.

In the pre-1818 South Indian monetary system, the <br />  cash <br />    was <br />        the <br />          basic coin, with 80 cash equalling a fanam and 42 fanams <br />      equalling <br />        a <br />          star pagoda worth roughly 7s. 8d.[3]<br />          <br />          This assimilated Tamil word was then applied to various <br />  other <br />        coins <br />          with which European traders came into contact, including <br />the <br />        famous <br />          holed cash coins of China, the Chinese cash.

In the <br />former <br />    case, <br />        the <br />            interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in <br />  the <br />        latter <br />            12Ã‚Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest <br />was <br />    the <br />        same <br />            in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of <br />  24 <br />        kuruni <br />            or 2 kalam of paddy . <br />            <br />            one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got <br />you <br />    192 <br />        kilos <br />            of rice....wow<br />            <br />            In two instances &#40;paragraphs 18 and 21&#41;, money was <br />  deposited <br />      for <br />            purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two <br />      private <br />            individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee <br />  for <br />        lamps.<br />            [5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu.

No. 6 fills the <br />  whole <br />    of <br />        the <br />            first section and part of the first line of the second <br />    section.<br />            <br />            The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were <br />  made <br />        until <br />            the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />            Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was <br />the <br />      elder <br />            sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar <br />        Vandyadevar. <br />            As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was <br />  the <br />      son <br />        of <br />            Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, <br />        Parantakan <br />            Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal <br />        Kundavaiyar, <br />            i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka &#40;II.&#41;.<br />            <br />            Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two <br />    goddesses, <br />        who <br />            are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to <br />      paragraph <br />        1, <br />            these two images had been set up in the temple of <br />    Rajarajesvara <br />        by <br />            Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an <br />image <br />    of <br />        her <br />            mother, to which she presented certain ornaments <br />  &#40;paragraphs <br />    3 <br />        to <br />            5&#41;. Other ornaments were given to the image of the god <br />    Dakshina-<br />          Meru-<br />            Vitankar &#40;paragraphs 6 and 7&#41;, which had been set up by <br />  king <br />            Rajarajadeva &#40;paragraph 1&#41;, and to his consort <br />&#40;paragraphs <br />  8 <br />      and <br />          9&#41;, <br />            who was one of the two goddesses referred to in <br />paragraph <br />  2. <br />      The <br />            remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to <br />these <br />    two <br />            goddesses &#40;paragraph 10&#41;, to the image of <br />  Ponmaligaittunjina-<br />        devar <br />            &#40;paragraph 14&#41;, and to the image of the mother of <br />    Kundavaiyar <br />            &#40;paragraph 19&#41;.</div></blockquote></div>
