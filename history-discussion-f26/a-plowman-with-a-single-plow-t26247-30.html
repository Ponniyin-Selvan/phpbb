			<div class="content">Dear Vijay,<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - meaning <br />  its is not treated as moolavar &#40; if in stone&#41; or utsavar &#40; if <br />metal&#41; <br />  just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings &#40; ok - you may <br />  call it rituals&#41; - which are performed to infuse the idol with the <br />  qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />  plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to <br />temple <br />  sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</div></blockquote>While it is true that certain rituals called "prathistai" makes the <br />idol get the Godly powers, it is also true that the God is <br />Omnipresent. He also manifests in every form that his devotee thinks <br />of Him. Remember the pAsuram from Prabhandham that I quoted during <br />discussion on Ramanuja ("thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam <br />thAnE.."). That was a Vaishnavite work. I am pretty sure that the <br />same would have been said by Nayanmars as well. Afterall, keeping <br />aside certain High level philosophies and the Supreme God <br />differences, the AzhwArs and Nayanmars talk about the same love and <br />devotion. <br /><br />Just to substantiate this, are we not seeing so many sculptures in <br />the pillars of a temple being worshipped as Gods by devotees out of <br />love and affection. These sculptures are not consecrated. Still they <br />go about doing pradhakshiNam or kaRpUra hArathi for these. This is <br />what is signified in the pAsuram "thamar ugandhadhu...". So the <br />words of Kannadasan as quoted by Malathi "Kadavul enru pArthAl, <br />kadavuL, silai endru pArthAl silai" is exactly in the same lines.<br /><br />In fact the lines of KD as quoted by Malathi, "uNdu enRAl uNdu, <br />illai endrAl illai" is also sung by NammAzhwAr in ThiruvAimozhi, <br /><br />"uLan enil uLan, avan uruvam ivvuruvugaL<br />uLan alan enil, avan aruvam ivvaruvugaL<br />uLanena ilanena ivai guNamudaimayin<br />uLaniru thagaimaiOdu ozhivilan paranthE"<br /><br />Similarly regarding the "satha kooru", the very next pAsuram says<br /><br />"parantha thaN paRavayuL nIr thorum parandhuLan<br />parantha aNdamidhena, nila visumbu ozhivara<br />karantha sil idanthorum idam thigazh poruLthorum<br />karandhengum parandhuLan ivayuNda suranE"<br /><br />That He is omnipresent in every water, land, sky and everything that <br />is manifest and unmanifest is signified here. The upanishads, <br />glorify this aspect of the Supreme God as "aNoraNIyAn mahatho <br />mahIyAn". He is the smallest of the smallest atom and the largest of <br />the largest thing to exist in the universe".<br /><br />Taking this into cognizance, it wouldn't be unfair to say that if <br />one sees a sculpture as a true god, it indeed becomes one, no matter <br />if the ritualistic consecration is done or not.<br /><br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves - <br />  to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools <br />of <br />  thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a fistfull <br />  of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay.</div></blockquote>Very well said Vijay. This is exactly what I tried to describe above.<br /><br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in <br />front <br />  of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers were <br />  deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of <br />suggestion -<br />  but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />  just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />  and not the location.</div></blockquote>Again another well said sentence and I was meaning this too above. <br />While I am not greater authority than you to certify you, I only <br />wanted to substantiate these words, by providing certain references <br />to the spiritual scriptures. So please do not mistake me as I am <br />trying to certify you.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</div>

			<div class="content">Vairam,<br /><br />Well said!! I am very much with you on this. Just to corroborate, we <br />all know the story of ManakkOil koNda MaNikkanAr. It is know to all <br />that God, just ignored the temple built by the king and placed <br />Himself in the heart of this devotee. Yes, it is the BhAvam of Love <br />and Servitude, which is important here.<br /><br />Again another quote from NammAzhwar. He says<br /><br />"poosum sAndhu en nenjamE, punayun kaNNi enadhuyirE<br />vAsagam sei mAlayE vAn pattAdayum agdhE<br />thEsamAna aNigalanum en kai kooppuch cheigayE <br />Isan gnyAlam uNdu umizhndha endhai Eka mUrthikkE".<br /><br />This situation is a similar blissful situation like Andal <br />experienced. Here the Azhwar goes to the extent of saying that his <br />Heart is the Sandhanam, and his Life is the Poem, and chanting His <br />names is the Garland etc.... At this state, it does not matter, <br />whether the Idol is consecrated or not. He (Nammazhwar) even goes to <br />the extent of saying <br /><br />"uNNum sORu, parugum nIr, thinnum vetRilai, ellam kaNNan.." and <br />obviously we do not consecrate these vasthus.

There was also a beautiful<br />    stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era<br />    <br />    Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the Uma paramershwari <br />idol<br />    was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt allow us to take<br />    pictures of this one alone...<br />    <br />    The beauty of this piece was breathtaking - more than the aura <br />of <br />    seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over 1000 years ago - the <br />    sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell bound. statue was at <br />    best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was exqusite...the <br />grace <br />    and calm of herface and love in the smile, the lovely locks of <br />her <br />    hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her sholders..the <br />intricate <br />    ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise - the gentle sway <br />    acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful and elaborate work <br />on <br />    his lower garments..her hands and fingers bring life to the <br />    figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic beauty with <br />    spirituality - the experience left me spell bound - which is <br />what <br />    the original chola patrons would have wanted the image to do...<br />    <br />    this is the image...<br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.acm.org.sg/exhibitions/eventdetail.asp?eventID=184">http://www.acm.org.sg/exhibitions/event ... ventID=184</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    enjoy<br />    <br />    vj</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Ravi,<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam<br />  <br />  Again, neenga conceptually different people comparison panaringa...<br />  Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally wrong.<br />  Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion itself. She, if <br />I <br />  am allowed to say, is greater than Ranganatha himself. As with <br />Valli, <br />  where it is said &#39;Kura magal iru patham paritha sekara&#39;, devotion <br />has <br />  that respect with the greater spiritual plane.<br />  <br />  Ayana sirpi&#39;s love for sculpture is dazzled when sivakami is lost. <br />  Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.</div></blockquote>May be true. But until the conclusion happened, i.e, losing <br />sivakami, definitely Ayana siRpi's passion was the same as that of <br />Andal. Only the end result can compared for quality. Otherwise the <br />thought or passion in both is the same. It is only the strength and <br />determination which was present in Andal is missing in Ayana siRpi. <br />That does not mean that his passion, when exhibited, was impure.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In any form, Andal&#39;s poo malai or paa malai, never die with time, <br />but <br />  Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />  Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any human work, <br />however <br />  art &#40;poo malai - paa malai etc&#41; devoted in the service of God, is <br />  immortal.</div></blockquote>I beg to differ here. Here is where, the spirituality comes into <br />fore. Nammazhwar says ".... un manathAl en ninaindhirundhAi ivaL <br />thiRathu en seiginRAyE". This is one of the life lines of <br />Vaishnavite Philosophy. This says that what ever happens in the <br />world is due to Gods Sankalpam, i.e, His desire and determination. <br />So if Andal's pA mAlai did not die with time, it is His grace, and <br />if Ayana siRpi's sculpture is lost, it is also destined by Him. <br /><br />Atleast for now, both Andal's pAmAlai and Ayana siRi's kal malai are <br />co-existing. We do not know about the future. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />PS: Andal's Poo malai, though is lost now. <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />  <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to guide us on Andal, i <br />am <br />  too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai, even to think <br />of <br />  her as human.<br />  <br />  -- R</div></blockquote>Ha Ha Ha, if this is intended towards me, I am no expert Ravi. I <br />mean this. However, from an unbiased view point, especially when you <br />compare Andal and Ayana siRpi, I believe, they both had great <br />passions on their objectives, only that Andal was more determined <br />and the destiny favoured Her ("un manathAl en ninaindhirundhAi") <br />while Ayana siRpi was less determined and so was his destiny. We can <br />easily compare the passion of both. Andal's passion made her go <br />against the ritualistic practice of not adorning the garland, before <br />offering it to God, while Ayana siRpi's passion, made him mad, even <br />to the extent that he struck a deal with the enemy of His king <br />(Mahendravarman) who he respected so much. <br /><br />This is height of devotion. Not knowing what one does out of great <br />devotion. Periyazhwar, father of Andal, incidentally describes this <br />state of mind in his periyAzhwAr thirumozhi says "atthA ariyE endRu <br />nAn azhaithAl, pithA enbar piRar..."<br /><br />Thirumangai Azhwar personifies this state of bliss, unmindful of the <br />worldly logics, that he even went to the extent of performing "madal <br />eduthal". Actually, madal eduthal, as per the Tamizh Ilakkiyams is <br />ordained only for the male, who will wear a garland out of the palm <br />leaf and sit on a Donkey and go around the town saying that the <br />women he loves does not turn her eyes towards him. This is something <br />like emotional black mail. The reason I say that Thirumangai Azhwar <br />went against the norm is that, he had sung the two <br />prabhandhams "siRiya thirumaDal" and "periya thirumaDal" in nAyaki <br />bhAvam, means, thinking of him as a women. So a women should not be <br />doing this as per the customs prevalent in those times. But his love <br />for reaching God and the frustration that He is not showing up, made <br />him go well against the customs and rituals, prevalent at those <br />times.<br /><br />So the Love, Devotion towards God are in one's thought and no <br />customs and rituals can stipulate a boundary for these, when the <br />jeevAtmA goes into a state of eternal bliss.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</div>
