			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by singanallur ramaswamy  using id singanallur ramaswamy </span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br /><br />Hi all,<br /> <br />I am truly amazed by Mr Sandeep's posting. Is it true that even in South India the South Indian history is dismissed in just two pages. <br /> <br />I thought it's the situation only in north, west and east of the country. Why didn't anyone, from the south who is an academic/scholar in Indian history, try and correct this inequality or even injustice? As far as I am concerned I have read mostly about Indus valley civilisation, Alexander the Great's forays, Gupta and Maurya periods, Mughal period including Shivaji, the British period and the fight for independence. The most detailed study concerning SI kings was about the Vijayanagar empire in the 15th century AD. <br /> <br />The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and as far as I can rememberthere was next to nothing about the Cholas, let alone Raja Raja and Rajendra! That's the reason I was quite suprised to learn through this forum thatRajendra and Mohd of Gazni were contemporaries! And their paths could havecrossed had Rajendra shifted his attention westwards from the Gangetic plains instead of going straight on the East coast.<br /> <br />And I also never knew from the history lessons in school that he had defeated the Palas of Bengal. For that matter I have hardly learned anything in detail about the kingdoms of Bengal, Orissa, Karnataka or even Gujarat except that Gazni had plundered Somnath with repeated raids. Maharashtra escapedonly because it produced a warrior like Shivaji and the long line of the Peshwas. I had not learned of even the kings who<br />had built the magnificent temples in Kajuraho.<br /> <br />And strangely I never learned in school that Malik Kafur had come deep downinto South and attacked Madurai. Why, I did not know the name of Kafur till much later in life. <br /> <br />Perhaps had I taken history in college I might have studied these in some more detail, but school is the place where the entire Indian history, and not only of Bihar, UP, Delhi and Punjab, should be taught. No wonder the northerners know so little about SI languages and culture! What a shame!<br /> <br />What about the Dravidian parties who shout from the roof-tops about their love for Tamil and Tamil culture? They have done precious little to correct this serious anamoly. <br /> <br />In fact only through <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> did I learn a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> about the later Chola history andthrough <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> some part of Pallava period. We need to salute Kalki for the yeoman service he has done to open the eyes of at least some readers of historical romances (dismissed as escapist fare by some people) about the achievements of some Tamil kings! <br /> <br />Ramaswamy<br /><br /><br />To: ponniyinselvan@...:preciousfeeling@...: Wed,22 Aug 2007 07:10:41 -0700Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Criticisms on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you.I feel that it is absolutely essential to have the works of all similar authors of Tamil historical fiction to be translated to English. This is crucial to show the world, what we can call, our treasures and our unique history. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and Cilapathikaram are excellent translations. These translators should be commended a lot for their efforts and hopefully this should inspire them to translate more works. Parthiban Kanavu has a good translation as well. Can anyone tell me of available translations of all other works of Tamil Historical fiction.Sivapathasekaran  wrote: <br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, precious feeling  wrote:Welcome Mr. Sandeep.Nice posting. Awaiting more.regards / sps==============  Hi    Although I have been lurkinghere for a while, I havent participated directly in the discussions here. Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and hopefully time permitting,I look forward to regular contributions.    First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was introduced to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my 8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be theworks of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> school and there would not havebeen more than a page or 2 about the South Indian Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka whoruled most of India did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This continues to this date so much so that a society is completely corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and dignity.    More later  Sandeep  "Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote: to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the greatest king in india was Asoka, the   greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his greatest  contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism was from   distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks wearning face   masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of sravanabelagola,   srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten years ago i would   look forward to the luxsoaps n body spray bought by visitors from   there)    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> opened my eyes to the greatness that has been forgotten ( or   bulldozed) by north indian versions of indian history compulsorily   infused into our school history..to dwell deeper and realise the   real greatness - lets call it true fame..meikirti. before that south   indian kings were shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose   costumes, buxom queens ...- singing songs around flowerbeds in the   nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in   one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja thi   raja, raja marthanda...    to look at tanjore big temple, mahabalipuram in new light - not just   taking an occasional visitor on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all   the white skins there ` appreciating the stone work"...now a days   its more a spiritual feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue.   each one has a story to tell.    when you read of the conquestsof these kings 1000 years ago and   finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able to   administer their vast country, to be just,to be loved by their   subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the seas...i   can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam and   payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distantlanka,   malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world the   greatness of the tamilnadu.    i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be   more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational   material than just a passing mention. i would love my son ( he is   just learning to read and write) to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and understand the  greatness of the land he hails from.    vj    --- In <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R"    wrote:       The important question that is being raised again is whether     literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here.     There are those who think literature should serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare whichhelps   to     refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known.     When I read 'Crime and Punishment' Iwas able to connect directly     with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>   inside     having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable,     there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.     This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The     entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short   story.    Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha     wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the     workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-    climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine   (who     swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the     hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a   saivite/vaishnavite)     and some inscription as base. Mixthese in different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in thehistory novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called.     The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran.     Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu     Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc.   Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga     boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactlythe     same reason.

And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good   novels         depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the     great         novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing   him         actually shows ignorance.                 Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If     you         cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai'     or 'Moga         mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway   depletes       the         place of that novel in contemperoryliterature.                 By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>   but       has         read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to     read         even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not       make         anything great or add any literary value.                 Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not   hold         good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our         assembly and parliament to see what we get.                Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what        literature is, I would think any good literature to record   life     as         it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading.     Ofcourse,         this is one person's view. What say you?                The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value   of         <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?                Do answer the question without going into rage against       Asokamithran,         Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.                Muthu Prakash R                --- Inponniyinselvan@...m, Udanx  wrote:                   I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai.

This        book            takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of    Kanaiyazhi         (1964-            74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.            There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki,   Sandilyan's       style            of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon.       Apparently            this is his only story. The story is twoepisodes (Episode     300         and            301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a     piece       of            the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the            episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking       about         the           literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.            Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured     by       the            romanticness ofit, I actually moved away from it during   my         college            days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).            For what reasons? because itis a romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one thingin your soul. Ofcourse, there are     those         of us            who got interested in their history but I think the     percentage       is           much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point   in           looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont     read,            say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to   do      that         I            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>   for       the            sheer joy or it and if I want to readto improve upon the       soul, I            will be reading a 'Moga mull'or a 'Nizhal mutram'.            One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of            thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the     mocking         words            by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the       novel 'Sivagami            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing       remark            criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the         escapism in            life.                       The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply     call         this            between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I   chose     to         call            it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group. My question is this                       What, if any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?

Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below <br />post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and <br />hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular contributions.  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was introduced <br />to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik</div></blockquote>Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my <br />8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to <br />Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be <br />the works of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> school and there <br />would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian <br />Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian <br />kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present <br />day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame <br />ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India <br />did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be <br />dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This <br />continues to this date so much so that a society is completely <br />corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation <br />states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and <br />structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our <br />ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and <br />dignity.    More later  Sandeep  "Vijay Kumar .S"  <br />wrote: to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the greatest king in india was <br />Asoka, the   greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his <br />greatest   contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism <br />was from   distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks <br />wearning face   masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of <br />sravanabelagola,   srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten <br />years ago i would   look forward to the lux soaps n body spray <br />bought by visitors from   there)    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> opened my eyes to the <br />greatness that has been forgotten ( or   bulldozed) by north indian <br />versions of indian history compulsorily   infused into our school <br />history..to dwell deeper and realise the   real greatness - lets <br />call it true fame..meikirti. before that south   indian kings were <br />shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose   costumes, buxom <br />queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the   <br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>one hand &#40; enjoyed it though&#41; - some poor kavalali shouting raja <br />thi   raja, raja marthanda...    to look at tanjore big temple,</div></blockquote>mahabalipuram in new light - not just   taking an occasional visitor <br />on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all   the white skins there ` <br />appreciating the stone work"...now a days   its more a spiritual <br />feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue.   each one has a <br />story to tell.    when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 <br />years ago and   finding proofs of their conquests in far away <br />lands....to be able to   administer their vast country, to be just, <br />to be loved by their   subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage <br />war across the seas...i   can roll back my eyes and hear the battle <br />cries of chozam chozam and   payum vengai kodi bearing troops <br />capturing forts in distant lanka,   malaysia and indonesia - <br />victoriously proclaiming to the world the   greatness of the <br />tamilnadu.    i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya <br />history to be   more correctly portrayed in our primary and <br />secondary educational   material than just a passing mention. i <br />would love my son ( he is   just learning to read and write) to read <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and understand the   greatness of the land he hails from.    vj  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R"   <br /> wrote:       The important question that is being raised</div></blockquote>again is whether     literature should serve any purpose. The school <br />is divided here.     There are those who think literature should <br />serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do <br />nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki's characterizations and <br />narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is <br />escapist fare which helps   to     refocus your thoughts to a <br />fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. I <br />am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of Monte <br />Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They succeed <br />in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little <br />relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about Kalki's <br />skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and his <br />social commitment is well-known.     When I read 'Crime and <br />Punishment' I was able to connect directly     with the trails of <br />the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived in <br />a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your <br />heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>   inside     <br />having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable,     <br />there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.     <br />This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The     <br />entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short   <br />story.     Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha     <br />wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the     <br />workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-    <br />climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine   <br />(who     swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for <br />the     hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a   <br />saivite/vaishnavite)     and some inscription as base. Mix these in <br />different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in the <br />history novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these <br />novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the 'classics' as <br />they are derisively called.     The 'classics' are difficult because <br />they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take <br />Asokamithran.     Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu     <br />Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc.   <br />Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there <br />is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I <br />consider 'Thyaga     boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly the     same reason.

By <br />that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>   but       <br />has         read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it <br />difficult to     read         even the title page).

For what reasons? because it is a <br />romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one <br />thing in your soul.

Its probably because I have a lot to say as well.

I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my<br />8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to<br />Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be<br />the works of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> school and there<br />would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian<br />Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian<br />kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present<br />day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame<br />ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India<br />did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be<br />dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This<br />continues to this date so much so that a society is completely<br />corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation<br />states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and<br />structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our<br />ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and<br />dignity.

The school<br />is divided here.     There are those who think literature should<br />serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do<br />nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki's characterizations and<br />narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is<br />escapist fare which helps   to     refocus your thoughts to a<br />fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. I<br />am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of Monte<br />Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They succeed<br />in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little<br />relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about Kalki's<br />skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and his<br />social commitment is well-known.     When I read 'Crime and<br />Punishment' I was able to connect directly     with the trails of<br />the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived in<br />a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your<br />heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>   inside    <br />having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable,    <br />there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.    <br />This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The    <br />entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short  <br />story.     Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha    <br />wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the    <br />workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-   <br />climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine  <br />(who     swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for<br />the     hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a  <br />saivite/vaishnavite)     and some inscription as base. Mix these in<br />different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in the<br />history novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these<br />novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the 'classics' as<br />they are derisively called.     The 'classics' are difficult because<br />they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take<br />Asokamithran.     Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu    <br />Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc.  <br />Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there<br />is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary<br />worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I<br />consider 'Thyaga     boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly the     same reason.

Not<br />knowing him is one thing, abusing   him         actually shows<br />ignorance.                 Again, I dont want this to degenerate<br />into a personal duel. If     you         cannot read past two pages<br />of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai'     or 'Moga         mull', that is<br />understandable but that does not anyway   depletes       the        <br />place of that novel in contemperory literature.                 By<br />that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>   but      <br />has         read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it<br />difficult to     read         even the title page). Thus, 'easier to<br />read' criteria does not       make         anything great or add any<br />literary value.                 Also the argument that it is likes<br />by more people does not   hold         good.

Ofcourse,         this<br />is one person's view. What say you?

For what reasons? because it is a<br />romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one<br />thing in your soul.

I dont     read,            say, 'Three<br />musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to   do       that        <br />I            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo.

Is it true that even <br />in <br />  South India the South Indian history is dismissed in just two <br />pages. <br />    <br />    I thought it&#39;s the situation only in north, west and east of the <br />  country. Why didn&#39;t anyone, from the south who is an <br />  academic/scholar in Indian history, try and correct this <br />inequality <br />  or even injustice? As far as I am concerned I have read mostly <br />about <br />  Indus valley civilisation, Alexander the Great&#39;s forays, Gupta and <br />  Maurya periods, Mughal period including Shivaji, the British <br />period <br />  and the fight for independence. The most detailed study concerning <br />  SI kings was about the Vijayanagar empire in the 15th century AD. <br />    <br />    The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and as far as I <br />can <br />  remember there was next to nothing about the Cholas, let alone <br />Raja <br />  Raja and Rajendra! That&#39;s the reason I was quite suprised to learn <br />  through this forum that Rajendra and Mohd of Gazni were <br />  contemporaries! And their paths could have crossed had Rajendra <br />  shifted his attention westwards from the Gangetic plains instead <br />of <br />  going straight on the East coast.<br />    <br />    And I also never knew from the history lessons in school that he <br />  had defeated the Palas of Bengal. For that matter I have hardly <br />  learned anything in detail about the kingdoms of Bengal, Orissa, <br />  Karnataka or even Gujarat except that Gazni had plundered Somnath <br />  with repeated raids. Maharashtra escaped only because it produced <br />a <br />  warrior like Shivaji and the long line of the Peshwas. I had not <br />  learned of even the kings who<br />    had built the magnificent temples in Kajuraho.<br />    <br />    And strangely I never learned in school that Malik Kafur had <br />come <br />  deep down into South and attacked Madurai. Why, I did not know the <br />  name of Kafur till much later in life. <br />    <br />    Perhaps had I taken history in college I might have studied <br />these <br />  in some more detail, but school is the place where the entire <br />Indian <br />  history, and not only of Bihar, UP, Delhi and Punjab, should be <br />  taught. No wonder the northerners know so little about SI <br />languages <br />  and culture! What a shame!<br />    <br />    What about the Dravidian parties who shout from the roof-tops <br />  about their love for Tamil and Tamil culture? They have done <br />  precious little to correct this serious anamoly. <br />    <br />    In fact only through <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> did I learn a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> about the later Chola <br />  history and through <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> some part of Pallava period.

Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below <br />  post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and <br />  hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular <br />contributions.  <br />    First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was <br />introduced <br />  to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik <br />  Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say <br />my <br />  8th standard till now &#40;Im 40!&#41;. I am generally attracted to <br />  Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will <br />be <br />  the works of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> school and there <br />  would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian <br />  Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian <br />  kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in <br />present <br />  day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame <br />  ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of <br />India <br />  did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us <br />be <br />  dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. <br />This <br />  continues to this date so much so that a society is completely <br />  corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation <br />  states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and <br />  structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our <br />  ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and <br />  dignity.

The <br />school <br />  is divided here.     There are those who think literature should <br />  serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do <br />  nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations <br />and <br />  narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is <br />  escapist fare which helps   to     refocus your thoughts to a <br />  fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. <br />I <br />  am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of <br />Monte <br />  Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They <br />succeed <br />  in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little <br />  relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about <br />Kalki&#39;s <br />  skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and <br />his <br />  social commitment is well-known.     When I read &#39;Crime and <br />  Punishment&#39; I was able to connect directly     with the trails of <br />  the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived <br />in <br />  a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your <br />  heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>   inside     <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable,   <br />  <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.     <br />  This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The   <br />  <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short   <br />  story.     Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha   <br />  <br />  wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on the   <br />  <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-  <br />  <br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine   <br />  &#40;who     swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls <br />for <br />  the     hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a   <br />  saivite/vaishnavite&#41;     and some inscription as base. Mix these <br />in <br />  different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in the <br />  history novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these <br />  novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as <br />  they are derisively called.     The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult <br />because <br />  they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take <br />  Asokamithran.     Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu     <br />  Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc.   <br />  Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While <br />there <br />  is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />  worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I <br />  consider &#39;Thyaga     boomi&#39; and &#39;Alai Osai&#39; on a higher plane than <br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly the     same reason.

And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real <br />  good   novels         depicting life as it was lived and is <br />  considered one of the     great         novelists of our time. Not <br />  knowing him is one thing, abusing   him         actually shows <br />  ignorance.                 Again, I dont want this to degenerate <br />  into a personal duel.

By <br />  that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>   but     <br />  <br />  has         read &#39;Paradise lost&#39; completely &#40;which I find it <br />  difficult to     read         even the title page&#41;.

Also the argument that it is likes <br />  by more people does not   hold         good.

There <br />is <br />  a very funny, satirical take on Kalki,   Sandilyan&#39;s       style  <br />  <br />          of writing called &#39;Mazha naatu magudam&#39; by Nagupoleon.     <br />  <br />  Apparently            this is his only story. The story is two <br />  episodes &#40;Episode     300         and            301&#41; of a long <br />  running historical ovel in a weekly and a     piece       of      <br />  <br />      the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the    <br />  <br />        episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking   <br />  <br />    about         the            literary criticisms levelled at <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.  <br />            Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was <br />enamoured <br />      by       the            romanticness of it, I actually moved <br />  away from it during   my         college            days&#40;I studied <br />  in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.            For what reasons? because it is a <br />  romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one <br />  thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are     those         of us    <br />  <br />        who got interested in their history but I think the     <br />  percentage       is            much lower . But being a romantic <br />  novel, there is no point   in            looking for things to <br />  improve upon the soul also. I dont     read,            <br />say, &#39;Three <br />  musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to   do       that       <br />  <br />  I            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>   for       the            sheer joy or it and if I want to <br />read <br />  to improve upon the       soul, I            will be reading <br />a &#39;Moga <br />  mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.            One book I read page by <br />page <br />  for about a month with lots of            thinking is &#39;JJ sila <br />  kurippugal&#39; I still remember the     mocking         words        <br />  <br />    by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the       <br />  novel &#39;Sivagami            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri <br />  vittala?&#39; This scathing       remark            criticizes <br />  romanicism at its extreme and questioning the         escapism in  <br />  <br />          life.

Is it<br />  true that even in<br />  South India the South Indian history is dismissed in<br />  just two pages.<br />   <br />    I thought it&#39;s the situation only in north, west<br />  and east of the<br />  country. Why didn&#39;t anyone, from the south who is an<br /> <br />  academic/scholar in Indian history, try and correct<br />  this inequality<br />  or even injustice? As far as I am concerned I have<br />  read mostly about<br />  Indus valley civilisation, Alexander the Great&#39;s<br />  forays, Gupta and<br />  Maurya periods, Mughal period including Shivaji, the<br />  British period<br />  and the fight for independence. The most detailed<br />  study concerning<br />  SI kings was about the Vijayanagar empire in the<br />  15th century AD.<br />   <br />    The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and<br />  as far as I can<br />  remember there was next to nothing about the Cholas,<br />  let alone Raja<br />  Raja and Rajendra! That&#39;s the reason I was quite<br />  suprised to learn<br />  through this forum that Rajendra and Mohd of Gazni<br />  were<br />  contemporaries! And their paths could have crossed<br />  had Rajendra<br />  shifted his attention westwards from the Gangetic<br />  plains instead of<br />  going straight on the East coast.<br />   <br />    And I also never knew from the history lessons in<br />  school that he<br />  had defeated the Palas of Bengal. For that matter I<br />  have hardly<br />  learned anything in detail about the kingdoms of<br />  Bengal, Orissa,<br />  Karnataka or even Gujarat except that Gazni had<br />  plundered Somnath<br />  with repeated raids. Maharashtra escaped only<br />  because it produced a<br />  warrior like Shivaji and the long line of the<br />  Peshwas. I had not<br />  learned of even the kings who<br />    had built the magnificent temples in Kajuraho.<br />   <br />    And strangely I never learned in school that Malik<br />  Kafur had come<br />  deep down into South and attacked Madurai. Why, I<br />  did not know the<br />  name of Kafur till much later in life.<br />   <br />    Perhaps had I taken history in college I might<br />  have studied these<br />  in some more detail, but school is the place where<br />  the entire Indian<br />  history, and not only of Bihar, UP, Delhi and<br />  Punjab, should be<br />  taught. No wonder the northerners know so little<br />  about SI languages<br />  and culture! What a shame!<br />   <br />    What about the Dravidian parties who shout from<br />  the roof-tops<br />  about their love for Tamil and Tamil culture? They<br />  have done<br />  precious little to correct this serious anamoly.<br />   <br />    In fact only through <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> did I learn a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> about<br />  the later Chola<br />  history and through <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> some part of Pallava period.<br />  We need to<br />  salute Kalki for the yeoman service he has done to<br />  open the eyes of<br />  at least some readers of historical romances<br />  &#40;dismissed as escapist<br />  fare by some people&#41; about the achievements of some<br />  Tamil kings!<br />   <br />    Ramaswamy<br />   <br />   <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@...: preciousfeeling@...: Wed,<br />  22 Aug 2007<br />  07:10:41 -0700Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re:<br />  Criticisms on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Thank you.I feel that it is absolutely essential<br />  to have the works<br />  of all similar authors of Tamil historical fiction<br />  to be translated<br />  to English. This is crucial to show the world, what<br />  we can call, our<br />  treasures and our unique history. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and<br />  Cilapathikaram are<br />  excellent translations. These translators should be<br />  commended a lot<br />  for their efforts and hopefully this should inspire<br />  them to<br />  translate more works. Parthiban Kanavu has a good<br />  translation as<br />  well.

			<div class="content">The most important works in this are - collection of the material, <br />preserving them as such and archieving via some medium, translating <br />them and converting them to current text. The task is enormous and a <br />lot of people /univ/institutions have tried/are trying this, they <br />have the infrastructure to do the tasks exceptfor the first. this is <br />where groups like us can contribute.<br /><br />to collect /spread awareness - as of now the bulk of the palm leaf <br />scripts are stuck in govt archives ( inside india), art collectors <br />and museums ( in europe), private collections ( both in india and <br />abroad)- <br />the problems is that some of the collectors do not know what they <br />are holding. meaning they know that its an old manuscript, but do <br />not have any way of knowing what they hold<br /><br />WE CAN COME UP WITH A SAMPLE OF THE WRITINGS - PALM LEAF, STONE <br />INSCRIPTIONS - TO SHOW THE VARIOUS SCRIPTS - LIKE WHAT VARALAARU HAS <br />(7th C pallava script etc), / PUT IT INTO A PDF FILE AND HOST IT ON <br />THE NET. WITH A REQUEST TO ANYONE WHO HAS SIMILAR SCRIPT TO CTC or <br />to asssist in atleast co ordinating in obtaining a copy.<br /><br />We also need to tie up with a institute/organisation who can then <br />take over the rest of the work. Publishing them is the last task and <br />am sure once the other tasks are done, getting these works of great <br />literary value to be published cab ne easily acomplished.<br /><br />rgds<br />vj<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>With Vijay also sharing this interest, we can form a core-<br />committee <br />  and explore more possibilities.<br />  <br />  lv. sps</div></blockquote></div>
