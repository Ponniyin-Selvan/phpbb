			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by mathava ramanan  using id smaramanan</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear All,<br />First of all I need to clarify something what<br />I mentioned as "Kumbalodu Kovindaaa",because its off<br />the track atleast by few members as I see in their<br />mails.<br />I read from the members,some concrete achievements<br />like Farmer's poverty reduction,Mudhal<br />Yathirai,Magazine,TV entry,Kovil thiruppani just to<br />name a few.<br />I felt really guilty for not doing anything concrete<br />except the mails.Since my mails were not producing<br />anything in that line as "concrete",I felt of calling<br />my mails as "Kumbaloda Govindaa" among more than 230s<br />here and 1000 messages here...<br /><br />I am not sure why few members misunderstood or perhaps<br />if many of you thought that way,I sincerely apologise<br />for my "srcibblings" which was not well written for<br />those who understood that way,which was definitely not<br />my way of putting it.And moreover I will not be<br />sending those mails if I thought that way.<br /><br />But Thanks for the message anyway on Ms and Vs of the<br />group.B4 looking that,<br /><br />Apart from parents, the tamil teachers u get is also<br />important. I would say my interest in tamil developed<br />all because of excellent teachers i had in schools.<br />I think the govt also played a parting spoiling the<br />link.Aa a whole everthing right from govt to society<br />must change to stop this rot.<br /><br />Well said,In my opinion,The state has the major role<br />in it more than anyone.<br /><br />Personally speaking, it was due to my own interest<br />that I started reading good Tamil books apart from my<br />school books(of course, I was looked down upon for<br />that. My friends thought that I was an old fashioned<br />girl).<br /><br />This is 200% true.<br />This is what I called as "Power of Tamil keeps Tamil".<br />Iron pieces being attracted by magnet something like<br />this....<br /><br />As for the Vs and Ms,even if I am not good contributor<br />to any concrete works,I have few concerns,please note<br />this is not any criticism,its only concerns.<br /><br /><br />* To enjoy, debade and analyze the characters and<br />events of Ponniyin<br />Selvan<br />and other historic novels of Amarar Kalki.<br /><br />I would much appreciate to relate it to the present<br />time,rather than only to think in terms of the Cholas<br />times or in the words of A.Kalki.Why not bring those<br />to the present day characters,events?And see what has<br />changed or evolved or whatever one may wants to call<br />it in time-space movements.Most importanly what can we<br />"LEARN" out of it.And how to bring Tamil to be a more<br />respectable language among "Tanglish".<br /><br />But here I am not defintely referring to "meesais" and<br />"the number of wives".I mean on Tamil developments.<br /><br /><br />* To know and share vital information on Tamil and<br />Indian history -<br />particularly those around cholas.<br /><br />"Vital Informations" - very catchy word.I wonder on<br />these vital informations particularly on Cholas???????<br />This raises further question(courtesy:Einstein )<br />What is vital information?What is its use to the Tamil<br />man on the road?or even to the members?From: whose<br />point of view is it vital?In what way it'll help Tamil<br />or its growth or development from what we call as<br />"Tanglish" to Tamil.<br /><br /><br />* To promote and share this interest in public; to<br />raise the general<br />awareness about our culture, Temples and heritage.<br /><br /><br />Excellent.Infact some members showed here the great<br />enthusiasm,which later for some reason or other didn't<br />come up,Or did I miss it....<br /><br /><br />My sincere concerns were/are/will be for the Tamil<br />developments.Hope my concerns are put in the group<br />which is good to receive suggestions and comments.<br /><br />Have a wonderful time.<br /><br />Best Wishes for Ms and Vs,<br />Mathav<br /><br /><br />=====<br /><img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Nothing will benefit human health or increase the chances for survival of life on earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet-A.Einstein.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/">http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do you Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear mathav,<br /><br />I would like to clarify a few things.<br /><br />Before asking "What way this would help?", "will it be of<br />kaal-kaasu prayOjanam?", I would like to clarify we are not a<br />company or a business organisation. We are a group of people who<br />share similar interests. In a Sachin Tendulkar fan Vlub, people<br />will still talk abt. his century at Perth. What way that is going<br />to help Indian Cricket? What way is it going to help the members<br />of the group?<br /><br />We have clearly stated in the group's title that we are all awed<br />by this Magnum-Opus and the characters of chozha history have<br />become part and parcel of our life. Each and every single minute<br />detail abt. the chozha history gives us immense pleasure.<br /><br />You are coming to a Chinese restaurent and asking "why do yous<br />erve only chinese food here? why not be a 'worl restaurant' and<br />serve pastas and pizzas and idlisi and chappathis". This group has<br />not turned a blind ewye on other histories. but our primary<br />concern is on chozhas. We believe in going in step by step. there<br />is still so much discuss only on chozha heritage. if there is<br />nothing left to talk abt. them, we will move on and discuss other<br />histories and periods.<br /><br />We sincerely appreciate your concerns on Thamizh heritage. But, I<br />honestly feel that this group members know abt. what you are<br />talking only too well. By making an appeal ever other day to save<br />the thamizh you aren't saying anything new. while you objective<br />analysis on 'what is holding thamizh from glory' is thought<br />provoking, rest of your emotional appeals aren't too well with<br />group. In your words, 'they aren't of much use in preserving<br />thamizh', as we know all that only too well.<br /><br />Hope you take this mail in right spirit and continue contributing<br />to this group.<br /><br />regards,<br />Ram<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ramachandran Mahadevan,<br />Research Assistant,<br />Washington State University,<br />H-113,1920NE Terre View Dr,<br />Pullman,WA,99163<br />Phone-509-332-5832,<br />Lab:509-335-5977,<br />509-335-2436</div>

Inquisitiveness should be tempered by humility<br />and respectful regard for the teacher. It must not<br />degenerate into impudence. The latter is the enemy of<br />the receptivity of mind.

History is important and<br />one needs to "learn" out of it,NOT<br />ENJOY.Romance,perhaps but not history.Because most of<br />the time history has been very very very<br />painful.Ofcourse there are people who like to say<br />"bombay" or "iruvar" being an enjoyable films.But<br />certainly I am not that kind.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>You are coming to a Chinese restaurent and asking<br />  "why do yous<br />  erve only chinese food here?</div></blockquote>Yes,but if people coming to the Chinese restaurant<br />wants to share "vital informations" of Chinese<br />Myinggggggg Dynasty, I need to ask, do you know the<br />"vital informations" of the "Englishhhh" rule which is<br />less than 1000 years...Have we "learnt enough" from<br />the recent history?<br /><br />So it depends on "what happens" and what one sees<br />inside the Chinese Restaurant to ask for Chappathis<br />and Idleesss....<br /><br />And moreover,I see people working inside the Chinese<br />restaurant non-chinese,and an atmosphere of<br />non-chineese,in your language for eg. some one who can<br />cook Idlees and Chappatheesss are more in number even<br />if the restaurant has Chinese Restaurant as its<br />namesake.So it really shoudn't "surprise" if a visitor<br />asks for thatn chappathis and pizza as there are lots<br />of non chinese there...<br /><br /><br />By making an appeal ever<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>other day to save<br />  the thamizh you aren&#39;t saying anything new.</div></blockquote>So what kind of "vital informations" are you expecting<br />from each and every mails?Please let me know and if I<br />know that/those "vital information" I would think of<br />it.<br />Yes,may be I am "repeating" Tamil to be<br />developed,grown,and not make it as Tanglish.Afterall<br />when people talks of "whose love is greatest",I feel<br />happy to repeat save Tamil...<br />Afterall if Mahatma or Mahakavi or President's opinon<br />cann't bring down the fever,What should make my appeal<br />"anything" to you?Because I am only reminding what<br />they and many other great souls have "already" said<br />long long long time ago....<br />"I find daily proof of the increasing & continuing<br />wrong being done to the millions by our false<br />de-Indianizing education."<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br />Members here wonder where is the link broken....<br />Link is above...And what have we done for it?Only a<br />couple of concerns....But ofcourse I am happy atleast<br />they came up.<br />We want to praise and call someone who ruled on<br />Indians as "LORD Curzonnnnn" among the many other<br />"LORDS"....Not to mention the if there is any pride in<br />calling someone with "GENERAL" for the Jalian<br />Wallabagh?<br />How can the society produce children who would love<br />the local tradition,culture,language,etc....when they<br />read such people with such "Tittles"<br />Whats surprising to see them naturally attracted to<br />these "Lords" and "Generals"????<br /><br /><br />while<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>you objective<br />  analysis on &#39;what is holding thamizh from glory&#39; is<br />  thought<br />  provoking,</div></blockquote>Thanks for that,but,this doesn't make one happy....Had<br />it been so called "Thought provoking",U would have<br />sent numerous mails on "thought provoking" analysis<br />and make everyone here as well and perhaps comes out<br />with a different perspective as some members did<br />that...<br /><br />rest of your emotional appeals aren't too<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>well with<br />  group. In your words, &#39;they aren&#39;t of much use in<br />  preserving<br />  thamizh&#39;, as we know all that only too well.</div></blockquote>But it did "rise up" now when the thought provoking<br />analysis didn't do to send a mail????Is it???<br />Strange,but true "thought provoking" analysis doesn't<br />do what simple words can do.<br />Also I wish I could add Dr.Mathav <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> that makes<br />miracles happen....atleast sometimes...when I have a<br />"white coat".<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hope you take this mail in right spirit and continue<br />  contributing<br />  to this group.</div></blockquote>In Mahatma's beginning note,there is humility and<br />respect, I am not sure if its reflected in my mail.But<br />sincerely I wish to express it in this group..<br />For sure I am sincerely feeling this group is really<br />great even if we disagree on certain issues.Afterall<br />thats the way to "learn".<br />Whats there if one accepts the other,without "any"<br />questioning????Or without any "answering".<br />Hope you have the spirit.I really meant to discuss<br />more,but its upto the members interest.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />Mathav<br /><br />=====<br /><img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Nothing will benefit human health or increase the chances for survival of life on earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet-A.Einstein.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/">http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do you Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Mathav,All,<br /><br />First of all, I would like to congratulate all the members of<br />this group. The group is doing a great job. Sticking to the main<br />objectives of the group is a great thing initself, in this<br />distractive world,let alone other great efforts like bringing in<br />experts, organising excursions into Chola Kingdom w.r.t. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, helping<br />organisations that are helping tamil and history in whatever humble<br />way we could,news of how people help history/culture like temples and<br />ofcourse the experts whose views are as great and real as ever.<br /><br />While we understand the importance and urgency of "Keeping<br />Tamil Alive", it might not be fair to force stop people from taking<br />pleasure. We sure can talk about "Improving tamil" anywhere, but not<br />about the history/fiction of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br /><br />It gives an immense pleasure to talk about the people and places<br />of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. I am sure you would have got the same pleasure and the<br />feeling like time travelling 1000 years back into the chola kingdom<br />and the "Kathai Nadantha Kaalam", when you had read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. Now<br />discussing the time,place and people of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> here gives us a similar<br />feeling. There is nothing trivial in this. Everything is part of the<br />time-travelling. It is a feeling which nothing else can give. It is a<br />world in itself. We might be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> selfish here.<br /><br />I only appeal to you that you can't deny us this pleasure. Nor can<br />you question this. It,just, might not be fair.<br /><br />Having said that, you may send the off-topic "Long live Tamil"<br />mails. They are definitely helpful for people who don't have that<br />much awareness on why Tamil is great and why it is important to keep<br />it alive. May be one day we shall all take a break and discuss how to<br />effectively contribute towards the same.<br />But I reckon you are going a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> too fast. The risk is you might<br />breakdown. Try to slow down a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> and enjoy the journey , while<br />keeping the same fervour alive for a long time.<br /><br />The above two paragraphs might sound like advice, but sorry, I<br />don't like talking in passive voice. I have tried the same(above<br />paragraphs) and it is a great feeling. I enjoy it. I thought you<br />could enjoy too.<br /><br />-Mani<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, mathava ramanan<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All,<br />  First of all I need to clarify something what<br />  I mentioned as "Kumbalodu Kovindaaa",because its off<br />  the track atleast by few members as I see in their<br />  mails.<br />  I read from the members,some concrete achievements<br />  like Farmer&#39;s poverty reduction,Mudhal<br />  Yathirai,Magazine,TV entry,Kovil thiruppani just to<br />  name a few.<br />  I felt really guilty for not doing anything concrete<br />  except the mails.Since my mails were not producing<br />  anything in that line as "concrete",I felt of calling<br />  my mails as "Kumbaloda Govindaa" among more than 230s<br />  here and 1000 messages here...<br /> <br />  I am not sure why few members misunderstood or perhaps<br />  if many of you thought that way,I sincerely apologise<br />  for my "srcibblings" which was not well written for<br />  those who understood that way,which was definitely not<br />  my way of putting it.And moreover I will not be<br />  sending those mails if I thought that way.<br /> <br />  But Thanks for the message anyway on Ms and Vs of the<br />  group.B4 looking that,<br /> <br />  Apart from parents, the tamil teachers u get is also<br />  important. I would say my interest in tamil developed<br />  all because of excellent teachers i had in schools.<br />  I think the govt also played a parting spoiling the<br />  link.Aa a whole everthing right from govt to society<br />  must change to stop this rot.<br /> <br />  Well said,In my opinion,The state has the major role<br />  in it more than anyone.<br /> <br />  Personally speaking, it was due to my own interest<br />  that I started reading good Tamil books apart from my<br />  school books&#40;of course, I was looked down upon for<br />  that. My friends thought that I was an old fashioned<br />  girl&#41;.<br /> <br />  This is 200% true.<br />  This is what I called as "Power of Tamil keeps Tamil".<br />  Iron pieces being attracted by magnet something like<br />  this....<br /> <br />  As for the Vs and Ms,even if I am not good contributor<br />  to any concrete works,I have few concerns,please note<br />  this is not any criticism,its only concerns.<br /> <br /> <br />  * To enjoy, debade and analyze the characters and<br />  events of Ponniyin<br />  Selvan<br />  and other historic novels of Amarar Kalki.<br /> <br />  I would much appreciate to relate it to the present<br />  time,rather than only to think in terms of the Cholas<br />  times or in the words of A.Kalki.Why not bring those<br />  to the present day characters,events?And see what has<br />  changed or evolved or whatever one may wants to call<br />  it in time-space movements.Most importanly what can we<br />  "LEARN" out of it.And how to bring Tamil to be a more<br />  respectable language among "Tanglish".<br /> <br />  But here I am not defintely referring to "meesais" and<br />  "the number of wives".I mean on Tamil developments.<br /> <br /> <br />  * To know and share vital information on Tamil and<br />  Indian history -<br />  particularly those around cholas.<br /> <br />  "Vital Informations" - very catchy word.I wonder on<br />  these vital informations particularly on Cholas???????<br />  This raises further question&#40;courtesy:Einstein &#41;<br />  What is vital information?What is its use to the Tamil<br />  man on the road?or even to the members?From: whose<br />  point of view is it vital?In what way it&#39;ll help Tamil<br />  or its growth or development from what we call as<br />  "Tanglish" to Tamil.<br /> <br /> <br />  * To promote and share this interest in public; to<br />  raise the general<br />  awareness about our culture, Temples and heritage.<br /> <br /> <br />  Excellent.Infact some members showed here the great<br />  enthusiasm,which later for some reason or other didn&#39;t<br />  come up,Or did I miss it....<br /> <br /> <br />  My sincere concerns were/are/will be for the Tamil<br />  developments.Hope my concerns are put in the group<br />  which is good to receive suggestions and comments.<br /> <br />  Have a wonderful time.<br /> <br />  Best Wishes for Ms and Vs,<br />  Mathav</div></blockquote></div>

Sticking<br />  to the main<br />  objectives of the group is a great thing initself,<br />  in this<br />  distractive world,let alone other great efforts like<br />  bringing in<br />  experts, organising excursions into Chola Kingdom<br />  w.r.t. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, helping<br />  organisations that are helping tamil and history in<br />  whatever humble<br />  way we could,news of how people help history/culture<br />  like temples and<br />  ofcourse the experts whose views are as great and<br />  real as ever.<br /> <br />  While we understand the importance and urgency<br />  of "Keeping<br />  Tamil Alive", it might not be fair to force stop<br />  people from taking<br />  pleasure. We sure can talk about "Improving tamil"<br />  anywhere, but not<br />  about the history/fiction of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br /> <br />  It gives an immense pleasure to talk about the<br />  people and places<br />  of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. I am sure you would have got the same<br />  pleasure and the<br />  feeling like time travelling 1000 years back into<br />  the chola kingdom<br />  and the "Kathai Nadantha Kaalam", when you had read<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. Now<br />  discussing the time,place and people of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> here<br />  gives us a similar<br />  feeling. There is nothing trivial in this.<br />  Everything is part of the<br />  time-travelling. It is a feeling which nothing else<br />  can give. It is a<br />  world in itself. We might be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> selfish here.<br /> <br />  I only appeal to you that you can&#39;t deny us this<br />  pleasure. Nor can<br />  you question this. It,just, might not be fair.<br /> <br />  Having said that, you may send the off-topic<br />  "Long live Tamil"<br />  mails. They are definitely helpful for people who<br />  don&#39;t have that<br />  much awareness on why Tamil is great and why it is<br />  important to keep<br />  it alive. May be one day we shall all take a break<br />  and discuss how to<br />  effectively contribute towards the same.<br />  But I reckon you are going a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> too fast. The<br />  risk is you might<br />  breakdown. Try to slow down a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> and enjoy the<br />  journey , while<br />  keeping the same fervour alive for a long time.<br /> <br />  The above two paragraphs might sound like<br />  advice, but sorry, I<br />  don&#39;t like talking in passive voice. I have tried<br />  the same&#40;above<br />  paragraphs&#41; and it is a great feeling. I enjoy it. I<br />  thought you<br />  could enjoy too.<br /> <br />  -Mani<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, mathava<br />  ramanan<br />   wrote:<br />    Dear All,<br />    First of all I need to clarify something<br />  what<br />    I mentioned as "Kumbalodu Kovindaaa",because its<br />  off<br />    the track atleast by few members as I see in their<br />    mails.<br />    I read from the members,some concrete achievements<br />    like Farmer&#39;s poverty reduction,Mudhal<br />    Yathirai,Magazine,TV entry,Kovil thiruppani just<br />  to<br />    name a few.<br />    I felt really guilty for not doing anything<br />  concrete<br />    except the mails.Since my mails were not producing<br />    anything in that line as "concrete",I felt of<br />  calling<br />    my mails as "Kumbaloda Govindaa" among more than<br />  230s<br />    here and 1000 messages here...<br />   <br />    I am not sure why few members misunderstood or<br />  perhaps<br />    if many of you thought that way,I sincerely<br />  apologise<br />    for my "srcibblings" which was not well written<br />  for<br />    those who understood that way,which was definitely<br />  not<br />    my way of putting it.And moreover I will not be<br />    sending those mails if I thought that way.<br />   <br />    But Thanks for the message anyway on Ms and Vs of<br />  the<br />    group.B4 looking that,<br />   <br />    Apart from parents, the tamil teachers u get is<br />  also<br />    important. I would say my interest in tamil<br />  developed<br />    all because of excellent teachers i had in<br />  schools.<br />    I think the govt also played a parting spoiling<br />  the<br />    link.Aa a whole everthing right from govt to<br />  society<br />    must change to stop this rot.<br />   <br />    Well said,In my opinion,The state has the major<br />  role<br />    in it more than anyone.<br />   <br />    Personally speaking, it was due to my own interest<br />    that I started reading good Tamil books apart from<br />  my<br />    school books&#40;of course, I was looked down upon for<br />    that. My friends thought that I was an old<br />  fashioned<br />    girl&#41;.<br />   <br />    This is 200% true.<br />    This is what I called as "Power of Tamil keeps<br />  Tamil".<br />    Iron pieces being attracted by magnet something<br />  like<br />    this....<br />   <br />    As for the Vs and Ms,even if I am not good<br />  contributor<br />    to any concrete works,I have few concerns,please<br />  note<br />    this is not any criticism,its only concerns.<br />   <br />   <br />    * To enjoy, debade and analyze the characters and<br />    events of Ponniyin<br />    Selvan<br />    and other historic novels of Amarar Kalki.<br />   <br />    I would much appreciate to relate it to the<br />  present<br />    time,rather than only to think in terms of the<br />  Cholas<br />    times or in the words of A.Kalki.Why not bring<br />  those<br />    to the present day characters,events?And see what<br />  has<br />    changed or evolved or whatever one may wants to<br />  call<br />    it in time-space movements.Most importanly what<br />  can we<br />    "LEARN" out of it.And how to bring Tamil to be a<br />  more<br />    respectable language among "Tanglish".<br />   <br />    But here I am not defintely referring to "meesais"<br />  and<br />    "the number of wives".I mean on Tamil<br />  developments.<br />   <br />   <br />    * To know and share vital information on Tamil and<br />    Indian history -<br />    particularly those around cholas.<br />   <br />    "Vital Informations" - very catchy word.I wonder<br />  on<br />    these vital informations particularly on<br />  Cholas???????<br />    This raises further question&#40;courtesy:Einstein &#41;<br />    What is vital information?What is its use to the<br />  Tamil<br />    man on the road?or even to the members?From: whose<br />    point of view is it vital?In what way it&#39;ll help<br />  Tamil<br />    or its growth or development from what we call as<br />    "Tanglish" to Tamil.<br />   <br />   <br />    * To promote and share this interest in public; to<br />    raise the general<br />    awareness about our culture, Temples and heritage.<br />   <br />   <br />    Excellent.Infact some members showed here the<br />  great<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br />=====<br /><img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Nothing will benefit human health or increase the chances for survival of life on earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet-A.Einstein.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/">http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~em0madav/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do you Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo!
