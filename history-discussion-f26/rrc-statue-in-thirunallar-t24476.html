And it is believed that one of <br />them is, that of the Chola king Raja Raja, it is food for <br />researchers as this image is so strikingly similar to the one  <br />found at the entrance of the Nritta Sabha in the Nataraja <br />temple at Chidambaram. <br /><br />source below, got quite of lot of interesting anecdotes...check out <br />more below<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karaikal.gov.in/SDS/2007Thirunallar.htm">http://karaikal.gov.in/SDS/2007Thirunallar.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />THE TEMPLE AT THIRUNALLAR <br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />Temples are sambolic of the abode of God and eventhough countless <br />numbers of them are extent in our land they are only so many <br />microcosms of the macrcosm the abode of milk is the cow but the <br />nectar could be extracte only from the under through teats of this <br />sacred animanal similarly God though transcendent is immanent in the <br />temple and is cognizable only there in.<br />For milleniums the Hindus have been extremely Godloving, and all <br />over the land temples were built by the rulers, or the scions of <br />rulers, and no wonder the poet warns us 'not to dwell in a place <br />where a temple is non-existent'.<br /><br />In the Thanjavur District studded with scores of temples the exists <br />in Tirunallar near Karaikal, the former French territory, the <br />ancient temple of Darbharanyeswara. This temple was visited by the <br />Saint Tirugnana Sambandar in the 7th century A.D. who sang padigams <br />(decadal verses) in praise of the Lord. Likewise, his contemporary <br />Saint Tirnnavukkarasu and later, Saint Sundarar (9th century A.D.) <br />had visited the temple and sung padigams extolling the Lord. Saint <br />Arunagirinathar (15th century A.D.) had also visited it and sung <br />hymns included in his monumental work Tiruppugazh.<br /><br />THE PACCHAI PADIGAM<br /><br />It is unique glory of the Tirunallar temple that it possesses the <br />Pacchai Padigam which occupies a pride of place in the history of <br />the Hindu Saivite Tamil hymnal literature. This padigam extols the <br />virtues of the Lord and begins with the opening line Bhogamartha <br />Poon Mulayal a pecan to the consort of Lord Darbharanyeswara.  <br />And it is said to have stood and ordeal of fire and the event <br />leading to it is of absorbing interest and is narrated below.<br /><br />It took place in the 7th century A.D, in Madurai, the capital of the <br />Pandya Kingdom, during the reign of the celebrated Koon Pandya, <br />also called Ninraseernedumaran. It was the time when the Jains had <br />spread their influence and far and wide, In the Pandya Kingdom. The <br />king had become a convert to Jainism and actively promoted its <br />growth in his kingdom. Long all but his queen Mangaiyarkarasi and <br />his minister Kulacchirai Nayanar - both stunch Saivaits - had <br />embraced Jainism, forsaking the old religion.This caused immense <br />agony to the queen and the minister who were anxious to reclaim  <br />the king and the kingdom back to the traditional religion.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />1. Pacchai - the ever gree; Padigam - decadal verse.<br />2. (Devi) with shapaly breasts adorned with jewels so pleasing to <br />the Lord.<br />3. Histrians idendify Koon Pandya (the hunch-backed Pandya) with  <br />Arikesari <br />Parankusa Maravarman.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To these two grief stricken individuals came the good tidings of <br />the camping of boy saint Tirugnana Sambandar at Vedaranyam.  <br />Having heard of the miracles performed by the Saivait saint <br />young Sambandar in the Thanjavur district, they sent an urgent <br />invitation to him to visit Madurai and extricate the king and his <br />subjects from the clutches of the Jains. It would appear that  <br />while the queen's messengers found a ready response in the boy <br />saint it was not easy where his "admirer and companion saint" Appar <br />was concerned. In the words of Sekkizhar and thus spoke Appar, the <br />king of Divine speech. Thouat but a stripling. There is no end to <br />the deceits and treacheries of the Jains. There is one further <br />objection. The planets stand baleful. So you shold not agree to <br />go. Unto which the high-souled Sambandar repiled . "If what I <br />think and praise constantly are the tinkling feer of our Lord, <br />no harm will touch me". So saying the cheif of the Puhali town, <br />Sambandar ever bound unto the rosy fragrant feet of God. Sang the  <br />PADIGAM begining with the Lord of Uma with bamboo - like shapely <br />shoulders". The saint then be took himself to Madurai.<br /><br />The arrival of the Saivate Saint roused the suspicion of the Jains <br />who resorted to the heinous act of setting fire to his holy <br />dwelling. But by his yogic powers, Sambandar had the heat <br />transferred to the king which burut his person inexorably Lo! the <br />king was wriggling like a warm unable to stand the pain, which <br />the scorching heat that had taken hold of his person produced.   <br />Then the youthful saint sang the padigam 'Mandiramavadu Neeru' <br />(the saered ash is the mandra etc.,) and sprinkled a few grains of <br />the ash on the right side of the king's body. The Jains in  <br />their turn chanting the Aruga Mantra (Jain Mantra) stroked the left <br />side of the King's person with peacock feathers, but it only <br />aggravated the pain! Entreated by the king and his ministers, <br />Sambandar applied a few more grains of the sacred ash on to his <br />left side also. It was a wonder of wonders that the poor pandya  <br />monarch who a little while ago was the very picture of <br />suffering, misery and distress was now smiling gaily and appeared  <br />wholly freed from the burning malady. Lo! the King was rid of his <br />hump too! And at this moment, it may be said that the triumph of <br />Saivism over Jainism was more than established in the Pandya <br />capital and the unwanted religion just faded out ignominiously.<br /><br />But the Jains were not as yet wiser by their abject defeat1. They <br />arrogantly threw the challenge that both religionsts should  <br />write down their respective Mantras on a palm leaf and consign it <br />to the flames and the one that survived the ordeal of the <br />established its superiority over the other.<br /><br />The King must have been impressed by the miraculous performance of <br />Gnana Sambandar's treatment just with a pinch of sacred ash and <br />he might also have been possibly distreesed at the collapse of the <br />religion to which he was a votary, namely Jainism. It was at this <br />juncture that the Jains threw the aforesaid challenge as they were <br />convinced that the king was in two minds in the approach to the <br />two respective religions. The Saint also wanted to convince him of <br />the superiority of Saivism over the other. And so, he accepted  <br />the challenge and the Jains first threw their Mantra into the fire  <br />which became forthwith a prey to the flames! Sambandar them <br />caused his Tirumurai to be brought there and pulled one leaf  <br />from the bundle and his leaf contained a verse of the forty -  <br />ninth Padigam of Tevaram entitled "Bhogamartha Poon Mulayal" <br />which was sung carlier by the saint in the Darbaranyeswara shrine <br />at Tirunallar. He consigned it to the flames. But his palm  <br />bearing leaf was not scorched by the fire. It maintained its <br />evergreen freshness! Unconsumed by the fierce flames of the fire it <br />remained absolutely unscatched and this miracle established. The <br />glory of saivism which to this day is as Green as it was before  <br />it was subjected to the fire ordeal! Hence the <br />appellation "Pacchai Padigam" was being applied to it.<br /><br />Bhogamartha Poon Mulayal is also called by the name of Praneswari <br />as she gave life (Prana) or rebirth to Saivism.<br /><br />PLACE NAME<br /><br />The name "TIRUNALLARU" is said to represent the association of Nala <br />of the Nishadha country who got his deliverance from the evil <br />effects of Shani (Saturn) by invoking the Lord's mercy here.  <br />(Nala+Aru-Nallaru). The word "Aru" also conveys the meaning "to <br />heel" and the two words taken together will mean Nala's place <br />of redemption or the pace where Nala secured his redemption  <br />from the hold of Saturn through the Lord's Grace. Others are  <br />inclined to read the meaning 'between rivers' in the name Nal-<br />Aru, as this place is situated in the midst of two rivers in the <br />north i.e. Noolaru and Vanchiaru, and one in the south, Arasalaru.<br /><br />And this name as such occurs in the earlier padikam as wel as in <br />the Inscriptions. Besides, the name of Nallaru this sacred plaee <br />has also other name such as Adipuri, Darbharanyam, Nagavidangapuram, <br />Naleswaram etc<br /><br /><br />THE TEMPLE AND THE TANKS<br /><br />Since [the principal deity Darbharanyeswara his consort Praneswari, <br />Shaniswar and the several other gods and goddesses enshrined here <br />have the power to offer benedictions to the devotees, hundreds of <br />them visit this temple daily. There is the additional attraction <br />of several sacred tanks which exist here and which are said to, <br />possess healing powers literally as well as metaboically.<br /><br />A beautiful Rajagopuram in five tiers resing to the sky and adorned <br />with an abundance of terracotta sculpture as we approach the <br />temple. As one enters and perambulates round the eircumambulatory <br />path this shirne of Kalathinathar and Karpakavinayakar are seen <br />which are readily worshipped. The images of the four great  <br />Shive Saint besides those of the 63 - Nayanmars are  <br />represented at the turn of the southeren Prakara of the temple, <br />and noteworthy feature here is the image of Nala house in a <br />separate shrine at the end of the gallery of the 63 - Nayanmars.  <br />On the westren path are seen three figures having uam  <br />stackable sage-like appearance. And it is believed that one of <br />them is, that of the Chola king Raja Raja, it is food for <br />researchers as this image is so strikingly similar to the one  <br />found at the entrance of the Nritta Sabha in the Nataraja <br />temple at Chidambaram. The other notable deities in this line are <br />Swarna Vinayaka and Subramanya.<br /><br />The image of Lord Shaniswara is seen in a graceful standing pose <br />housed in niche on the left side of the Lord's Sannithi. He is  <br />shedding benevolence as he is wearing the aspect of Anugrahamum <br />and a Perennial stream of Bhaktas throng here to worship  <br />Him and obtain His grace throughout the year on important <br />festival days.<br /><br />According to legends, Shani is the son of the Sun [the Chief of the <br />solar system] by Chhaya, the shadow of Samine his wife. He was <br />ordered by his father to take his pace amongst the planets and  <br />engage himself in meeting out joys and sorrows to mortals in <br />proportion to the merits and demerits earned by them in their past <br />lives.<br /><br />Shaniswara is very much sought after by countless millions of <br />devotees on the day when the Planet Saturn [worshipped as  <br />Shaniswara] transits front one zoditical sign to another. This day <br />is great occasion here and abhishekas, archhnas, pujas, aradhanas <br />and naivedyas are offered to the Lord continuously the whoe day <br />for mitigation of the scorching effeets his influence produces on <br />those to pass through Shani Dasa in their lives.<br /><br /><br />There are several tanks here which are considered highly <br />sanctified. They are respectively Brahma Tirtha, Vani  <br />Tirtha, Hamsa Tirtha, Agasthia Tirtha, Nala Tirtha, etc., The <br />Sthala Vriksha here is the Darbha plant [Kusa grass].<br /><br />The Lord Darbharanyeswara is offered pujas six times a day and Lord <br />Shaniswara five times a day.<br /><br />Shaniswara has also other names such as Mandam [dullard Pangu[lame] <br />Kartam [biack man] etc. Since the takes nearly three decadeo <br />complete one orbit round the sun he is reckoned as a very slow <br />moving planet. The name Sanaichara means slow moving. And his <br />vehicle is the crow the familiar black brid. The colour of his <br />graments is also black.<br /><br /><br />According to astrology, Saturn is the Lord of the houses. <br />Makhara[Capricorn] and Kumbha [Aquarius]. He is exalted in the  <br />house Thula[Libra] and is Ayurkaraka or in other words, governs <br />our life span, Sesame or the gingelli is his favourite seed and <br />cooked rice mixed with sesame is the favourite naivedana.<br /><br /><br />The Siloatatnakara mentions the eagle as his vehicle. It is also <br />said that lamps fed with gingili oil and lighted before him  <br />reduces the intensity of his malelife and saturday being his <br />day in the week the offerings on that day of gingili oil fed <br />lamps and gingili-rice bring to the devotee great virtues besides <br />getting the saturnine influence mitigated if thiy happen to be <br />affilicted by it.<br /><br /><br />Saturn as well known as one of the 9 planets and Is the biggest in <br />the solar system next only to Jupiter. Its diameter is 71,500 miles <br />and is of a lighter density than the earth. It orbits the sun <br />taking about 29.5 years to take one full round, passing through <br />the 12 sign of the zodiac in its stride. It is 886 million miles <br />away from the Sun. And it takes 10.15 hours to make in rotation on <br />its own axis.<br /><br />PURANIC STORIES<br /><br />In days of yore, when the sages implored to suggest to them a <br />suitable site on earth to perform the Satra yaga, the latter rolled <br />out a Chakra [nemi] made of darbha [Kusa grass] which stopped  <br />at a forest [aranya] thus indicating that it was an ideal place <br />for them to do their penance. The became known as the <br />Naimisharanys. According to another version it was called <br />Naimisharanya. Because of the annihilation by the Lord here of <br />holdes of Asuras in minute [Nlmisha].<br /><br />In Naimisharanya, the famous redezvous of sages and birthplace of <br />the Puranas, God has taken the form of a Pushkarma, while in <br />forest. He exists as water, with a view to providing the sages <br />with shade, tubers and fruits so that could listen to <br />expositions of divine stories uninterruptedly without having <br />to break in order to appease their hunger thirst or to take rest.  <br />It was here that Lava and Kusa, the twin sons of Sri Rama sang  <br />the Ramayana and the sagh Parasara's son was conferred the title of <br />Veda Vyasa also Balarama was felicitated by the sages on his <br />annihilating the Asura. Balvanan and Srimad Bhagavata was retold at  <br />the commencement of KaliYuga by Sage Suka.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />5.

Varaha Purana.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Many puranic stories associated with the sacred tanks of <br />Darbharanyeswara were told in the sacred forest of Naimisharanya.<br /><br />[1] THE CURSE: A king of the Kalinga country who was cursed to take <br />the form of a wild elephant along with his queen and prince and  <br />Roam about in the wilderness because of an unpremeditated slight <br />he offered to Sage Bhagava shed his animal existence along with <br />the members of his family by Sage Narada's intercession who  <br />had directed the accursed king to go to Darbharanyeswara  <br />and manage to get a drop of the water fall on his body from the <br />head of a pilgrim who just had a dip in the sacred Brahma Thirtha.<br /><br />Accordingly, the King his Consort and son were transformed to the <br />is former *elves. When a drop of his sacred water fell on them <br />from the head of a pilgrim who was mopping his wet hair just <br />after a bath in the sacred tank.<br /><br />[2] NALAS REDEMPTION : Nala the handsome and brave king of  <br />Nishadha was married to Damayanthi, the Princess of Vidardha  <br />she choose him as her Lord in preference to celestials Jndra.  <br />Varuna, Agni and Yama, Shani who also had an eye on marrying <br />Damayanthi became enraged at this. He reviled the gods for <br />allowing a mortal to wed Damayanthi and vowed, out of sheer spite,  <br />to bring about their separation and ruin Nala also. But he had to <br />wait for twelve long years before he could find any flaw in Nala <br />whose adherence to just ce, probity and righteousness and strict <br />observance of religious were impeccable generally. On the <br />commission of a breach in the performance of his morning ablutions  <br />on a certain dry Shani took hold of him at once. Thence <br />commenced Nala's misfortunes. He played a game of dice with the <br />wicked Pushkara. He had staked his kingdom and lost but continued <br />the game unmindful of the counsels of the virtuous wife fondly <br />hoping to succeed at one stage to another, Ultimately losing <br />everything Nala left his kingdom and wildernesses. Later, he <br />forsock his wife also, who stood steadfast his companion all  <br />through, on a pitch dark night while she was asleep and wended <br />his way through the dense forest. And espying a bigserpant caught <br />ina forest fire writhing in agony, he resuced it. The serpant <br />Karkotaka in return <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> Nala its own rescuer, whose body was <br />suddenly transformed into that of a dark dwarf. Karkotaka told <br />him that this transformation in his physical appearance was a <br />service rendered to him in his own interest, which eventual  <br />happenings in his life would prove to be correct, and also gave <br />him a snake skin by donning which Nala could assume his original <br />from at will. He also advised him to go to King Ritupanna of <br />Ayodhya and learn from him the tricks employed in the play of the <br />game of dice. Progressing further. Nala reached Ayodhya and his <br />dentity being unrecognisable on account of the physical change <br />effected by the snake bite, he appreached King Ritupanna under the <br />name Bahuka and sought of him employment. He was given one which  <br />was that of the king's charioteer, Ritupanna little <br />suspecting that Bahuka was no other than Nala. A king royal who <br />had not his compeer in the three worlds in the art of horsemanship.<br /><br />Now for Damayandhi, she was greatly distressed at Nala's desernion <br />of her and roamed about the forest until she came upon a  <br />caravan whose members were very hospitable to her and agreed  <br />to take her to the neighbouring city the next morning. But as <br />ill luck would have it, that night mad elephant attacked the <br />caravan and killed the merchants. When the foriorn Damayanthi  <br />came forward voluntarily to give herself up to the animal <br />preferring death the widbeast became submissive and went its way <br />doing her no harm. Trusting in God, Damayanthi resumed her  <br />journey and reached the city of Chedi whose Queen captivated by <br />the bewitching beauty of Damayanthi allowed her to emain with her <br />as her companion and maid in the meantime some of the messengers <br />of King Bhima of Vidardha who had arrived in Chedi in search of <br />the royal couple recognized Damayanthi as their princess and  <br />she was back by the Queen to Vidarbha with a royal escort.<br /><br />Damayanthi that a minute examination of Bahuka the short,   <br />swarthy charioteer of King Ritupanna suggested that he was a great <br />personage who had gone down in life. Clever Damayanthi forthwith <br />send word through the messenger to King Riutppanna that a second <br />Swayamwara was to take place for her since Nala had deserted  <br />her. And King Ritupanna whose love for Damayanthi had never  <br />wanted even after the disappointment at the first Swayamwara got <br />ready to attend it the very next morning.<br /><br />The sight of the chariot which was whirling through the sky <br />immediately revealed to Damayanthi the charioteer's mastery over the <br />art of horsemanshop. But the charioteer locked ugly and disease!  <br />However, in and all out effort to identify Nala. Damayanthi was <br />prepared to go to any length. She employed several strategies <br />whereby she could identify some of the unique skills that Nala <br />had possessed including proficincy in the culinary arts and her <br />strategies did yield truth.<br /><br />At long Nala did get back his old majestic and handsome appearance <br />[by wearing the snake - skin]. Unlessing the reunited couple  <br />and their children King Ritupanna left Kundinapura. With  <br />the help of his father-in-law Nala marched at the head of an <br />army to Nishadha, defeated King Pushkar in gambirg with the <br />help of knowledge of the science of numbers he had acquired <br />from King Ritupanna, and took back possession of his lost kingdom.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the restoration of his lost fortune. Nala was <br />still dogged by misery and unhappiness owing to the effects of Shani <br />and on the advice of Sage Bharadwaja at Vriddhachalam he came to <br />Tirunallar where, after a bath in the sacred Brahma Tirtea he <br />regained his mental equipoise, and peace of mind was restored to him <br />thereafter.<br /><br />He sojowrned for a few days at the sacred shrine dug a tank which <br />was named Nala Tirth after him and got the temple renovated.  <br />Whoever has a bath in this tank should be blessed. He prayed to the <br />lord fermently, "And be free saturaline influence" and the lord <br />granted his prayer.<br /><br />[3] REDEMPTION FROM THE SIN OF COW KILLING : King Thooyakanda,  <br />ruler of Vedavarthana situation on the bank of the river  <br />Godavari, begot a son after long penances and fulfulling many <br />vows and presented riches and cows to the Brahmins who had conducted <br />a Yaga [Putrakmeshti] for the birth of an heir apparent to the King.<br /><br />Two Brahmins who were also recipients of cows found that one of <br />them had a bigger size cow than the other. Simitten by jealousy <br />and envy they both quarelled violently which ended in mutual <br />exchange of blows with sticks. Unfortunately a severe blow landed <br />on one of the animals which died instantaneously. Gohatya or  <br />the sin of killing a cow, though unpremeditated, overtook  <br />the Brabmin who immediately became transformed into a low class <br />human being and was blind too.<br /><br />The unfortunate Brahmin sought the advice of Sage Romasha who <br />directed him to repair to Darbharaya and seek redemption for his <br />sin from the Lord after taking a bath in the Hamsa Tirtha.  <br />Accordingly the Brahmin went there and a drop of water from the <br />head of a woman pilgrim who had just bathed in then sacred <br />waters of the tank and was drying her hair landed on him. And  <br />Lal immediately he got back his Original Form and sight, the sin <br />of Cow Killing having been absolved.<br /><br />[4] URUCHI OF AVANTI: Uruchi, the King of Avanti, once <br />sudplicated before the Sage Bharadwaja who came to his court <br />followed by a few other sages implored the later to advice him as <br />to which and of the numerous forms of charities was most suderior  <br />to the others. This sage suggested Annadana or serving food to the <br />starving and added that if this service was performed in Darbharanya <br />Kshetra the donor would earn plenty of merit. Following this <br />advice, the king processed to Darbharanya and worshipped the Lord <br />and offered. Him sincere prayers. The Lord appeared before him <br />and asked him to ask for a boon. The king beseeched the Lord to <br />bless him with His everlasting Grace and the means to offer food to <br />those who sought of him. On obtaining the lord's boon the King  <br />remained in this Sacred Place for long devoting Himself to the <br />Service of the poor and Feeding and Hungry.<br /><br />[5] AGNIVANNAR: Two sons of a merchant prince bearing the same name <br />of Agnivannar got into lustful ways and ran through their fortunes <br />in no time and became penniless.<br /><br />Having nothing to feld for themselves and har put to the necessity <br />of keeping their body and soul together, they turned highway <br />robbers, and hiding in jungles overpowered stray travellers, <br />killed them and seized their possessions.<br /><br />Once a sage happening to pass by their haunt, was also subjected to <br />the same inhuman treatment by the robbers. The sage after  <br />giving them wise, counsel advised them to lead a normal  <br />life he took them to Darbharanya where these who fallen brothers <br />attained salvation after taking a bath in the Hamsa Dirtha and <br />worshipping, the lord and offering prayers to Him for many Days.<br /><br /><br /><br />A SAPTHA VIDANGA SHRINE<br /><br />Thirunallar has claims to additional impartance as the Second of <br />the seven Saptha Vidanga Sthalas. In other words, this  <br />sacred place enshrines a naturally formed Marakatha   <br />[emerald] linga known as Navagavidanga which is the second out <br />of the seven images gifted the Indra to a Chola King by name.<br /><br />Muchukunda, who installed them respectively at Tituvarur, <br />Tirunallaru, Tiruvoimur, Tirukkarayil, Tirukkuvalai [or <br />Tirukkolili], Tirunagaikaronam [Nagapattinam] and Tirumaraikkadu <br />[Vedaranyam] Siva the King of dances, performs the Unmatha dance in <br />this Kshetra.<br /><br />The sanctum on the left side of Tyagaraja has the Marakathalinga <br />kept in an iron safe. Abhishekas and pujas are offered to it five <br />times a day.<br /><br />It is computed that there are 17 Sivalingas in this sacred place <br />includind Darbharanyeswara in the main shirne and those that the <br />lords of the 8 cardinal points [Dik Palakas] has established and <br />worshipped along with a sacred tank in each of the cardinal <br />points to which they are respectively accredited.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />8.

A milkman was supplying milk in the temple daily on the <br />orders of the local king. But the accountant of the temple asked <br />the milkman to deliver the milk at his house and enter it in the <br />temple accounts. But the honest milkman who demurred to the <br />instructions of the accountant was threatened with drastic action <br />by the latter.<br /><br />The helpless milkman could only seck justiee from Lord <br />Darbharanyeswara, who irked by the accountant's malfeasance  <br />wished to punishd him and released his lance in his direction. And <br />as the Balipitha was in line with the coures of the lauce it is said <br />to have moved a little away from its position to clear the way for <br />the passage of the hurtling lance.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />10.

"Sri Saneeswara <br />Baghavan (SATURN) transits from Kadaga Rasi (CANCER) to Simha Rasi <br />(LEO) on 05/08/2007 at 12:19 P.M."   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The following is a reproduction of the artice contribution by the <br />author to the Indian Express Madras, in commemoration of the  <br />transit of Lord Saturn which took place on Monday the 18th August <br />1975 at 11,13 p.m.<br /><br />In the Solar system Saturn is the biggest planet and is only next <br />to Jupiter in magnitude. It is 886 million miles distant from the <br />Sun and its diameter is 71,500 miles. It takes 29.46 years to <br />complete one orbit around the sun, progressing through the 12 <br />signs of the zodiac in this duration. And it is breath-taking to <br />realize that the earth's diameter is 7918 miles and is about 1/10 <br />of the size of the giant planet. Its density is just 1/8 of that of <br />the earth. And its one unique feature is that three rings of  <br />dense planets, It has eight satellites and two more have been <br />added to this number by subsequent researches. It rotates on its <br />axis in about 10-15 hours. It is identified with the ancient  <br />italion god of agriculture and animal husbandry.<br /><br />The science of astrology credits the planet "with producing cold. <br />sluggish and gloomy temperament in those born under its  <br />influence". Besides it is said to give bountiful prosperity or <br />the opposite of it compounded with plenty of misery and sorrow <br />to al those who come under its influence.<br /><br />Even though seepties may not accept it astrologically it is an <br />accepted fact that all the nine planets influence the humans in <br />their day to day life from birth to death, by conferring on  <br />them penury or prosperity, intelligence or stupidity,  <br />happiness or sorrow health or sickness. longevity or untimely <br />death in proportion to the merits or sins earned by them in their <br />previous births.<br /><br />The kings of old had in their courts astrologers to advise them in <br />their day-to-day activities.<br /><br />Sages like Varaha Mihira and Jaimini appear to have been <br />progenitors of the science of astrologn in India. This science  <br />is also said to have been practised in ancient Babyion known as <br />the Chaldea system of astrology. The west today has developed  <br />astrology perhaps drawing inspiration from the Indian and the <br />Chaldean systems. And the fact that astrological redings or <br />prediotions are popular features in most of the current day  <br />periodicals is indicative of the measure of its hold on the <br />classes and the masses. A branch of this science developed as  <br />mundane astrology prediots wars, famines, foods, deluges.  <br />Pestilenes the rise and fall of an country and its political <br />changes and vicissitudes, and so on. It may be recalled in this <br />context that the moon's phasls affect the ocean tides.<br /><br />And hence it is not without significiance that in all the Shiva <br />shrines in South India there is a Nava Graha [9 planets] corner <br />with the sun at the centre and the other eight planets crowding <br />around him facing in different directions. The devoters do not <br />fail to visit this part of the shrine for circumambularion and <br />worship to earn benefits and absolution from sins.<br /><br />At Suryanar Koil [Thanjavur District] there is a separate temple <br />for the Sun similar to the one at Konark in Orissa. And at <br />Tirunallar [a commune of Kariakal, Pondicherry State] in a niche <br />in the main shrine of Sri Darbharanyeswara it housed the stone <br />image of Saturn around the prakara.<br /><br />Saturn is a malefic planet and he is generally feared must for evil <br />propensities. This plant takes roughly 2.6 years to transit  <br />from one zodiacal sign to another and takes 30 years <br />apportunately for him to complete his full round taking in his <br />strides all the 12 zodiacal signs in this buration. And on account <br />of the long time taken by him for completing one round he is <br />nicknamed Mandan [dullard] Pangu [the name planet] and so on.<br /><br />In his rounds when he posits in the house in the horoscope of a <br />native immediately dnterior to the one occupied by the moon, the <br />native is said to commence his 7.5 years period of Shani Dasa [Sade <br />Sathi], in other words 7.5 years dasa period is reckoned by <br />Saturn's transit through the house anterior to the oue occupied <br />by the moon in on hornscobe, and then the house in which he is <br />posited and the one next to it there after, to eross all of  <br />which, at the rate of 2,5 years for each, the total period taken <br />is 7.5 years.<br /><br />On account of his possessing supreme powers for producing misery <br />and unhappiness his transits from one house to another is looked <br />upon with great signifieance. And in the Shiva tempes al over  <br />South India the devotees do poojas, archanas and invoke other <br />forms of pacificatory tituals to mondify his as best as they can.<br /><br />And the day of transit known as the Shanipeyarchi is very important <br />to the devotees of Saturn who in their thousands will throng at <br />Tirunallar to workship him, as the deity in this shrine is said to <br />be wearing a benign aspect and hence can be looked forward to <br />bless them and redeem them of their sins.<br /><br />About 300 kilometers South of Madras, near Karaikal in Pondicherry <br />State, is situated the famous and unique temple of  <br />Darbharayeswara enshrining Saturn in the Prakara of the temple in <br />a niche and for the benefit of the devotees a separate entrance <br />is provided for easy acces to him. Saturn is generally found only <br />in the Navagraha cluster or gallery in all South Indian Temples  <br />and it is rare and unusual to find him alone separated from the <br />company of the other planets.<br /><br />The three great Tevaram hymnists, Sambandar, Appar [7th century] <br />and Sundarar [9th century] have visited the temple of Sri <br />Darbharanyeswara and sung padigams in praise of the Lord King Nala <br />of Nishadha country who was afficted severely by Shaniswara to the <br />extend of his losing his kingdom and physical elegance and <br />suffering separation from his wife and children besides the  <br />humilill of having to serve as a charioteer to the King of <br />Ayodhya is said to have redeemed himself from the grips of  <br />Saturn the moment he entered the Darbharanyeswara shrine and Saturn <br />did not pursue him inside the shrine but remained outside. Nala <br />thereafter offered workship to Sri Narayana and this derity is <br />today associated with Nala's name and is knwon as Nala Narayana <br />Perumal.<br /><br />The name Tirunallar comprises two syllables Nal or Nala+Aru <br />apparently pointing to the association of Nala with this sacred  <br />place, whose other names are Darbharanyam, Nagavidangapuram, <br />Naleswaram and so on.<br /><br />And according to the Sthalapuranam there were once 13 sacred tanks <br />here of which only five exist today. The principal one among them <br />is Nala Tirtha which is situated on the northwestern side of the <br />main temple. A dip in the sacred waters of this tank absolves <br />one of all his sins and diseases and he is blessed with abundant <br />virtues.<br /><br />Since the three Nayanmars had visited it at sung padigams the <br />temple should have been famous and popular even anterior to the  <br />time of Tirugnana Sambandar [7th Century]. On the north wall of <br />the mandapa in front of the Darbharanyeswara shrine there   <br />is a incomplete. Tami inscription ascribed to Rajakesarivarman <br />alias Rajakesarivarman Tirubhuvan Chakravarthi Rajathi Raja II, <br />which is dated to the 11th reginal year [1173 A.D.] of this Chola  <br />King. And in the same wall there is another Tamil inscription   <br />[incomplete] of the Chola King Tirubhuvan Chakravarthi <br />Kulothunga Chola Deva III the conqueror of Madurai, datable to  <br />the last quarter of the 12th Century A.D. in the year 1195.</div>

			<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br /><br /><br />The "Sambandar" + Koon Pandyan incident is very famous<br />incident in the history of Madurai Meenakshi Temple (My home town in<br />Madurai). Even today the same incident is depicted as drawings in the temple<br />and one of the temple activities is to do the same Pooja what Sambandar did<br />and the sacred ash is kept in the temple just below the pictures.<br /><br />Another important thing is that the characters of the<br />incident Koon Pandyan (Nedumaran), Mangayarkarassi and Kulachiryar are<br />coming in our Kalki's "Sivakamiyin Sampatham" where there is a short history<br />of how Nedumaran became a strong Jainism follower initially.<br /><br />The story of Madurai and Meenakshi Temple is equally<br />thrilling, interesting and exciting like our Cholas and P.S. The temple has<br />seen various kings, kingdoms and miracles. I will share with some these<br />incidents.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Lakshman<br /><br /><br /><br />_____<br /><br />From:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com[mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com]<br />On Behalf Of Sundar<br />Sent: Friday, August 10, 2007 3:58 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> statue in thirunallar??<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote:<br /><br /><br /><br />Having heard of the miracles performed by the Saivait saint<br />young Sambandar in the Thanjavur district, they sent an urgent<br />invitation to him to visit Madurai and extricate the king and his<br />subjects from the clutches of the Jains. It would appear that<br />while the queen's messengers found a ready response in the boy<br />saint it was not easy where his "admirer and companion saint" Appar<br />was concerned. In the words of Sekkizhar and thus spoke Appar, the<br />king of Divine speech. Thouat but a stripling. There is no end to<br />the deceits and treacheries of the Jains. There is one further<br />objection. The planets stand baleful. So you shold not agree to<br />go. Unto which the high-souled Sambandar repiled . "If what I<br />think and praise constantly are the tinkling feer of our Lord,<br />no harm will touch me". So saying the cheif of the Puhali town,<br />Sambandar ever bound unto the rosy fragrant feet of God. Sang the<br />PADIGAM begining with the Lord of Uma with bamboo - like shapely<br />shoulders". The saint then be took himself to Madurai.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------------<br /><br /><br />I think this PADIGAM is called " KOL ARU PADIGAM"<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sundar<br /><br />.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />_____<br /><br />Pinpoint<br /> customers<br />who are looking for what you sell.</div>
