			<div class="content">Speaking about Mathuranthaka - we should make a clear cut<br />distinction between historical Mathuranthaka Uttama Chozha and the<br />Senthan amudhan-turned-mathuranthaka of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br /><br />Senthan amudhan is a fictional character - personification of soft<br />hearted men of great character and ideals. He is also human and down<br />to earth - he says he will prefer poonguzhali over sivabhakthi<br />loka <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />But I'm not here to discuss Senthan amudhan in detail. My interest<br />is with Mathuranthaka Uttama Chola - as history portrys him and the<br />facts that go with or contradict what is said in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> about that guy.<br /><br />First and foremost point of interest is that initially senthan<br />amudhan was not intented to be converted to Mathuranthaka by Kalki.<br />The reasons for this sudden change of mind on Kalki's side - in<br />itself - is a point of great debade. But I'll not go into it. All<br />I'd like to say here is the exact incident as portrayed by Kalki's<br />son Mr.Rajendran:<br /><br />One day Kalki was doing Yogasana - every day morning he had the<br />habit of doing that. (Remember that Yogacharya Sundaram's widely<br />acclaimed series on Yoga featured as a series in Kalki - in those<br />days.) And it was boy Rajendran's duty - every day - to count<br />numbers for his father when he was doing Sirasasanam - a posture of<br />standing upside down!<br /><br />On the given day - after recovering from asana posture - Kalki<br />suddenly asked the boy : Senthan Amudhanaye Raja Aaki vittal enna ?<br />(Why not make Sendhan Amudhan a king ?)<br /><br />Of course, Kalki should have thought about this afterwords also -<br />before coming to a conclusion. But in my own humble opinion, the<br />historical mathuranthaka looks more like the earlier mathuranthaka<br />than the pious Senthan amudhan !<br /><br />Any evidences ? Well, I have more than one !<br /><br />Before looking at how Mathuranthaka took the throne, it is important<br />to consider how Aditya was recognized as the heir apparent by<br />Sundara chola.<br /><br />As <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> portrays, since mathurantaka was too small when his father<br />(Gandaraditya) and uncle (Arinjaya) died - sundara chola came to<br />throne. But once mathuranthaka came to age, Sundara chola - instead<br />of recognizing him as the next king - makes his own son as the heir<br />apparent.<br /><br />We do not know the reasons behind this - and are not in a position<br />to accept what kalki says - that Paranthaka/ Gandaraditya wished<br />Sundara chola and his heirs to continue to claim the chola throne.<br />We do not have any evidence to this.<br /><br />Once good reason could be that Aditya was a great warrior for his<br />age and was - as against what kalki portrays - a pious and<br />intelligent son as well. We will take a look at Aditya in detail<br />later - but for now, let us assume that Aditya was able to surpass<br />Mathurantaka by his own valour, which seems to be the most probable<br />conclusion against the available evidence.<br /><br />No doubt, there were a group of people in the kingdom as well as<br />around Mathuranthaka - who were revolting against this and perhaps<br />Mathuranthaka himself was not happy with this! (as vividly portrayed<br />in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>) As aditya became more and more famous - installing himself<br />deeper and deeper into the throne - Mathuranthaka may have<br />visualized a may day for him and his generations to come. Moreover,<br />he might have felt that this was wrong - morally and ethically.<br /><br />Sundara should have tried to convice him - saying that a man like<br />Aditya alone can save the country against rising enemy power all<br />around the empire. It is absolutely possible that our man was not<br />convinced about all this and - in the company of some "dangerous<br />fellows" - decided to play his dice.<br /><br />Let us see the historic evidences that stand for and against the<br />theory that Mathuranthaka indeed conspired to kill Aditya. To do<br />this effectively, we need to look at what happened AFTER aditya's<br />killing as well as the reign of Uttama chola as a whole.<br /><br />Evidence 1 : The very first evidence that throws some light into<br />this is the Thiruvalangadu plates. They say pretty clearly that the<br />country men wanted to bring Arumozhi as the next prince but Arumozhi<br />declined - saying that AS LONG AS HIS UNCLE UTTAMA CHOZHA WISHES -<br />HE WILL NOT CONSIDER - EVEN MENTALLY ABOUT SUCEEDING THE CHOZHA<br />THRONE.<br /><br />You can view this in different angles. One view - taken by<br />T.V.Sadasiva pandarathar - a noted historian - is that Arumozhi had<br />so much respect in his uncle that he procalimed this statment.<br /><br />If you read Kalki's conclusion to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - you will understand that the<br />whole story is based on this sacrifice of Arumozhi and that is why<br />Part 5 is aptly named THIYAGA CHIGARAM (Pinnacle of sacrifice).<br />Thus, Kalki has accepted T.V.P's conclusions as a whole.<br /><br />But there is also another angle - which we can consider. The most<br />important thing that is visible from Thiruvalangadu inscriptions is<br />that UTTAMA DID WISH FOR THE THRONE. Thus, in order to avoid a<br />serious domestic conflict - Arumozhi decided to give room for his<br />uncle's wishes.<br /><br />It is absolutely possible that the power camps were divided in this<br />issue - as <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> succintly portrays - and since the overall chola<br />empire was under the threat of disintegration - Arumozhi gave way<br />for Uttama and decided to move his coins cautiously - as Uttama did.<br /><br />From: what I've written so far - you should have got my opinion: That<br />Arumozhi had his own plans in giving up the chola throne<br />tentatively - in the light of domestic confusions and the death of<br />crown prince.<br /><br />I'll try substantiate this as we go along.<br /><br />Evidence 2 : Pandyas had been the sworne enemies of cholas since<br />time immemorial. We are all aware that bitter battles were faught<br />between the two throughout the later Chola regime. Vijayala /<br />Aditya, Paranthaka, Gandaradhitya (?) - and ofcourse, Paranthaka II<br />(Sundara chola) - all had to fight Pandya revolt at some point of<br />their time.<br /><br />In fact Paranthaka had to fight more than once - to supress Pandya<br />king Veera Pandiya. Once such war was faught in sevur - in which<br />veera pandiyan lost his life.<br /><br />If you go a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> further - you'll find that Rajaraja the great began<br />his historic conquest first from Pandya country (though Kandalur<br />Salai battle with cheras is considered the first - Rajarja had to<br />first cross the pandya empire even to reach Kandhalur. Thus, he had<br />to supress Amarabhujanga, the then pandyan emperor - before<br />proceeding to chera country).<br /><br />My simple question is : WHY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PANDYA REVOLT<br />DURING UTTAMA'S TIME - FOR 15 LONG YEARS?<br /><br />It is evident that Pandyas were alive and well during this period -<br />because Rajaraja's first battle with them and subsequent battles<br />with cheras (in which Pandyas obviously alighned with cheras to<br />overcome chola power) - were neverthless easy victories. Thus we<br />cannot say that Pandyas were too weak to plan any revolt in this<br />period.<br /><br />Evidence 3 : By right, history should have seen a chola - pandya<br />fight very close to Aditya chola's death. The confusion that was<br />prevailing in chola empire was obvious - there were confusions as to<br />who might be the successor and it was a very good time for pandya's<br />to capitalize this. But they didn't.<br /><br />One arguement could be that there were no pandya emperors in the<br />meanwhile. But this is strange - considering the way Pandyas<br />organised themselves. Because, Pandya's called themselves as<br />descendents of Pancha Pandavas and to make people believe this -<br />more than one ruler was available at any point of time. Of course,<br />they all had a supreme leader among themselves - who was called the<br />emperor - but the important thing is there were always some royal<br />guys to replace a leader.<br /><br />There are many many evidences available to prove this - it is<br />difficult for me to detail them here. The overall point implied here<br />is that Pandyas might have had their own leader who replaced<br />Veerapandya - probably the Amarabhujanga - when Aditya was killed.<br /><br />There was a 3 year gap between Sevur Battle and Aditya's death - a<br />sufficiently long gap for the pandyas to identify their next leader.<br /><br />Evidence 4 : It is quite interesting to note that Mathuranthaka<br />either had no issues or had some issues who could not come to power.<br />T.V.S. Pandarathar talks about certain 'Mathuranthaka" who was<br />working as a temple supervisor in Rajaraja's times and says that he<br />was the son of Uttama chola. I'm not sure whether his claim was<br />based on any evidences or not. Remember that even Rajendra had the<br />name madhuranthaka before he became a king.<br /><br />Arumozhi was recognised as the heir apparent during uttama's time.<br />If Uttama had children, they should have come to power either during<br />his own life time or after Rajaraja. But surprisingly, we find that<br />issues of Utttama chola are not even tracable very clearly - leave<br />alone the issue of coming to power.<br /><br />It is difficult to accept that theory that Uttama did'nt have any<br />children - considering the fact that he had many wives - unless.<br /><br />Taking TVS theory that he had a son, why was he not given a very<br />high position or recognized in Rajaraja's times ? What happened to<br />the generations that followd? At a much later date, we find that a<br />completely new breed of cholas (chalukya - cholas) were allowed to<br />regin the kingdom after Athi Rajendra. It is quite surprising that<br />the issues of Uttama chola could not make a headway into the royal<br />frontiers at all.<br /><br />It somehow seems that the whole generation was disregarded - in<br />terms of power - since Rajaraja. Why did the generation did not<br />revolt? After all, going by the chola practice - the crown belongs<br />to the generation of uttama more than arumozhi.<br /><br />Was it true that Rajaraja and Rajendra completely overshadowed the<br />other branch by their sheer valour? Or was it a deliberate attempt<br />to sideline the generation of Uttama who committed a henious crime<br />to sieze the throne?</div>
