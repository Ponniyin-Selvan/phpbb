			<div class="content">Hi all<br /><br />not only the person but the period must have been fantastic<br />( in the retrospective)- not for guys living at that time<br /><br />a period when the line between a ruler and a robber was very thin. a <br />period when lotsa of non royals became blue blooded ones.<br />the poligar times is a fantastic political play ground in the <br />history of tamilnadu.<br /><br />maruthu pandyar, umai thurai, kattaboman, thondaimans, the french <br />and the british battling it out in the land and the sea( sadras <br />kalpakkam is famous for its anglo french naval battles)<br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Mr Venkatesh;<br />  <br />  This is really a lot of information about Marudanayagam!!!<br />  What a fantastic character this man must have been. He has been a<br />  Hindu,learnt his 3 R&#39;s in a christian household,had an affair with <br />a<br />  Frenchwoman,married a parangi, and converted to Islam. Has there <br />ever been a<br />  more diverse individual? Maybe a complete book in English about <br />this person<br />  would be a best seller. The only way for letting the world know <br />about our<br />  heroes would be to write their memoirs in English and sell them <br />abroad<br />  through a renowned publisher. If only wishes were horses...<br />  May our fabled land produce more Marudanayagam&#39;s<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  Rahul<br />  <br />  On 2/22/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br />   <br />    heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net<br />   <br />    Tradition has many stories to tell of this remarkable man, who is<br />    commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation for Khan <br />Sahib.<br />    He was born in the Rammnad country and was originally a Hindu of <br />the<br />    Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took Service under a<br />    European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed, served <br />under<br />    another European &#40;who educated him&#41;, went to the Nawab&#39;s court, <br />rose<br />    rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and eventually, as <br />has<br />    been seen, became Commandant of all the Company&#39;s sepoys. His<br />    executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report &#40;see<br />    below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and entitled &#39;A<br />    view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was republished in<br />    Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and Madura &#39;his whole<br />    administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />    unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were happily<br />    combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge from<br />    punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example shows<br />    that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or <br />complexion.&#39;<br />   <br />   <br />    Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />    The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the country,<br />    renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very moderate <br />sum<br />    of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of 1759 and <br />began<br />    by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting avenues <br />through<br />    their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they fled, or<br />    executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He went on <br />to<br />    reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had sobered all<br />    the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even had the<br />    audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without the <br />knowledge<br />    or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he <br />offered to<br />    lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven lakhs <br />per<br />    annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was enraged at <br />this,<br />    or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his <br />masters--<br />    he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began to <br />collect<br />    troops.<br />   <br />    He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />    In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him and he <br />was<br />    besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all deserted<br />    him, but he held out until October 1764 with great energy and <br />skill,<br />    renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--he is <br />said<br />    to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly employed<br />    3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault with a<br />    loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed and <br />wounded.<br />    At the end of that time little real progress against him had been<br />    made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded, but he <br />was<br />    treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in charge of <br />the<br />    French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles Campbell, who<br />    commanded the English among the besiegers. He was ignominiously<br />    hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of Madura, and <br />his<br />    body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was afterwards<br />    erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to the left of <br />the<br />    read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and is known<br />    as &#39;Khan Sahib&#39;s pallivasal.&#39;<br />   <br />    His character<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />     <br />      hi<br />     <br />      the best book on this yusuf khan alias maduranayakam is from <br />asian<br />      educational services<br />      &#40; those red leather books with gold embossed names that you <br />see&#41;<br />     <br />     <br />      as swetha said that was a troubled time and you cant really pin<br />    down<br />      a hero or a villian<br />     <br />      but I think this guy was a conteemprory of the marudhu <br />sagodararkaL<br />     <br />      venketesh<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran"<br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        Dear Mr Venkatesh;<br />       <br />        That was a fantastic article, really informative.<br />    Marudhanayagam&#39;s<br />      life is<br />        very similar to the Mel Gibson movie "Braveheart".

Did you mean Marudhanayagam? There is a <br />mosque<br />      near<br />          my<br />            home in<br />              Madurai where they say his head is buried. This area is<br />      called<br />            Samattipuram.<br />              This is a very volatile area for asking questions on<br />      religion,<br />            this is what<br />              has prevented me from doing so. This Marudhanayagam was<br />    also<br />      a<br />            convert and<br />              they say the British could not kill him. Every time <br />they<br />      thought<br />            they had<br />              killed him he came back! That is why the next time they<br />      killed<br />          him<br />            they<br />              separated his head from the body and buried them<br />    separately.<br />      I<br />            dont know<br />              where they buried his body.<br />              Can anybody elaborate on this?

			<div class="content">Dear Mr Venkatesh;<br /><br />From: your mail about Marudhanayagam I have presumed that he fought the<br />British between 1750 and 1780(correct me if i am wrong). If this is so then<br />how come we call the 1857 Mutiny of Sepoys as the First War of Independence.<br />Mangal Pandey was not even angry because they were ill treating Indians it<br />was because they had mislead him into chewing beef. Is this because<br />Marudhunayagam was not documented that well?<br />How many Tamils have fought the British before 1857? Can you please<br />elaborate on this?<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 2/22/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi all<br /> <br />  not only the person but the period must have been fantastic<br />  &#40; in the retrospective&#41;- not for guys living at that time<br /> <br />  a period when the line between a ruler and a robber was very thin. a<br />  period when lotsa of non royals became blue blooded ones.<br />  the poligar times is a fantastic political play ground in the<br />  history of tamilnadu.<br /> <br />  maruthu pandyar, umai thurai, kattaboman, thondaimans, the french<br />  and the british battling it out in the land and the sea&#40; sadras<br />  kalpakkam is famous for its anglo french naval battles&#41;<br />  regards<br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Mr Venkatesh;<br />   <br />    This is really a lot of information about Marudanayagam!!!<br />    What a fantastic character this man must have been.

He ran away from his home, took Service under a<br />      European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed, served<br />  under<br />      another European &#40;who educated him&#41;, went to the Nawab&#39;s court,<br />  rose<br />      rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and eventually, as<br />  has<br />      been seen, became Commandant of all the Company&#39;s sepoys. His<br />      executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report &#40;see<br />      below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and entitled &#39;A<br />      view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was republished in<br />      Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and Madura &#39;his whole<br />      administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />      unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were happily<br />      combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge from<br />      punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example shows<br />      that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or<br />  complexion.&#39;<br />     <br />     <br />      Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />      The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the country,<br />      renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very moderate<br />  sum<br />      of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of 1759 and<br />  began<br />      by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting avenues<br />  through<br />      their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they fled, or<br />      executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He went on<br />  to<br />      reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had sobered all<br />      the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even had the<br />      audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without the<br />  knowledge<br />      or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />  offered to<br />      lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven lakhs<br />  per<br />      annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was enraged at<br />  this,<br />      or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his<br />  masters--<br />      he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began to<br />  collect<br />      troops.<br />     <br />      He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />      In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him and he<br />  was<br />      besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all deserted<br />      him, but he held out until October 1764 with great energy and<br />  skill,<br />      renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--he is<br />  said<br />      to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly employed<br />      3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault with a<br />      loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed and<br />  wounded.<br />      At the end of that time little real progress against him had been<br />      made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded, but he<br />  was<br />      treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in charge of<br />  the<br />      French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles Campbell, who<br />      commanded the English among the besiegers. He was ignominiously<br />      hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of Madura, and<br />  his<br />      body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was afterwards<br />      erected over the tomb.

He ran away from his home, took Service under <br />a<br />        European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed, <br />served<br />    under<br />        another European &#40;who educated him&#41;, went to the Nawab&#39;s <br />court,<br />    rose<br />        rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and eventually, <br />as<br />    has<br />        been seen, became Commandant of all the Company&#39;s sepoys. His<br />        executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report <br />&#40;see<br />        below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and <br />entitled &#39;A<br />        view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was <br />republished in<br />        Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and Madura &#39;his <br />whole<br />        administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />        unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were happily<br />        combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge from<br />        punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example shows<br />        that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or<br />    complexion.&#39;<br />       <br />       <br />        Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />        The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the <br />country,<br />        renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very <br />moderate<br />    sum<br />        of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of 1759 and<br />    began<br />        by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting avenues<br />    through<br />        their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they fled, or<br />        executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He <br />went on<br />    to<br />        reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had <br />sobered all<br />        the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even <br />had the<br />        audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without the<br />    knowledge<br />        or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />    offered to<br />        lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven <br />lakhs<br />    per<br />        annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was enraged at<br />    this,<br />        or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his<br />    masters--<br />        he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began to<br />    collect<br />        troops.<br />       <br />        He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />        In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him and <br />he<br />    was<br />        besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all <br />deserted<br />        him, but he held out until October 1764 with great energy and<br />    skill,<br />        renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--he is<br />    said<br />        to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly <br />employed<br />        3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault <br />with a<br />        loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed and<br />    wounded.<br />        At the end of that time little real progress against him had <br />been<br />        made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded, <br />but he<br />    was<br />        treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in charge <br />of<br />    the<br />        French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles <br />Campbell, who<br />        commanded the English among the besiegers. He was <br />ignominiously<br />        hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of Madura, <br />and<br />    his<br />        body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was <br />afterwards<br />        erected over the tomb.

I mean to say if we are upset<br />with them for looting us for a mere 250 years..shouldn't we be more upset<br />with the Muslim rule which looted us for almost 800 years? If not, then why<br />this "fight agains the British" .. or are we just being politically correct<br />since we have a number of Indian Muslims (who quite rightly shouldn't be<br />held responsible for what some idiots from Afghanistan did a few centuries<br />ago).?<br /><br />.02 cents worth..<br /><br />AK<br /><br />On 2/25/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>kattabomman was hanged in 1799/ 1801<br />  maruthu pandyar in 1801 or something.<br /> <br />  except for vellore the entire tamil region must have been quiet<br />  during the mutiny.<br /> <br />  but dont worry about documentation.<br /> <br />  when did mangal pandey movie come? when did kattabomman movie come.<br />  we were 40 years ahead.<br />  but forget all this dcumentation business<br /> <br /> <br />  but if you keep patriotism from shading your concience you will<br />  learn that none of these guys were anti british from the start. both<br />  maruthu pandyar and kattabomman had paid their taxes to the nawab<br />  and the british regularly. some dispute in the middle caused their<br />  tiff.<br /> <br />  remember .<br />  india as an entity is post gandhi. thank him for it.<br /> <br />  we were literally ruled by a pack of lusty thieves&#40; sorry for the<br />  harsh language&#41; each a tyrant in a postage size princely state<br />  before the british came. and they made the british seem better.<br /> <br />  gandhi was banned from entering more of these princely states than<br />  british india.<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br />  --- In <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Dear Mr Venkatesh;<br />   <br />    From your mail about Marudhanayagam I have presumed that he fought<br />  the<br />    British between 1750 and 1780&#40;correct me if i am wrong&#41;.

He ran away from his home, took Service under<br />  a<br />          European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed,<br />  served<br />      under<br />          another European &#40;who educated him&#41;, went to the Nawab&#39;s<br />  court,<br />      rose<br />          rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and eventually,<br />  as<br />      has<br />          been seen, became Commandant of all the Company&#39;s sepoys. His<br />          executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report<br />  &#40;see<br />          below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />  entitled &#39;A<br />          view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was<br />  republished in<br />          Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and Madura &#39;his<br />  whole<br />          administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />          unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were happily<br />          combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge from<br />          punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example shows<br />          that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or<br />      complexion.&#39;<br />         <br />         <br />          Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />          The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the<br />  country,<br />          renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />  moderate<br />      sum<br />          of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of 1759 and<br />      began<br />          by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting avenues<br />      through<br />          their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they fled, or<br />          executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He<br />  went on<br />      to<br />          reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />  sobered all<br />          the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even<br />  had the<br />          audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without the<br />      knowledge<br />          or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />      offered to<br />          lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven<br />  lakhs<br />      per<br />          annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was enraged at<br />      this,<br />          or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his<br />      masters--<br />          he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began to<br />      collect<br />          troops.<br />         <br />          He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />          In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him and<br />  he<br />      was<br />          besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all<br />  deserted<br />          him, but he held out until October 1764 with great energy and<br />      skill,<br />          renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--he is<br />      said<br />          to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly<br />  employed<br />          3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault<br />  with a<br />          loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed and<br />      wounded.<br />          At the end of that time little real progress against him had<br />  been<br />          made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded,<br />  but he<br />      was<br />          treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in charge<br />  of<br />      the<br />          French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />  Campbell, who<br />          commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />  ignominiously<br />          hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of Madura,<br />  and<br />      his<br />          body was buried at the spot.

He ran away from his home, took Service <br />under<br />    a<br />            European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed,<br />    served<br />        under<br />            another European &#40;who educated him&#41;, went to the Nawab&#39;s<br />    court,<br />        rose<br />            rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and <br />eventually,<br />    as<br />        has<br />            been seen, became Commandant of all the Company&#39;s <br />sepoys. His<br />            executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report<br />    &#40;see<br />            below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />    entitled &#39;A<br />            view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was<br />    republished in<br />            Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and <br />Madura &#39;his<br />    whole<br />            administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />            unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were <br />happily<br />            combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge <br />from<br />            punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example <br />shows<br />            that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or<br />        complexion.&#39;<br />           <br />           <br />            Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />            The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the<br />    country,<br />            renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />    moderate<br />        sum<br />            of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of <br />1759 and<br />        began<br />            by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting <br />avenues<br />        through<br />            their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they <br />fled, or<br />            executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He<br />    went on<br />        to<br />            reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />    sobered all<br />            the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even<br />    had the<br />            audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without <br />the<br />        knowledge<br />            or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />        offered to<br />            lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven<br />    lakhs<br />        per<br />            annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was <br />enraged at<br />        this,<br />            or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his<br />        masters--<br />            he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began <br />to<br />        collect<br />            troops.<br />           <br />            He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />            In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him <br />and<br />    he<br />        was<br />            besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all<br />    deserted<br />            him, but he held out until October 1764 with great <br />energy and<br />        skill,<br />            renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--<br />he is<br />        said<br />            to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly<br />    employed<br />            3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault<br />    with a<br />            loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed <br />and<br />        wounded.<br />            At the end of that time little real progress against him <br />had<br />    been<br />            made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded,<br />    but he<br />        was<br />            treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in <br />charge<br />    of<br />        the<br />            French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />    Campbell, who<br />            commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />    ignominiously<br />            hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of <br />Madura,<br />    and<br />        his<br />            body was buried at the spot.

			<div class="content">Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br /><br />Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg to differ. I<br />think India still would have been a vibrant economy even without the<br />British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more time but it would certainly<br />have happened. There is always this attitude that without the British we<br />wouldn't have had the railways,command over the English<br />language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these things without the<br />British and we would have remained united. The British made sure when they<br />were leaving that this problem of religion and partition would haunt us for<br />ever.<br /><br />I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not rule India"<br />as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a culture which is as old as<br />ours changed for the better just because of a minuscule period ruled by the<br />British? Just because you are a superior nation it does not give you the<br />right to rule over the weak let alone take their lives. My clients in<br />England still treat this country as an English colony.<br /><br />What happened to us by the British is similar to what is happening to Iraq<br />by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has railways,proper government<br />systems would they be happy that the US came and conquered them? No! This<br />attitude is prevalent amongst us Indians,only! I remember reading in a<br />thread before "Indians are the ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their<br />past"<br /><br />Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that they think they<br />are superior the problem we think we are inferior"<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 2/25/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hear hear<br /> <br />  well said arun<br /> <br />  this is a hatred psychosis imposed on us by our politicians.<br />  hatred towards the brits were the unifying force for the freedom<br />  movement.<br /> <br />  we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till 1947.and<br />  lets realise its a costly payment.<br />  but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states<br />  fighting each other.<br />  thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    I have always felt this "anger" or even "hatred" towards the Brits<br />  that many<br />    Indians have as just a wee <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> irrational.

His justice was<br />              unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were<br />  happily<br />              combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge<br />  from<br />              punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example<br />  shows<br />              that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or<br />          complexion.&#39;<br />             <br />             <br />              Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />              The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the<br />      country,<br />              renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />      moderate<br />          sum<br />              of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of<br />  1759 and<br />          began<br />              by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />  avenues<br />          through<br />              their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they<br />  fled, or<br />              executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He<br />      went on<br />          to<br />              reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />      sobered all<br />              the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even<br />      had the<br />              audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without<br />  the<br />          knowledge<br />              or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />          offered to<br />              lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven<br />      lakhs<br />          per<br />              annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />  enraged at<br />          this,<br />              or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his<br />          masters--<br />              he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began<br />  to<br />          collect<br />              troops.<br />             <br />              He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />              In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him<br />  and<br />      he<br />          was<br />              besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all<br />      deserted<br />              him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />  energy and<br />          skill,<br />              renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--<br />  he is<br />          said<br />              to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly<br />      employed<br />              3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault<br />      with a<br />              loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed<br />  and<br />          wounded.<br />              At the end of that time little real progress against him<br />  had<br />      been<br />              made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded,<br />      but he<br />          was<br />              treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in<br />  charge<br />      of<br />          the<br />              French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />      Campbell, who<br />              commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />      ignominiously<br />              hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of<br />  Madura,<br />      and<br />          his<br />              body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was<br />      afterwards<br />              erected over the tomb.

			<div class="content">Dear Rahul and Natarajan,<br /><br />I believe you both didn't get where I am coming from. My point was NOT that<br />British rule was good for us. Quite the contrary. They looted us to the tune<br />of more than a trillion dollars apparently. I was just trying to contrast<br />the "hatred" instilled in us from childhood for the Brits as compared to the<br />veneration for the other invaders like Babur and Sher Shah Suri etc. I was<br />trying to raise a point as to why the one group were villified by our<br />educators while the other group was almost deified. If you look at actual<br />loot, rape and plunder, the Muslim conquest was horrible for India. In fact,<br />I would go so far as to say that in a way the British conquest hastened the<br />end of the Muslim rule in India... not a bad thing at all was it?<br /><br />Moreover, over 800 years of Muslim rule there was no headway made in science<br />or technology (except for the introduction of cannons in India by Babur).<br />Apart from that.. zero, nada, zip, zilch. Which is why I raised the<br />question.. why was it a fight against British rule, but NOT a fight against<br />Muslim rule? The answer is pretty self evident.. with 150 million Muslims,<br />no one would dare to tell the truth in that regards.. <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Hope I have clarified my position.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />AK<br /><br />On 2/26/06, NATARAJAN SRINIVASAN  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi all,<br /> <br />  I go with Mr. Rahul.
