			<div class="content">Vairam, I am sure you know, perhaps just forgotten so<br />I will repeat what i know sitravukku therindadu.<br /><br />Kongu ther vazhkai is the seyyul stated by Lord Siva<br />(supposedly) as an answer to the pandiya king's query<br />on women's hair being fragrant naturally or not. I<br />know it is sangam poetry supposedly written by Lord<br />Shiva himself and as I remember it goes<br /><br />Kongu Ther Vazhkai anjirai thumbi<br />kamam sepaadhu kandadhu mozhimo<br />payiliyadhu keliya natpin mayilal seri ayitru<br />arivai koondhalin nariyavum ulavo<br />nee ariyum poove<br /><br />In two lines 'hey bee have you seen any flower more<br />fragrant than this woman's hair'.<br /><br />It is very good to know Avvai and Valluvar did not<br />live in same time. I remember my tamil teacher telling<br />me that we do not even know their gender to be male or<br />female although VAlluvar is probably male based on his<br />references to women in kural.<br />My dear mother who is no more was so offended when I<br />mentioned Avvai may not be female as it contradicted<br />her mental image of the immortal singer KB Sundarambal<br />as Avvai!:)) So the potramarai/thirukkural story is<br />also a legend...although I still get goose pimples to<br />hear KBS's voice sing 'endrum udaya thamizhe kural<br />etru kolla varuga' <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- Vairam  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi,<br />  sorry for my ignorance...if you give more<br />  information on &#39;Kongu ther<br />  vazhkai&#39; I will try to find it out.<br />  Sorry once more about my ignorance , i dont know<br />  about the<br />  Thriukural legend too.<br /> <br />  When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i dont<br />  see any period<br />  where they would have lived together. Though Tamil<br />  Nadu government has<br />  gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born thirty<br />  years before chirst,<br />  all literary scholars and historians date Thirukural<br />  any where between<br />  5th to 10th century. The most closest dating would<br />  be around the 5-6th<br />  century&#40;didactic age&#41;.<br />  Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The poet<br />  in Sangam<br />  literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many other<br />  poems might be<br />  different form Avvaiyars of Later periods. Avvaiyar<br />  and Agastya are<br />  the two most common people whose name has been<br />  linked to every other<br />  work.&#40;Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />  work around 14th<br />  century&#41;. I have not come across any critical study<br />  specific to<br />  Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />  Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />  in Tamil poetry.<br />  The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru is<br />  different from<br />  Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar Agaporul.<br />  If you ask<br />  question how can you find that?...its not easy for<br />  us...but literary<br />  scholars and linguist have specific methods.... with<br />  each century the<br />  language attains some changes, so the compare the<br />  poems of the Two<br />  Nakkirars in question. The check the style, language<br />  usage,allusions<br />  employed etc. if its close enough and if the dating<br />  of two works are<br />  close enough they accept it as a single author. But<br />  if there is<br />  drastic change in usage of language , if there are<br />  loan words which<br />  cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they come<br />  to conclusion that<br />  they are work of two different poets....&#40;only<br />  manirathanam can take a<br />  manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his name<br />  to Manirathanam<br />  and directs a movie...people can surely recogonise<br />  that its surely not<br />  Manirathanams movie!&#41;<br /> <br />  So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />  Avvaiyar did not live in<br />  period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2<br />  centuries after<br />  Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.<br /> <br />  Probably the base to such legend would have been the<br />  Saiva,Jain<br />  ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />  threw some poetry on<br />  palm leaves into the river...to see which one came<br />  back to shore and<br />  which left to prove the religions supremacy...<br /> <br />  Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />  across any critical<br />  study I will surely post it here!<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Vairam<br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />  Mahadevan <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Vairam, who was the real author of &#39;kongu ther<br />    vazhkai&#39;?

			<div class="content">Vairam - what you say is true... to some extent. <br />I am yet to see a religion that preaches violence.

Avvaiyar had a peculiar<br />characteristics...she actually did some thing like present day<br />lyricist.... she actually wrte the lyrics and make others to<br />sing..like a drummer, dancer.... this make historians get confused!!!!<br />I still remember about a song where Dr. Zvelebil comments Avviyar must<br />have drummed during th song, Dr.Hart in his book would have critised<br />Dr.Zvelebil's observation and said the dummer would have sung song of<br />Avvaiyar.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Vairam<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam, I am sure you know, perhaps just forgotten so<br />  I will repeat what i know sitravukku therindadu.<br />  <br />  Kongu ther vazhkai is the seyyul stated by Lord Siva<br />  &#40;supposedly&#41; as an answer to the pandiya king&#39;s query<br />  on women&#39;s hair being fragrant naturally or not.

Though Tamil<br />    Nadu government has<br />    gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born thirty<br />    years before chirst,<br />    all literary scholars and historians date Thirukural<br />    any where between<br />    5th to 10th century. The most closest dating would<br />    be around the 5-6th<br />    century&#40;didactic age&#41;.<br />    Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The poet<br />    in Sangam<br />    literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many other<br />    poems might be<br />    different form Avvaiyars of Later periods. Avvaiyar<br />    and Agastya are<br />    the two most common people whose name has been<br />    linked to every other<br />    work.&#40;Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />    work around 14th<br />    century&#41;. I have not come across any critical study<br />    specific to<br />    Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />    Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />    in Tamil poetry.<br />    The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru is<br />    different from<br />    Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar Agaporul.<br />    If you ask<br />    question how can you find that?...its not easy for<br />    us...but literary<br />    scholars and linguist have specific methods.... with<br />    each century the<br />    language attains some changes, so the compare the<br />    poems of the Two<br />    Nakkirars in question. The check the style, language<br />    usage,allusions<br />    employed etc. if its close enough and if the dating<br />    of two works are<br />    close enough they accept it as a single author. But<br />    if there is<br />    drastic change in usage of language , if there are<br />    loan words which<br />    cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they come<br />    to conclusion that<br />    they are work of two different poets....&#40;only<br />    manirathanam can take a<br />    manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his name<br />    to Manirathanam<br />    and directs a movie...people can surely recogonise<br />    that its surely not<br />    Manirathanams movie!&#41;<br />    <br />    So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />    Avvaiyar did not live in<br />    period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2<br />    centuries after<br />    Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.<br />    <br />    Probably the base to such legend would have been the<br />    Saiva,Jain<br />    ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />    threw some poetry on<br />    palm leaves into the river...to see which one came<br />    back to shore and<br />    which left to prove the religions supremacy...<br />    <br />    Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />    across any critical<br />    study I will surely post it here!<br />     <br />    Regards,<br />    Vairam<br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />    Mahadevan <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      Vairam, who was the real author of &#39;kongu ther<br />      vazhkai&#39;?

To me I&#39;d rather<br />      say it was something people had to do in those times<br />      when society was not as evolved and leave it at<br />      that.Undoubtedly though reduced my respect for<br />      Mahendra Pallava.<br />      <br />      Malathi <br />      <br />      <br />      --- "Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote: <br />      <br />        <br />          <br />          Probably the base to such legend would have been<br />        the Saiva,Jain<br />          ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />        threw some poetry <br />        on<br />          palm leaves into the river...to see which one<br />        came back to shore and<br />          which left to prove the religions supremacy...<br />        <br />        Hi vairam<br />        <br />        The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in<br />        front of mahendra <br />        pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on<br />        water but a test of <br />        fire..<br />        <br />        This happens after appar&#39;s reconversion back &#40; born<br />        as marul <br />        neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then<br />        into the shivaite <br />        faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar<br />        by gyana <br />        sambandar&#41; - the king himself into the jain faith,<br />        was goaded by the <br />        jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain<br />        monk embracing <br />        shivism...led the king to subject appar to many<br />        tortures - incl being <br />        confined into a cell for a week without food or<br />        water, being poisoned, <br />        trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then<br />        finally being tied <br />        to a stone and dropped into the sea....&#40; dont want<br />        to take the <br />        comparison to the dasavataram again&#41;....appar<br />        emerged unscathed which <br />        sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of<br />        these episodes are <br />        beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar &#40; its not<br />        for nothing that he <br />        is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue&#41;<br />        <br />        <br />        inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was<br />        stronger mahendra <br />        engaged appar with a debate with the jain<br />        monks...both argued for long <br />        without any clear winner emerging...finally they<br />        agreed to a <br />        test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and<br />        threw it into a <br />        fire....appar&#39;s emerged unscathed but the jain work<br />        perished...this <br />        made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not<br />        much publisised but <br />        has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out<br />        the jain faith in <br />        tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes<br />        &#40; kazuvil <br />        ettruthal&#41;, mass murder - leaving their bodies to be<br />        consumed by dogs <br />        and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king<br />        also destroyed a <br />        large number of jain schools and places of worship <br />        <br />        this is a very significant and turning point in<br />        tamil land, if not for <br />        this - i would have had to sign off as vijay<br />        jain....<br />        <br />        rgds<br />        vj</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">The avaiyar of sangam period's words have so much difference in <br />avaiyar of Sundarar time.<br /><br />Look at the words of aram seya virumbu to setha kilapu senthamarayum <br />(vinayakar agaval - detailed kundalini hymn with the agaram), they <br />talk about two different era's of people mind set. Infact the spell <br />of sangam and the thirukural and simple notes of that period on <br />Avvai - point to a society in turmoil, i mean society needing to go <br />back to the 'basics', sangam bards composing of barer system and <br />model of life, specifically pre pallava and post 1st gen cholas.<br />Now look at the lits of Sundarar, Avvai (same time period) etc how <br />society has changed, what is wanted at the sangam age and what is <br />needed at the age of sundarar etc.<br /><br />Going further down, the largest literacy work after the alwar - nayan <br />mar time is thirupugazh (1400 ad) with 16000 songs (1322 found) and <br />the works are amazingly construed from both sangam and each monarch <br />time. <br /><br />The time of people writing poetry plays a very important role in the <br />poet's expressions and mind also.<br /><br />-- R<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Malathi,<br />  Shiva -Sivaji<br />  Tharumi - Nagesh<br />  Avvaiyar - K P Sundramabal<br />  Agathiyrar- Sirgali<br />  Murugan - Shiva kumar <br />  Krishna,Rama - NTR<br />  wat ever true history we find...ppl cant erase these faces out of<br />  their mind....power of Cinema!!!!!<br />  <br />  Some interesting <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of news about Avvaiyar.... all poets during<br />  Sangam were singing poets or Bards....

I remember my tamil teacher telling<br />    me that we do not even know their gender to be male or<br />    female although VAlluvar is probably male based on his<br />    references to women in kural. <br />    My dear mother who is no more was so offended when I<br />    mentioned Avvai may not be female as it contradicted<br />    her mental image of the immortal singer KB Sundarambal<br />    as Avvai!:&#41;&#41; So the potramarai/thirukkural story is<br />    also a legend...although I still get goose pimples to<br />    hear KBS&#39;s voice sing &#39;endrum udaya thamizhe kural<br />    etru kolla varuga&#39; <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />    <br />    Malathi<br />    <br />    --- Vairam  wrote: <br />    <br />      Hi,<br />      sorry for my ignorance...if you give more<br />      information on &#39;Kongu ther<br />      vazhkai&#39; I will try to find it out.<br />      Sorry once more about my ignorance , i dont know<br />      about the<br />      Thriukural legend too.<br />      <br />      When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i dont<br />      see any period<br />      where they would have lived together. Though Tamil<br />      Nadu government has<br />      gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born thirty<br />      years before chirst,<br />      all literary scholars and historians date Thirukural<br />      any where between<br />      5th to 10th century. The most closest dating would<br />      be around the 5-6th<br />      century&#40;didactic age&#41;.<br />      Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The poet<br />      in Sangam<br />      literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many other<br />      poems might be<br />      different form Avvaiyars of Later periods. Avvaiyar<br />      and Agastya are<br />      the two most common people whose name has been<br />      linked to every other<br />      work.&#40;Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />      work around 14th<br />      century&#41;. I have not come across any critical study<br />      specific to<br />      Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />      Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />      in Tamil poetry.<br />      The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru is<br />      different from<br />      Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar Agaporul.<br />      If you ask<br />      question how can you find that?...its not easy for<br />      us...but literary<br />      scholars and linguist have specific methods.... with<br />      each century the<br />      language attains some changes, so the compare the<br />      poems of the Two<br />      Nakkirars in question. The check the style, language<br />      usage,allusions<br />      employed etc. if its close enough and if the dating<br />      of two works are<br />      close enough they accept it as a single author. But<br />      if there is<br />      drastic change in usage of language , if there are<br />      loan words which<br />      cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they come<br />      to conclusion that<br />      they are work of two different poets....&#40;only<br />      manirathanam can take a<br />      manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his name<br />      to Manirathanam<br />      and directs a movie...people can surely recogonise<br />      that its surely not<br />      Manirathanams movie!&#41;<br />      <br />      So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />      Avvaiyar did not live in<br />      period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2<br />      centuries after<br />      Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.<br />      <br />      Probably the base to such legend would have been the<br />      Saiva,Jain<br />      ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />      threw some poetry on<br />      palm leaves into the river...to see which one came<br />      back to shore and<br />      which left to prove the religions supremacy...<br />      <br />      Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />      across any critical<br />      study I will surely post it here!<br />       <br />      Regards,<br />      Vairam<br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />      Mahadevan <br />      wrote: <br />       <br />        Vairam, who was the real author of &#39;kongu ther<br />        vazhkai&#39;?

			<div class="content">Yeah, to me it is like this. Any mass philosophy will<br />have its pit falls, whether it is mass religion or<br />mass athiesm or mass anything. A group of people put<br />together in a room, one will be leader other his<br />enemy, they will form gangs and fight. It is the<br />nature of human mind. Even Zen religon has had its<br />politicians, why hinduism or buddhism or islam.<br />Scientists have their politics too beleive it or not,<br />gang wars and his theory versus mine happens in<br />university halls all the time.<br /><br />To me faith is something to be kept in private.<br />Whether i need to be Taoist or an idol worshipping<br />hindu depends on my background, what life has dealt my<br />way, and what makes sense to me to deal with life's<br />tribulations.

Most often the next levels of functionaries or the <br />subsequent followers totally mis interpret the original teachings. <br />Its the case even with buddhism. <br /><br />So unless, we have the original teachings ( sadly they dont exist) <br />or peel away the later additions to look at the core, you dont <br />understand what was originaly said.<br /><br />the second - more important - is we need to be aware of the short <br />comings of any event - its no longer wise to just cover up and <br />pretend that nothing happened. By reading what exactly transpired we <br />are wiser - and hopefully think twice before repeating past mistakes <br />( unfortunately todays politicians use the same tool in reverse - <br />rake up old wounds to fester rather than see the cause and heal)<br /><br />rgds<br />vj</div>

			<div class="content">Vairam, really very interesting...to think we don't<br />have female lyricists at all in tamil movies till<br />now:))<br /><br />AVM's Avvaiyyar really was a very well made movie,<br />mostly musical which of course was hated by later day<br />generations (the last time I saw it (Kamadhenu theatre<br />I think) they closed the show mid way due to audience<br />cat calls). They show Paari Vallal also as having<br />lived in same time as Avvai, and Avvai gets his two<br />daughters married to a king of Thirukovilur,<br />Theiveegan.

I remember my tamil teacher<br />  telling<br />    me that we do not even know their gender to be<br />  male or<br />    female although VAlluvar is probably male based on<br />  his<br />    references to women in kural.<br />    My dear mother who is no more was so offended when<br />  I<br />    mentioned Avvai may not be female as it<br />  contradicted<br />    her mental image of the immortal singer KB<br />  Sundarambal<br />    as Avvai!:&#41;&#41; So the potramarai/thirukkural story<br />  is<br />    also a legend...although I still get goose pimples<br />  to<br />    hear KBS&#39;s voice sing &#39;endrum udaya thamizhe kural<br />    etru kolla varuga&#39; <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />   <br />    Malathi<br />   <br />    --- Vairam  wrote: <br />   <br />      Hi,<br />      sorry for my ignorance...if you give more<br />      information on &#39;Kongu ther<br />      vazhkai&#39; I will try to find it out.<br />      Sorry once more about my ignorance , i dont<br />  know<br />      about the<br />      Thriukural legend too.<br />     <br />      When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i<br />  dont<br />      see any period<br />      where they would have lived together. Though<br />  Tamil<br />      Nadu government has<br />      gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born<br />  thirty<br />      years before chirst,<br />      all literary scholars and historians date<br />  Thirukural<br />      any where between<br />      5th to 10th century. The most closest dating<br />  would<br />      be around the 5-6th<br />      century&#40;didactic age&#41;.<br />      Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The<br />  poet<br />      in Sangam<br />      literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many<br />  other<br />      poems might be<br />      different form Avvaiyars of Later periods.<br />  Avvaiyar<br />      and Agastya are<br />      the two most common people whose name has been<br />      linked to every other<br />      work.&#40;Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />      work around 14th<br />      century&#41;. I have not come across any critical<br />  study<br />      specific to<br />      Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />      Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />      in Tamil poetry.<br />      The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru<br />  is<br />      different from<br />      Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar<br />  Agaporul.<br />      If you ask<br />      question how can you find that?...its not easy<br />  for<br />      us...but literary<br />      scholars and linguist have specific methods....<br />  with<br />      each century the<br />      language attains some changes, so the compare<br />  the<br />      poems of the Two<br />      Nakkirars in question. The check the style,<br />  language<br />      usage,allusions<br />      employed etc. if its close enough and if the<br />  dating<br />      of two works are<br />      close enough they accept it as a single author.<br />  But<br />      if there is<br />      drastic change in usage of language , if there<br />  are<br />      loan words which<br />      cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they<br />  come<br />      to conclusion that<br />      they are work of two different poets....&#40;only<br />      manirathanam can take a<br />      manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his<br />  name<br />      to Manirathanam<br />      and directs a movie...people can surely<br />  recogonise<br />      that its surely not<br />      Manirathanams movie!&#41;<br />     <br />      So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />      Avvaiyar did not live in<br />      period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was<br />  atleast 2<br />      centuries after<br />      Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.<br />     <br />      Probably the base to such legend would have been<br />  the<br />      Saiva,Jain<br />      ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like<br />  Appar<br />      threw some poetry on<br />      palm leaves into the river...to see which one<br />  came<br />      back to shore and<br />      which left to prove the religions supremacy...<br />     <br />      Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />      across any critical<br />      study I will surely post it here!<br />     <br />      Regards,<br />      Vairam<br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />      Mahadevan <br />      wrote: <br />       <br />        Vairam, who was the real author of &#39;kongu ther<br />        vazhkai&#39;?
