			<div class="content">British... vandhaargaL.... venRaargaL..romba naaL kaziththu senRaargaL. avvaLavuthaan.<br /><br />There was a say in African countries now a days. When Europian landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and wealth was with black. After some time it was reverse.<br /><br />In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them to conquer their 'enemies' portion. It happened not only in Tamil speaking 'nations' but also other areas including Andhra and Bengal. Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms during 19th century in the so called vengi (present east and west godavari districts) and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas of Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />(Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms)There were so many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice their lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not like northern areas of Tamilnadu.<br /><br />One way we can treat British as 'saviours' but at the same time we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised ruler like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing eatable to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet during British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kuloththungha but when chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at the temples of more than 800 years old only.<br /><br />But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without the so called help of British we would have had all the modern facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries. There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas (highways), there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with the words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as they wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and trains led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea, cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)<br /><br />Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British also to that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war against British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his knowledge towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about the future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha sudhanthiram adainthu...<br /><br />Dhivakar<br /><br />Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br />Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br /><br />Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg to differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy even without the British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more time but it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude that without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command over the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these things without the British and we would have remained united. The British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of religion and partition would haunt us for ever.<br /><br />I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a culture which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the weak let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat this country as an English colony.<br /><br />What happened to us by the British is similar to what is happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the US came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst us Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians are the ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past"<br /><br />Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that they think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 2/25/06, R.venketesh  wrote: hear hear<br /><br />well said arun<br /><br />this is a hatred psychosis imposed on us by our politicians.<br />hatred towards the brits were the unifying force for the freedom<br />movement.<br /><br />we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till 1947.and<br />lets realise its a costly payment.<br />but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states<br />fighting each other.<br />thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I have always felt this "anger" or even "hatred" towards the Brits<br />that many<br />  Indians have as just a wee <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> irrational.

His justice was<br />            unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were<br />happily<br />            combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge<br />from<br />            punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example<br />shows<br />            that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or<br />        complexion.&#39;<br />           <br />           <br />            Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />            The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the<br />    country,<br />            renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />    moderate<br />        sum<br />            of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of<br />1759 and<br />        began<br />            by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />avenues<br />        through<br />            their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they<br />fled, or<br />            executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He<br />    went on<br />        to<br />            reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />    sobered all<br />            the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even<br />    had the<br />            audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without<br />the<br />        knowledge<br />            or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />        offered to<br />            lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven<br />    lakhs<br />        per<br />            annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />enraged at<br />        this,<br />            or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his<br />        masters--<br />            he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began<br />to<br />        collect<br />            troops.<br />           <br />            He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />            In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him<br />and<br />    he<br />        was<br />            besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all<br />    deserted<br />            him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />energy and<br />        skill,<br />            renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--<br />he is<br />        said<br />            to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly<br />    employed<br />            3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault<br />    with a<br />            loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed<br />and<br />        wounded.<br />            At the end of that time little real progress against him<br />had<br />    been<br />            made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded,<br />    but he<br />        was<br />            treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in<br />charge<br />    of<br />        the<br />            French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />    Campbell, who<br />            commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />    ignominiously<br />            hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of<br />Madura,<br />    and<br />        his<br />            body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was<br />    afterwards<br />            erected over the tomb.

I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not like <br />northern areas of Tamilnadu. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>One way we can treat British as &#39;saviours&#39; but at the same time <br />we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised ruler</div></blockquote>like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing eatable <br />to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet during <br />British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had <br />prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kuloththungha but when <br />chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at the <br />temples of more than 800 years old only.  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without <br />the so called help of British we would have had all the modern</div></blockquote>facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries. <br />There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a <br />sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar <br />that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas (highways), <br />there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with the <br />words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as they <br />wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and trains <br />led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea, <br />cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but <br />when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all</div></blockquote>seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British also to <br />that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war against <br />British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his knowledge <br />towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about the <br />future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of <br />that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha <br />sudhanthiram adainthu...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dhivakar<br />  <br />  Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br />  Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br />     <br />  Thanks for your mail.

Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more time but <br />it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude that <br />without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command over <br />the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these <br />things without the British and we would have remained united. The <br />British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of <br />religion and partition would haunt us for ever. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not <br />rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a culture</div></blockquote>which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a <br />minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a <br />superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the weak <br />let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat this <br />country as an English colony. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>What happened to us by the British is similar to what is <br />happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has</div></blockquote>railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the US <br />came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst us <br />Indians,only!

His<br />              executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the <br />report <br />      &#40;see<br />              below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />      entitled &#39;A<br />              view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was<br />      republished in <br />              Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and <br />  Madura &#39;his<br />      whole<br />              administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice <br />was<br />              unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were <br />  happily<br />              combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge <br />  from<br />              punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example <br />  shows<br />              that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate <br />or <br />          complexion.&#39;<br />             <br />             <br />              Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />              The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to <br />the <br />      country,<br />              renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />      moderate<br />          sum<br />              of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of <br />  1759 and<br />          began<br />              by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting <br />  avenues<br />          through<br />              their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they <br />  fled, or<br />              executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. <br />He<br />      went on<br />          to<br />              reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had <br />      sobered all<br />              the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He <br />even<br />      had the<br />              audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without <br />  the<br />          knowledge<br />              or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, <br />he<br />          offered to<br />              lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at <br />seven <br />      lakhs<br />          per<br />              annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was <br />  enraged at<br />          this,<br />              or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy <br />his <br />          masters--<br />              he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and <br />began <br />  to<br />          collect<br />              troops.<br />              <br />              He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />              In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against <br />him <br />  and<br />      he<br />          was<br />              besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly <br />all <br />      deserted<br />              him, but he held out until October 1764 with great <br />  energy and<br />          skill,<br />              renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense-<br />- <br />  he is<br />          said<br />              to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and <br />constantly<br />      employed<br />              3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief <br />assault <br />      with a<br />              loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed <br />  and<br />          wounded.<br />              At the end of that time little real progress against <br />him <br />  had<br />      been<br />              made, except that the place was now rigorously <br />blockaded,<br />      but he<br />          was<br />              treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in <br />  charge<br />      of<br />          the<br />              French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />      Campbell, who<br />              commanded the English among the besiegers.

			<div class="content">I disagree there Venketesh.. All said and done we were not White and hence<br />the Brits would not have wasted their resources making us as "developed" as<br />australia or new zealand.

When Europian<br />  landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and wealth<br />  was with black. After some time it was reverse.<br />   <br />      In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous<br />  rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them to<br />  conquer their &#39;enemies&#39; portion. It happened not only in Tamil<br />  speaking &#39;nations&#39; but also other areas including Andhra and Bengal.<br />  Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms<br />  during 19th century in the so called vengi &#40;present east and west<br />  godavari districts&#41; and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas of<br />  Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />    &#40;Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms&#41;There were so<br />  many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice their<br />  lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by<br />  rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not like<br />  northern areas of Tamilnadu.<br />   <br />      One way we can treat British as &#39;saviours&#39; but at the same time<br />  we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised ruler<br />  like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing eatable<br />  to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet during<br />  British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had<br />  prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kuloththungha but when<br />  chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at the<br />  temples of more than 800 years old only.<br />   <br />      But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without<br />  the so called help of British we would have had all the modern<br />  facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries.<br />  There was a joke in London &#40;May be Sri knows that&#41; while riding a<br />  sardar&#39;s taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar<br />  that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas &#40;highways&#41;,<br />  there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with the<br />  words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as they<br />  wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and trains<br />  led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London &#40;Tea,<br />  cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too&#41;<br />   <br />      Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but<br />  when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all<br />  seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British also to<br />  that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war against<br />  British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his knowledge<br />  towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about the<br />  future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of<br />  that feeling and sang &#39;aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />  sudhanthiram adainthu...<br />   <br />      Dhivakar<br />   <br />    Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br />        Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br />   <br />      Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg to<br />  differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy even<br />  without the British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more time but<br />  it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude that<br />  without the British we wouldn&#39;t have had the railways,command over<br />  the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these<br />  things without the British and we would have remained united. The<br />  British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />  religion and partition would haunt us for ever.<br />   <br />      I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not<br />  rule India" as this is purely  hypothetical. Do you think a culture<br />  which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a<br />  minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />  superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the weak<br />  let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat this<br />  country as an English colony.<br />   <br />      What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />  happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />  railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the US<br />  came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst us<br />  Indians,only!

This says that in Tinnevelly and<br />    Madura &#39;his<br />        whole<br />                administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice<br />  was<br />                unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were<br />    happily<br />                combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge<br />    from<br />                punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example<br />    shows<br />                that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate<br />  or<br />            complexion.&#39;<br />               <br />               <br />                Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />                The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to<br />  the<br />        country,<br />                renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />        moderate<br />            sum<br />                of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of<br />    1759 and<br />            began<br />                by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />    avenues<br />            through<br />                their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they<br />    fled, or<br />                executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners.<br />  He<br />        went on<br />            to<br />                reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />        sobered all<br />                the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He<br />  even<br />        had the<br />                audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without<br />    the<br />            knowledge<br />                or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762,<br />  he<br />            offered to<br />                lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at<br />  seven<br />        lakhs<br />            per<br />                annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />    enraged at<br />            this,<br />                or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy<br />  his<br />            masters--<br />                he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and<br />  began<br />    to<br />            collect<br />                troops.<br />               <br />                He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />                In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against<br />  him<br />    and<br />        he<br />            was<br />                besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly<br />  all<br />        deserted<br />                him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />    energy and<br />            skill,<br />                renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense-<br />  -<br />    he is<br />            said<br />                to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and<br />  constantly<br />        employed<br />                3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief<br />  assault<br />        with a<br />                loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed<br />    and<br />            wounded.<br />                At the end of that time little real progress against<br />  him<br />    had<br />        been<br />                made, except that the place was now rigorously<br />  blockaded,<br />        but he<br />            was<br />                treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in<br />    charge<br />        of<br />            the<br />                French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />        Campbell, who<br />                commanded the English among the besiegers.

When <br />Europian<br />    landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and <br />wealth<br />    was with black. After some time it was reverse.<br />     <br />      In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous<br />    rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them <br />to<br />    conquer their &#39;enemies&#39; portion. It happened not only in Tamil<br />    speaking &#39;nations&#39; but also other areas including Andhra and <br />Bengal.<br />    Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms<br />    during 19th century in the so called vengi &#40;present east and west<br />    godavari districts&#41; and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas <br />of<br />    Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />      &#40;Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms&#41;There were so<br />    many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice <br />their<br />    lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by<br />    rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not <br />like<br />    northern areas of Tamilnadu.<br />     <br />      One way we can treat British as &#39;saviours&#39; but at the same <br />time<br />    we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised <br />ruler<br />    like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing <br />eatable<br />    to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet <br />during<br />    British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had<br />    prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kuloththungha but when<br />    chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at <br />the<br />    temples of more than 800 years old only.<br />     <br />      But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without<br />    the so called help of British we would have had all the modern<br />    facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries.<br />    There was a joke in London &#40;May be Sri knows that&#41; while riding a<br />    sardar&#39;s taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar<br />    that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas <br />&#40;highways&#41;,<br />    there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with <br />the<br />    words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as <br />they<br />    wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and <br />trains<br />    led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London &#40;Tea,<br />    cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too&#41;<br />     <br />      Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but<br />    when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all<br />    seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British <br />also to<br />    that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war <br />against<br />    British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his <br />knowledge<br />    towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about <br />the<br />    future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of<br />    that feeling and sang &#39;aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />    sudhanthiram adainthu...<br />     <br />      Dhivakar<br />     <br />      Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br />      Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br />     <br />      Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg <br />to<br />    differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy <br />even<br />    without the British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more time <br />but<br />    it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude <br />that<br />    without the British we wouldn&#39;t have had the railways,command <br />over<br />    the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these<br />    things without the British and we would have remained united. The<br />    British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />    religion and partition would haunt us for ever.<br />     <br />      I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did <br />not<br />    rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a <br />culture<br />    which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a<br />    minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />    superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the <br />weak<br />    let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat <br />this<br />    country as an English colony.<br />     <br />      What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />    happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />    railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the <br />US<br />    came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst <br />us<br />    Indians,only!

After some time it was reverse.<br />       <br />          In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous<br />      rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them<br />  to<br />      conquer their &#39;enemies&#39; portion. It happened not only in Tamil<br />      speaking &#39;nations&#39; but also other areas including Andhra and<br />  Bengal.<br />      Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms<br />      during 19th century in the so called vengi &#40;present east and west<br />      godavari districts&#41; and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas<br />  of<br />      Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />        &#40;Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms&#41;There were so<br />      many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice<br />  their<br />      lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by<br />      rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not<br />  like<br />      northern areas of Tamilnadu.<br />       <br />          One way we can treat British as &#39;saviours&#39; but at the same<br />  time<br />      we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised<br />  ruler<br />      like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing<br />  eatable<br />      to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet<br />  during<br />      British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had<br />      prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kuloththungha but when<br />      chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at<br />  the<br />      temples of more than 800 years old only.<br />       <br />          But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without<br />      the so called help of British we would have had all the modern<br />      facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries.<br />      There was a joke in London &#40;May be Sri knows that&#41; while riding a<br />      sardar&#39;s taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar<br />      that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas<br />  &#40;highways&#41;,<br />      there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with<br />  the<br />      words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as<br />  they<br />      wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and<br />  trains<br />      led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London &#40;Tea,<br />      cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too&#41;<br />       <br />          Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but<br />      when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all<br />      seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British<br />  also to<br />      that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war<br />  against<br />      British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his<br />  knowledge<br />      towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about<br />  the<br />      future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of<br />      that feeling and sang &#39;aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />      sudhanthiram adainthu...<br />       <br />          Dhivakar<br />       <br />        Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br />            Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br />       <br />          Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg<br />  to<br />      differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy<br />  even<br />      without the British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more time<br />  but<br />      it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude<br />  that<br />      without the British we wouldn&#39;t have had the railways,command<br />  over<br />      the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these<br />      things without the British and we would have remained united. The<br />      British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />      religion and partition would haunt us for ever.<br />       <br />          I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did<br />  not<br />      rule India" as this is purely  hypothetical. Do you think a<br />  culture<br />      which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a<br />      minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />      superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the<br />  weak<br />      let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat<br />  this<br />      country as an English colony.<br />       <br />          What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />      happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />      railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the<br />  US<br />      came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst<br />  us<br />      Indians,only!

When<br />    Europian<br />        landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and<br />    wealth<br />        was with black. After some time it was reverse.<br />         <br />          In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called <br />numerous<br />        rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed <br />them<br />    to<br />        conquer their &#39;enemies&#39; portion. It happened not only in <br />Tamil<br />        speaking &#39;nations&#39; but also other areas including Andhra and<br />    Bengal.<br />        Do any one know that there were twenty two independent <br />kingdoms<br />        during 19th century in the so called vengi &#40;present east and <br />west<br />        godavari districts&#41; and south Kalingas? Even to day the <br />raajaas<br />    of<br />        Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />          &#40;Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms&#41;There <br />were so<br />        many situatuions that led to their darling queens to <br />sacrifice<br />    their<br />        lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them <br />by<br />        rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not<br />    like<br />        northern areas of Tamilnadu.<br />         <br />          One way we can treat British as &#39;saviours&#39; but at the <br />same<br />    time<br />        we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised<br />    ruler<br />        like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing<br />    eatable<br />        to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet<br />    during<br />        British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we <br />had<br />        prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kuloththungha but <br />when<br />        chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying <br />at<br />    the<br />        temples of more than 800 years old only.<br />         <br />          But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even <br />without<br />        the so called help of British we would have had all the <br />modern<br />        facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African <br />countries.<br />        There was a joke in London &#40;May be Sri knows that&#41; while <br />riding a<br />        sardar&#39;s taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian <br />sardar<br />        that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas<br />    &#40;highways&#41;,<br />        there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back <br />with<br />    the<br />        words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as<br />    they<br />        wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and<br />    trains<br />        led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London <br />&#40;Tea,<br />        cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too&#41;<br />         <br />          Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each <br />other but<br />        when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have <br />all<br />        seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British<br />    also to<br />        that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war<br />    against<br />        British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his<br />    knowledge<br />        towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi <br />about<br />    the<br />        future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the <br />insight of<br />        that feeling and sang &#39;aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />        sudhanthiram adainthu...<br />         <br />          Dhivakar<br />         <br />          Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br />          Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;<br />         <br />          Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i <br />beg<br />    to<br />        differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy<br />    even<br />        without the British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more <br />time<br />    but<br />        it would certainly have happened. There is always this <br />attitude<br />    that<br />        without the British we wouldn&#39;t have had the railways,command<br />    over<br />        the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done <br />these<br />        things without the British and we would have remained <br />united. The<br />        British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />        religion and partition would haunt us for ever.<br />         <br />          I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British <br />did<br />    not<br />        rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a<br />    culture<br />        which is as old as ours changed for the better just because <br />of a<br />        minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />        superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over <br />the<br />    weak<br />        let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat<br />    this<br />        country as an English colony.<br />         <br />          What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />        happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />        railways,proper government systems would they be happy that <br />the<br />    US<br />        came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent <br />amongst<br />    us<br />        Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians <br />are<br />    the<br />        ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past"<br />         <br />          Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not <br />that<br />    they<br />        think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"<br />         <br />          Regards<br />          Rahul<br />         <br />          On 2/25/06, R.venketesh  wrote: hear hear<br />         <br />          well said arun<br />         <br />          this is a hatred psychosis imposed on us by our <br />politicians.<br />          hatred towards the brits were the unifying force for the<br />    freedom<br />          movement.<br />         <br />          we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till<br />    1947.and<br />          lets realise its a costly payment.<br />          but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor <br />states<br />          fighting each other.<br />          thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place <br />today.<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan"<br />           wrote:<br />           <br />            I have always felt this "anger" or even "hatred" towards <br />the<br />        Brits<br />          that many<br />            Indians have as just a wee <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> irrational.

			<div class="content">The British did quite a number of good things to our society. Education was<br />really the jewel in that.
