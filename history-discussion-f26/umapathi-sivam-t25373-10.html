			<div class="content">On the question of miracles, I would like to add a small anecdote given<br />by Dada J. P. Vaswani, the spiritual leader of most of the Sindhis<br />living all over the world.<br /><br />He frequently conducts question-answer sessions with school and college<br />students and youth. At the end of one such session, he asked the<br />participants (just before winding up) what they wanted, expecting a<br />question. A few of the girls shouted ice-creme. He did not know what to<br />do, but one of the Sindhis present, offered to sponsor ice creme for all<br />the young ones present. "This is a miracle I didn't expect," said Dada<br />Vaswani and gave (while ice creme was being arranged) several examples<br />of how even when simple wishes,if fulfilled in an unexpected way, become<br />miracles.<br /><br />Occasions when personal problems are resolved in an unexpected manner,<br />are treated as miracles. A recent example of A R Rahman, his mother and<br />sister converting to Islam, could be labeled as a miracle (by him) when<br />his family's problems were sorted out by a Fakir.<br /><br /><br />I think, if your wish (cure of sicknesses, material benefit, rewards for<br />family members) is fulfilled, then it may be called a "miracle".<br /><br /><br /><br />Sampath<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /><br /><br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hi divakar sir and sps sir,<br /> <br />whenever we look for spiritual conquests...shaivism over jainism</div></blockquote>etc, we are also given stories of miracles ....of stomach aches,<br />miracle cure from illnes, verses not getting burnt, floating on<br />water etc..<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>even in other parallels, like the ten commandments ....the nile</div></blockquote>turning red, hail etc. somehow these do not pass muster to<br />scientific reasoning, and need to be taken with a pinch of salt as<br />you would do when you see ...... spitting out a lingam.<br /><br />We portray our kings with enormous wisdom, vision and tack. maybe<br />the comman man would have been naive enough, but how come even kings<br />swayed from their deep devotion to god and the higher plane ...by<br />these<br /><br />on the otherside, the great saints, they were such exponents of<br />verse..who have communed with god ....were miracles the only way for<br />them to demonstrate that their god was more powerful<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>vj</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Vijay,<br />Miracles do happen time and time and whenever it is necessary. But all these things only for experiencing and for 'loka-kalyaanam' not for advertising or for selfish things.<br /><br />Our Guru used to tell one thing. - there is absolutely no need to God to show His power or to show Himself. But when Hiranya asked his son to show whether Narayana lives in his own built sthambam and if Narayana not present there in that particular sthambam, will prahalaatha accept the theory of Non-goddism but only Hiranyayisim ?- and when Prahalatha said a staunch Yes to his father's challenge, God Narayana got the necessity here to show Himself because of his devotee. God can have any number of non-beleivers BUT He will never loose a staunch devotee like Prahalatha. So the Miracle happened that he has shown Himself as omni-present AND EVEN IN THE EGOIST STHAMBAM of Hiranya.<br /><br />(spitting out lingam) When I asked your question some times back to one Tamil Maathaji from Mumbai, who used to bring out kumkum and sandal powder by 'maya powers' - what is the necessary, and is it true, when it is true, from where. She replied positively but did not explain how. But Mathaaji accepted that this type of tricks not at all necessary if people listen to righteous way of life. She said people do not listen to such advises so these tricks are necessary to take them towards righteous way of life.<br /><br />But severe saadhana will surely provide some unexplained inner powers - again our Guru says - those who utilise these powers for selfish motive - can not sustain long and in fact it will destroy them too.<br /><br />I have seen some miracles myself but I have no scientific explanation - so better to keep with myself.<br /><br />Our Tamil country was home to several siththars. One of my old friend M.Arunachalam, (Once a big contractor here at Vizag) now is called as 'saamiji' used to do penance at Rathnagiri Hills near Vellore. Now and then Saamiji will come to Vizag - and he will never show any such maaya things - since he is a friend of mine I used to take privilage and ask him about these type of miracles. He says these things are to be experienced and, can not be explained. He has experienced several type of 'sidhdhu vilaiyaattu' during his penance. He used to get from unseen pinches in shoulders and 'kuttu' on the top of his head. He says he used to take these things as blessing from the unknown sidhdhars.<br /><br />If you read VaLLalaar varalaaru, will give more light on miracles.<br /><br />Again to come to your point on Saivite-Jain miracles, Nile river turning red, etc., etc. - in my view, we will have to take the only lesson from those types of incidents that is 'satyamEva jayatE'. Vaaymai mattumE vellum. And God will be always siding with righteous people.<br /><br />Dhivakar<br /><br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote:<br />hi divakar sir and sps sir,<br /><br />Many thanks for the detailed explanations....god,gold, glory....will<br />oneday drive us to extinction..<br /><br />a question to divakar sir,<br /><br />whenever we look for spiritual conquests...shaivism over jainism<br />etc, we are also given stories of miracles ....of stomach aches,<br />miracle cure from illnes, verses not getting burnt, floating on<br />water etc..<br /><br />even in other parallels, like the ten commandments ....the nile<br />turning red, hail etc. somehow these do not pass muster to<br />scientific reasoning, and need to be taken with a pinch of salt as<br />you would do when you see ...... spitting out a lingam.<br /><br />We portray our kings with enormous wisdom, vision and tack. maybe<br />the comman man would have been naive enough, but how come even kings<br />swayed from their deep devotion to god and the higher plane ...by<br />these<br /><br />on the otherside, the great saints, they were such exponents of<br />verse..who have communed with god ....were miracles the only way for<br />them to demonstrate that their god was more powerful<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, venkataraman dhivakar<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay<br />  This was purely an &#39;ego&#39; clash.<br /> <br />  Small correction: Kulotthunga-II was not throwing out the image.<br />But immersed into sea - we can put it.

Unlimited storage is just a click away.<br />Dear Vijay,<br />Miracles do happen time and time and whenever it is necessary. But all these things only for experiencing and for 'loka-kalyaanam' not for advertising or for selfish things.<br /><br />Our Guru used to tell one thing. - there is absolutely no need to God to show His power or to show Himself. But when Hiranya asked his son to show whether Narayana lives in his own built sthambam and if Narayana not present there in that particular sthambam, will prahalaatha accept the theory of Non-goddism but only Hiranyayisim ?- and when Prahalatha said a staunch Yes to his father's challenge, God Narayana got the necessity here to show Himself because of his devotee. God can have any number of non-beleivers BUT He will never loose a staunch devotee like Prahalatha. So the Miracle happened that he has shown Himself as omni-present AND EVEN IN THE EGOIST STHAMBAM of Hiranya.<br /><br />(spitting out lingam) When I asked your question some times back to one Tamil Maathaji from Mumbai, who used to bring out kumkum and sandal powder by 'maya powers' - what is the necessary, and is it true, when it is true, from where. She replied positively but did not explain how. But Mathaaji accepted that this type of tricks not at all necessary if people listen to righteous way of life. She said people do not listen to such advises so these tricks are necessary to take them towards righteous way of life.<br /><br />But severe saadhana will surely provide some unexplained inner powers - again our Guru says - those who utilise these powers for selfish motive - can not sustain long and in fact it will destroy them too.<br /><br />I have seen some miracles myself but I have no scientific explanation - so better to keep with myself.<br /><br />Our Tamil country was home to several siththars. One of my old friend M.Arunachalam, (Once a big contractor here at Vizag) now is called as 'saamiji' used to do penance at Rathnagiri Hills near Vellore. Now and then Saamiji will come to Vizag - and he will never show any such maaya things - since he is a friend of mine I used to take privilage and ask him about these type of miracles. He says these things are to be experienced and, can not be explained. He has experienced several type of 'sidhdhu vilaiyaattu' during his penance. He used to get from unseen pinches in shoulders and 'kuttu' on the top of his head. He says he used to take these things as blessing from the unknown sidhdhars.<br /><br />If you read VaLLalaar varalaaru, will give more light on miracles.<br /><br />Again to come to your point on Saivite-Jain miracles, Nile river turning red, etc., etc. - in my view, we will have to take the only lesson from those types of incidents that is 'satyamEva jayatE'. Vaaymai mattumE vellum. And God will be always siding with righteous people.<br /><br />Dhivakar<br /><br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote: <br />hi divakar sir and sps sir,<br /><br />Many thanks for the detailed explanations....god,gold, glory....will<br />oneday drive us to extinction..<br /><br />a question to divakar sir,<br /><br />whenever we look for spiritual conquests...shaivism over jainism<br />etc, we are also given stories of miracles ....of stomach aches,<br />miracle cure from illnes, verses not getting burnt, floating on<br />water etc..<br /><br />even in other parallels, like the ten commandments ....the nile<br />turning red, hail etc. somehow these do not pass muster to<br />scientific reasoning, and need to be taken with a pinch of salt as<br />you would do when you see ...... spitting out a lingam.<br /><br />We portray our kings with enormous wisdom, vision and tack. maybe<br />the comman man would have been naive enough, but how come even kings<br />swayed from their deep devotion to god and the higher plane ...by<br />these<br /><br />on the otherside, the great saints, they were such exponents of<br />verse..who have communed with god ....were miracles the only way for<br />them to demonstrate that their god was more powerful<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, venkataraman dhivakar<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay<br />  This was purely an &#39;ego&#39; clash.<br /> <br />  Small correction: Kulotthunga-II was not throwing out the image.<br />But immersed into sea - we can put it.
