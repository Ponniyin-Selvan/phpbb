This again is a classic case of<br />Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconsequential event (the<br />drowning of the idol) saves Tamil Nadu from being wiped off the face<br />of the earth.<br /><br /><br />The 1st scene is perfectly connected to the climax, remember what<br />Kamal says in the first scene, that he will not say "Om Nama Shivaya"<br />, but Asin tells him to chant it , but still Kamal refuses , ( in this<br />kamal in his story tries to tell that ) Nambi believes in his god more<br />than anything, but Asin feels "Its ok if we change the god or chant<br />other god's name, its life thats most important." Now if u see the<br />climax its JUST OPPOSITEÂ…. Kamal doesn't believe in god much and<br />values lives of people the mostÂ…. but Asin deeply believes in god and<br />that too this dialogue comes when both Asin and Kamal's hand is on the<br />god which came from the sea , and it also means that they are getting<br />united from the place they departed hundreds of years back ( Kamal and<br />Asin).The connection between the 1st scene and the climax in the movie<br />shows the generation circle combined with supernatural powers of GOD<br />and destinyÂ…..!!!<br /><br />If you watch it closely u can also find another actor who has done<br />double action other than Asin and Kamal.<br />Asin's father Sahasranamam [12th Century], in the beginning he says to<br />Nambi "Panchatchira manthirathai sollitu vaango mappillai" and at the<br />End [After tsunami] he says "Avar enna jathiyo inga vaanga paati ".<br />Another Eg. of Chaos Theory and circle of life.<br /><br />JUST IMAGINE THE CHAOS THEORY IN A TAMIL FILM ??<br />WILL ANYONE HAVE THE GUTS TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF A SUBJECT IN A TAMIL<br />FILM?<br /><br />ONLY KAMAL HAS THE GUTSÂ…. U ROCK!!<br /><br />FURTHERÂ—Â—Â—Â—-<br /><br />Nambi explanation<br /><br />Okay, this is slightly outside the chaotic system driving the film as<br />a whole. From what I could gather he says that this story is about<br />ideologies like God,the madness surrounding such ideologies and<br />decides to tell the story of the Shaivite-Vaishnavite conflict to show<br />how people go crazy in the name of God as an example.<br /><br />As a loose end,it gets tied up in the end,when the Ranganathar idol is<br />thrown out of the sea due to the tsunami which highlights the cyclic<br />nature of life.Actually the Nambi character highlights both Chaos and<br />Karma which I explained.That is the brilliance of this film,there is<br />so much to see and understand.<br /><br />Another explanation(and this is slightly far fetchedÂ— as explained<br />earlier) is that Govind is in fact the reincaranation of Nambi. As<br />Nambi he couldn't protect God and died in the name of God.In order to<br />fulfill his Karma,he is reincarnated as Govind Ramasamy who ultimately<br />saves the world from destruction.The idol in the end somewhat hints to<br />this theory; his story began with the idol and it ends with the idol.<br />As far as the connection with Nambi character and events in 12th<br />Century goesÂ…<br />The connection is based on the "Butterfly effect ".<br /><br />When Govind and Andal goes to the bury the idol in the sands, Andal<br />will stumble on a particular stone couple of timesÂ…This is the same<br />stone as the one from 12th Century hen Kothai rips her Thaali and<br />flings it at Kulothunga ChozanÂ…it will end up hanging on the stone.<br />So, the implied message here is Andal is Kothai reborn in the 21s century.<br /><br />During the encounter with Santhana Bharathi in the sand quarry, it is<br />repeat of the incident from 12th century. Instead of Kulothunga<br />Chozhan, it is the Sand Mafia which tries to inflict damage on the land.<br /><br />This movie is a brilliant juxtaposition of independent characters<br />whose paths cross, if only briefly, which is stunning example of Chaos<br />Theory.<br /><br />The idol that is drowned in the sea along with Rangarajan in 12th<br />century by Chozha king results in a fault being developed at the<br />bottom of the ocean and creates tremors more than 800 years later.<br />These tremors result in the Tsunami. This again is a classic case of<br />Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconcsequential event (the<br />drowing of the idol) saves Tamil Nadu from being wiped out off the<br />face of the earth.<br /><br />But actually kamal has not left anything for our imaginationÂ…<br />Explanation struck the right chord, Kamal does tell to Asin in a<br />dialogue that idol which gets sunken back then gets struck between the<br />tectonic plates under the sea and causes tsunamiÂ…<br />Many people missed this dialogue i guess. Kamal's accent was so very<br />perfect Tamil, that many people missed itÂ…. Being perfect Is a Problem<br />by Itself !!! <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Although the explanation is a least possible theory, that is what<br />"Chaos Theory" And "Butterfly Effect" are all about.<br /><br />Its not just the statue that caused the tsunami, but it just started a<br />large chain of effects which kept multiplying exponentially and<br />finally lead to it after 800 yearsÂ….!!<br /><br />Why just say this concept is perfectly illogicalÂ… it is possibleÂ…<br />thats what i have been explaining all the while !!!<br /><br />The story line is that things going wrong are made to be right which<br />involves many people and countries knowingly or unknowingly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Knowingly: <br /><br />-Bush, Manmohan Singh, Govindh, Fletcher, Balaram Naidu, Mallika<br />Sherawath.<br /><br />Unknowingly: <br /><br />-Nambi's drowning to death with the heavy statue causes simple changes<br />to the seabed that causes a devastating tsunami 800 years later<br />[According to Chaos theory it is possible.... although it is least<br />probable... It is possible.. so nothing TOTALLY WRONG About it ]<br />-Poovaragan(actually saved kamal unknowinglyÂ—when poovaragan enters<br />kamal and asin were caught by those manal kollayargal.There poovaragan<br />distracts the gang helping kamal to escape),<br />- Avatar Singh(gave way to Fletcher to escape in the airport unknowingly),<br />- Japanese(saved govind from fletcher, he knows he is saving but he<br />doesnt know about the play and was there only for revenge),<br />- Kallifulla and family(saved govind unknowingly)Â…Â…..<br />-Vincent is a dalit leader of a lower caste( the so called ) but saved<br />an Iyengar Girl Â…Â…and at the end becomes the son of the Iyengar Paati !!<br />- If Shingen Narahashi's sister was not killed, Fletcher could have<br />killed govind and used the virus for wrong purpose..<br /><br />This is based on Chaos Theory..!!!!!</div>

			<div class="content">Very interesting post, thanks Satish. I have not seen<br />this movie and so i do not choose to judge too much.<br />But to my mind, you can fit any darn tamil movie into<br />chaos theory!!! I mean reverse engineer the story to<br />say this is related to that, you will get it. I have<br />seen some fake spiritual gurus do the same with Karmic<br />theories, i mean come up with hugely contrived<br />explanations especially on puranic stories (eg Vali<br />was someone in his first birth, Sri Rama was someone<br />else they are balancing karma, this that).<br /><br />Kamal is a very smart guy, really he has introduced<br />these big concepts like he is doing something great<br />while telling a regular movie story. It does not hurt<br />people to think, so I don't think that is anything<br />wrong. It does take a Kamal however to make people<br />think that these concepts can be pondered on with the<br />aid of his movie!!<br /><br /><br />--- SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Sorry to bring this topic again.

Kamal doesn&#39;t believe in<br />  god much and<br />  values lives of people the mostÃ‚Â…. but Asin deeply<br />  believes in god and<br />  that too this dialogue comes when both Asin and<br />  Kamal&#39;s hand is on the<br />  god which came from the sea , and it also means that<br />  they are getting<br />  united from the place they departed hundreds of<br />  years back &#40; Kamal and<br />  Asin&#41;.The connection between the 1st scene and the<br />  climax in the movie<br />  shows the generation circle combined with<br />  supernatural powers of GOD<br />  and destinyÃ‚Â…..!!!<br /> <br />  If you watch it closely u can also find another<br />  actor who has done<br />  double action other than Asin and Kamal.<br />  Asin&#39;s father Sahasranamam [12th Century], in the<br />  beginning he says to<br />  Nambi "Panchatchira manthirathai sollitu vaango<br />  mappillai" and at the<br />  End [After tsunami] he says "Avar enna jathiyo inga<br />  vaanga paati ".<br />  Another Eg. of Chaos Theory and circle of life.<br /> <br />  JUST IMAGINE THE CHAOS THEORY IN A TAMIL FILM ??<br />  WILL ANYONE HAVE THE GUTS TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF A<br />  SUBJECT IN A TAMIL<br />  FILM?<br /> <br />  ONLY KAMAL HAS THE GUTSÃ‚Â…. U ROCK!!<br /> <br />  FURTHERÃ‚Â—Ã‚Â—Ã‚Â—Ã‚Â—-<br /> <br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Butterfly effect,in essence, means that small variables in the <br />intial state of a system can result in calamities/unexpected results <br />during a later stage. We, project managers, are hammered this on <br />regular basis to catch up with the issues/defects at the start of <br />the project else pay the price during delivery. <br />But I think for all the pseudo-intellectual explanation, I dont <br />think Dasavatharam is a 'butterfly effect' movie. Its just a plain <br />thriller that is executed well. I would think '12B' as a butterfly <br />effect movie (which is a copy of 'Sliding doors') which diverges at <br />an earlier point and a seemingly innocous decision to board a bus <br />results in drastically different results.<br />To connect the first 20 minutes of the movie (which BTW is the <br />brilliant part of the entire movie) with the rest, the mail says this<br />"Kamal does tell to Asin in a dialogue that idol which gets sunken <br />back then gets struck between the tectonic plates under the sea and <br />causes tsunami"<br />May be I didn't hear it right when I watched it. But the above <br />sentence is the most, absolute BS that can be said and I believe <br />Kamal is not stupid enough to say such a thing. I mean, the writer <br />has no idea of tectonic plates or the subduction process that <br />creates a Tsunami. He/she assumes everyone to be the same and <br />postulates something that is nothing but horse crap.<br />I am not a Kamal fan (primarily because of the intolerable <br />intellectual pretense of his fans in presuming him to be something <br />other than what he is i.e a good actor and someone who works hard, <br />ref. 'ulaga nayagane' song, hubris, anyone?). <br />But I found the movie to be a neat entertainer and having some <br />interesting concepts, new to tamil cinema. No unnecessary songs, <br />biggest relief no Vivek or Vadivelu. I agreed with Jeyamohan's <br />review posted sometime before in this forum. Its just a pop-corn <br />movie and trying to paint it as something else is like trying to <br />understand aliens after watching the 'IJ and crystal skull'. <br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Very interesting post, thanks Satish.

We, project managers, are hammered this on <br />regular basis to catch up with the issues/defects at the start of <br />the project else pay the price during delivery. <br />But I think for all the pseudo-intellectual explanation, I dont <br />think Dasavatharam is a 'butterfly effect' movie. Its just a plain <br />thriller that is executed well. I would think '12B' as a butterfly <br />effect movie (which is a copy of 'Sliding doors') which diverges at <br />an earlier point and a seemingly innocous decision to board a bus <br />results in drastically different results.<br />To connect the first 20 minutes of the movie (which BTW is the <br />brilliant part of the entire movie) with the rest, the mail says this<br />"Kamal does tell to Asin in a dialogue that idol which gets sunken <br />back then gets struck between the tectonic plates under the sea and <br />causes tsunami"<br />May be I didn't hear it right when I watched it. But the above <br />sentence is the most, absolute BS that can be said and I believe <br />Kamal is not stupid enough to say such a thing. I mean, the writer <br />has no idea of tectonic plates or the subduction process that <br />creates a Tsunami. He/she assumes everyone to be the same and <br />postulates something that is nothing but horse crap.<br />I am not a Kamal fan (primarily because of the intolerable <br />intellectual pretense of his fans in presuming him to be something <br />other than what he is i.e a good actor and someone who works hard, <br />ref. 'ulaga nayagane' song, hubris, anyone?). <br />But I found the movie to be a neat entertainer and having some <br />interesting concepts, new to tamil cinema. No unnecessary songs, <br />biggest relief no Vivek or Vadivelu. I agreed with Jeyamohan's <br />review posted sometime before in this forum. Its just a pop-corn <br />movie and trying to paint it as something else is like trying to <br />understand aliens after watching the 'IJ and crystal skull'. <br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot">http://sibipranav.blogspot</a><!-- m -->. com<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Very interesting post, thanks Satish. I have not seen<br />  this movie and so i do not choose to judge too much.<br />  But to my mind, you can fit any darn tamil movie into<br />  chaos theory!!! I mean reverse engineer the story to<br />  say this is related to that, you will get it. I have<br />  seen some fake spiritual gurus do the same with Karmic<br />  theories, i mean come up with hugely contrived<br />  explanations especially on puranic stories &#40;eg Vali<br />  was someone in his first birth, Sri Rama was someone<br />  else they are balancing karma, this that&#41;.<br />  <br />  Kamal is a very smart guy, really he has introduced<br />  these big concepts like he is doing something great<br />  while telling a regular movie story. It does not hurt<br />  people to think, so I don&#39;t think that is anything<br />  wrong. It does take a Kamal however to make people<br />  think that these concepts can be pondered on with the<br />  aid of his movie!!<br />  <br />  <br />  --- SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />  wrote: <br />  <br />    Sorry to bring this topic again.

that plays a factor in how the movie gets<br />    along with "YOU".<br />    <br />    You have got to be Case 1 or Case 2 as i have said<br />    earlier in this<br />    entry,,, No use being Half Baked?..!!!!<br />    <br />    To just brief about these Concepts,<br />    <br />    Q: What is Chaotic System ?<br />    A: Basically a chaotic system is one wherein long<br />    term predictions are<br />    impossible.Like for example,if I push a car, I know<br />    that it is going<br />    to move and it will continue to do so if I go on<br />    pushing it on and<br />    on.However,in a chaotic system,this situation cannot<br />    be predicted over<br />    a long period of time.<br />    Weather for example is a chaotic system.No matter<br />    how good your<br />    instruments are,you simply cannot predict the<br />    weather with 100%<br />    accuracy over a long term basis and forecast it.<br />    <br />    Q: What is the Butterfly Effect ?Matsyavatara<br />    A: It is the most important component of a chaotic<br />    system.Basically, small perturbations results in<br />    amplifications which<br />    completely destroys the original nature of the<br />    system and makes<br />    prediction impossible.<br />    If a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa,it could<br />    result in a cyclone<br />    in USA.&#40;Mark the word COULD&#41;.A highly dumbed down<br />    explanation of the<br />    butterfly effect is in the film Anniyan,where<br />    Vikram&#39;s sister dies<br />    because a liquor shop owner sells liquor on a dry<br />    day.<br />    <br />    Q: OK, how does Dasavatharam incorporate it ?<br />    A: In essence,Dasavathara m talks about 8 characters<br />    who are<br />    inconsequential as such,but are integrated in a<br />    larger picture.Without<br />    Bush,the plane would have been called back.Without<br />    Shinghen, Govind<br />    would be dead.Without the tsunami,the world would<br />    have been<br />    destroyed.Even Krishnaveni Patti plays a very<br />    important role.If she<br />    had not put the vial in the idol,maybe Govind would<br />    have recovered it<br />    then and there and a powerful weapon would have been<br />    unleashed.The<br />    very fact that it went into the idol meant that it<br />    was being<br />    accelerated to its destiny.Without Kaifulla Khan,<br />    Govind would have<br />    never escaped;the list simply goes on.<br />    <br />    Q:OK,so does the film talk about theism or atheism?<br />    A:Neither.It talks about how humans drive the<br />    destiny of the world.<br />    <br />    The idol that is drowned in the sea along with<br />    Rangarajan in 12th<br />    century by Chozha king results in a fault being<br />    developed at the<br />    bottom of the ocean and creates tremors more than<br />    800 years later.<br />    These tremors result in the Tsunami. This again is a<br />    classic case of<br />    Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconsequential<br />    event &#40;the<br />    drowning of the idol&#41; saves Tamil Nadu from being<br />    wiped off the face<br />    of the earth.<br />    <br />    <br />    The 1st scene is perfectly connected to the climax,<br />    remember what<br />    Kamal says in the first scene, that he will not say<br />    "Om Nama Shivaya"<br />    , but Asin tells him to chant it , but still Kamal<br />    refuses , &#40; in this<br />    kamal in his story tries to tell that &#41; Nambi<br />    believes in his god more<br />    than anything, but Asin feels "Its ok if we change<br />    the god or chant<br />    other god&#39;s name, its life thats most important."<br />    Now if u see the<br />    climax its JUST OPPOSITE?. Kamal doesn&#39;t believe in<br />    god much and<br />    values lives of people the most?. but Asin deeply<br />    believes in god and<br />    that too this dialogue comes when both Asin and<br />    Kamal&#39;s hand is on the<br />    god which came from the sea , and it also means that<br />    they are getting<br />    united from the place they departed hundreds of<br />    years back &#40; Kamal and<br />    Asin&#41;.The connection between the 1st scene and the<br />    climax in the movie<br />    shows the generation circle combined with<br />    supernatural powers of GOD<br />    and destiny?..!! !<br />    <br />    If you watch it closely u can also find another<br />    actor who has done<br />    double action other than Asin and Kamal.<br />    Asin&#39;s father Sahasranamam [12th Century], in the<br />    beginning he says to<br />    Nambi "Panchatchira manthirathai sollitu vaango<br />    mappillai" and at the<br />    End [After tsunami] he says "Avar enna jathiyo inga<br />    vaanga paati ".<br />    Another Eg. of Chaos Theory and circle of life.<br />    <br />    JUST IMAGINE THE CHAOS THEORY IN A TAMIL FILM ??<br />    WILL ANYONE HAVE THE GUTS TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF A<br />    SUBJECT IN A TAMIL<br />    FILM?<br />    <br />    ONLY KAMAL HAS THE GUTS?. U ROCK!!<br />    <br />    FURTHER????-<br />    <br />    <br />  === message truncated ===</div></blockquote></div>
