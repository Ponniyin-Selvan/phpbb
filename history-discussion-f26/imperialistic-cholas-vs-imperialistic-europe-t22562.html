			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I remember we had a mail chain long back on difference b/w western invaders and our own kings.<br /><br />I had a point to share with you all.<br /><br />Particularly, i find the following difference b/w the invasion of west over us, and invasion of cholas over the east.<br /><br />1. The west indulged in brutal ways in suppressing the common man and forcing their religion on us.<br />Whereas, the cholas, were ruthless, but once they won, preserved the native tradition and did not forcefully impose any belief on them. (Is there any counter point to this.) I am saying this because, of two reasons. One is that there is no concept of exclusive belief in our society. second is that many of the indigneous traditions in the east asia is still preserved, although overtaken by islam.<br /><br />2. The western imperialism is expoitative, and destructive. They looted as much as possible, and did not worry about the social stability & sustainability.<br />Whereas, our cholas, created self sustaining communities in the east asia, and hence, both our settlers and the locals benefitted out of it. Through out the reign of cholas, the conquered nation also flourished along with the chola country. this is not the case with british imperialism.<br />(Hope, this is the case with most of our kingdoms.. they did not collapse the society)<br /><br /><br />As of now, i have only these two differences. But, i believe there are many b/w western imperialism & the conquest of our kings.<br /><br />I am writing this, because, some of our members earlier stated that war is war, and british did to us what our kings had did to others earlier. I believed that could not be the case, and when i explored more, i found the above major differences.<br /><br />Alternate opinions are welcome..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Looking for last minute shopping deals?

They pillaged the whole country [about Dharwar], <br />slaughtered women,<br />children and Brahmans, and taking the girls destroyed their caste'. <br />Rajaraja's inscriptions claim<br />a complete victory for him, saying that he conquered the 'Ratta <br />7lakh country'. The Chajukya<br />records however assert that the attack was a mere raid and that the <br />Chola forces were driven away<br />to their own territory. It appears from the records of Rajendra I, <br />son of Rajaraja, that it was he<br />who commanded the invading army <br /><br />rgds<br />vj</div>

			<div class="content">Madan.. I dont have any references to quote now.. I just got this<br />feeling, and shared to this group.. Probably this discussion may<br />bring about more details<br /><br />your mail is very Interesting vijay..<br /><br />In this group, some posted a very lengthy detail of Chola's conquest<br />of Burma & east asia. In that, he told, that the cholas stationed a<br />part of their army, to protect his country's traders in burma.<br /><br />Also, it was recorded that there was flourishing trade b/w burma &<br />chola dynasty.. similarly in south east asia.. If there is<br />flourishing trade, then there should be wealth generation in the<br />conquested country..<br /><br />Also, what you have described is battles & Wars.. I am not going in<br />to these details..
