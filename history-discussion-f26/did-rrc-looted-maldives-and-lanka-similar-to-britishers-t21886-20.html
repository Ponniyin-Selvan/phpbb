The <br />  general Jeyamurinadalvar was left in command of the Chola forces <br />  stationed in Sri Lanka.<br />  <br />  Rajendra Chola-2 issued a rare silver coin of the Sri Lanka type <br />  showing on the obverse the legend Sri Rajendra in Nagari letters <br />and <br />  the Chola seated tiger on the reverse. <br />  <br />  &#40;56&#41; Other events during the rule of Rajendra Chola Â– 2 <br />  <br />  In he year A.D.1056 Valavan Pitan Caravan of the Ilaiya Mummuti <br />Chola <br />  Annukkar and of the Perumpatai granted 26 cows for maintaining a <br />  lamp granted in the name of his son Narayanan to the Lord of <br />Padith <br />  Chola Iswarem.<br />  <br />  &#40;57&#41; Rajendra Chola Â– 2 names his heir apparent<br />  <br />  Rajendra in the year A.D.1062 named his youngest brother <br />Virarajendra <br />  as his successor, with the premature death of his son, and his <br />  younger brother Rajamahendra.<br />  <br />  &#40;58&#41; Virarajendra Chola ascends throne as the next Chola emperor<br />  <br />  In the year A.D.1063 with the death of Rajendra Chola - 2, <br />  Virarajendra Chola ascended the throne as the next successor to <br />the <br />  Chola empire.<br />  <br />  &#40;59&#41; Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka<br />  <br />  During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief named <br />Kassapa <br />  set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at Kataragama. <br />&#40;Kathirkamam&#41;.<br />  <br />  The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding this <br />sent <br />  an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola forces <br />were <br />  defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up his <br />northern <br />  frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and returd to <br />  Kattaragama.<br />  <br />  At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu <br />with <br />  his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts to <br />  establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his forces <br />to <br />  futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti became <br />the <br />  ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu.<br />  <br />  He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north Sri <br />  Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general Jeyamurinadalvar <br />  stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola forces <br />  plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the Chola <br />  forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />  Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established himself <br />in <br />  Rohona.<br />  <br />  &#40;60&#41; Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma<br />  <br />  He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a few <br />years <br />  prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king Anuruddha <br />  &#40;A.D.1044-1077&#41; of Pagan who was also the overlord of Rammanadesa <br />  both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />  against Cholas.<br />  <br />  King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />  enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any strain in <br />  relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />  valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode to <br />  Tambalagama.<br />  <br />  &#40;61&#41; Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka<br />  <br />  During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew <br />hostile <br />  and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />continued <br />  with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. <br />  <br />  This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka in <br />the <br />  year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />  Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general Kurukulaththaraiyan.<br />  <br />  He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the northern <br />half <br />  of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to Rohana <br />  with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, Ravideva <br />  and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him.<br />  <br />  In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />  commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious in <br />  which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />  Vijayabahu&#39;s queen captive with many treasures while he escaped to <br />  his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola <br />rule.<br />  <br />  &#40;62&#41; Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka<br />  <br />  Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />  distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah in <br />nagari <br />  letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between two lamps all <br />  under a canopy.<br />  &#40;63&#41; Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent<br />  <br />  In the year A.D.1067 Virarajendra named his son Adhirajendra Chola <br />as <br />  the heir apprarent to the Chola throne and a co-ruler of the <br />empire.<br />  <br />  &#40;64&#41; Kulothunga Chola succeeds on the throne of the Chola Empire <br />  <br />  In the year A.D.1070 with the death of Viarajendra a rebellion <br />  sparked off in the Chola country in which Adhirajendra was <br />  assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom.<br />  <br />  His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way for <br />  prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate successor to <br />  the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year A.D.1071 <br />with <br />  the royal title Kulotunga Chola.<br />  <br />  &#40;65&#41; Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism<br />  <br />  During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who earlier <br />hid <br />  in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, <br />gradually <br />  establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda in <br />  south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island <br />from <br />  the long standing grip of Cholas.<br />  <br />  In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large forces <br />  simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka against <br />the <br />  Chola forces.<br />  <br />  The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola <br />strongholds <br />  at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, <br />Buddhigama, <br />  Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present <br />Kurunagala <br />  district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces were <br />  defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These troops <br />  further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the seaport of <br />  Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district.<br />  <br />  The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the <br />eastern <br />  province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the Chola <br />  forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. When <br />they <br />  reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the Sinhala <br />generals <br />  requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with further fresh <br />forces.<br />  <br />  Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />  proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />  Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close vicinity <br />of <br />  Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along east <br />coast.<br />  <br />  The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close vicinity <br />  all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle <br />with <br />  Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu&#39;s two great warriors Ravideva and Cala <br />who <br />  joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined <br />Vijayabahu <br />  and fought with determination to exterminate the Cholas, and <br />ending <br />  up with the victory to Sinhala forces.<br />  <br />  Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri Lanka, <br />  assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha&#39;.<br />  <br />  &#40;66&#41; Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess <br />  <br />  During this period the wife and the daughter of the north Indian <br />king <br />  Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country after defeat <br />at <br />  the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, escaped from Chola <br />  country and came back to Sri Lanka.<br />  <br />  They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />  Leelawathie and took her as his first consort.<br />  <br />  &#40;67&#41; KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka<br />  <br />  Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition in <br />the <br />  far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal years <br />in <br />  peace and refrained from reacting further.<br />  <br />  In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of the <br />king <br />  Vijayabahu&#39;s sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity <br />against <br />  cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his sister who <br />  were long time allies of the sri Lankan kings.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  &#40;59&#41; The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire<br />  <br />  The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the cholas marked the <br />  beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas <br />empire <br />  from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra.<br />  <br />  &#40;60&#41; King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country<br />  <br />  Kullotunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka sent <br />  envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same <br />period <br />  the sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka kingdom in <br />the <br />  Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by some <br />natives.<br />  <br />  Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />  Kulotunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered his <br />  troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in the <br />  present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089.<br />  <br />  The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri <br />Lanka <br />  and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu <br />earlier <br />  now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with thier <br />  motherland.<br />  <br />  In the revolt they caused destruction around Pullathinagara the <br />  present Polonnaruwa and captured the king&#39;s sister Mitta with her <br />  three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south.<br />  <br />  However he returned back with his son Virabahu to Pullaththinagra <br />  defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and established <br />  himself as the sole king of Sri lanka.<br />  <br />  &#40;61&#41; King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with Cholas  <br />  <br />  In the year A.D.1104 king Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka revived his <br />  ambition to fight the Cholas and awaited their forces at the ports <br />of <br />  Mannar in response to his challeng.

Beleive me, get your hands on a copy of the<br />  mahavamsa &#40; the lankan chronicle&#41;.. ...slaves were taken even prior<br />  to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> times. without going into detail there are accounts of<br />  lankans in large numbers &#40; in thousands&#41; brought as slaves - again<br />  all this is speculation - karikalan is said to hv brought 12000 to<br />  build the kallanai. gaja bahu is said to hv come and liberated these<br />  and taken an equal number of tamils back....again contradicting<br />  accounts of this event come up.<br /> <br />  <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> not only recovered the pandya diadem but also the crown of<br />  lankan king, and not stopping at that - brought the king mahinda V<br />  and his queen and kept them under house arrest in madurai. the king<br />  died after 12 years in captivity in madurai.Anuradhapur a, the 1400-<br />  year-old capital of Sinhala kings was destroyed - The destruction<br />  was so extensive the city was abandoned.
