To him she appeared to be one<br />born in a royal family or at least in a family that was upper class.<br /><br />Kalki is quite a traditionalist and he will not make his character<br />call its father as her fiance. That is ruled out and Nandini<br />repeatedly mentions at various points that Veerapandian was her lover<br />and one who has promised to marry her. So Veerapandian is also ruled out.<br /><br />Sundara Chozhan could not have been the father - the time lines do not<br />match.<br /><br />But there is one small clue - when Nandini tells Adithan who her real<br />father is, Adithan is surprised and cannot believe it.<br /><br />Now who could this character be that makes Adithan so surprised?  <br /><br />Let us now look at history.

My bad.<br /><br />Amara Bhujangan becomes their leader but that is only till that Pandiyan boy (whom Nandini dotes on) comes of age to be the next Pandiyan king (from whatever I understand).<br /><br />If Nandini thought that she was Veerapandiyan's daughter, and if Mathuranthakam was also around, what makes her not crown him as the next king instead? The reason why she does not bring Mathuranthakam into her fold is because he cannot be the next in line for the Pandiya throne.<br /><br />At least this is how I will deduce it given the evidence.<br /><br />But probably the confusion arose when he decided to make Amuthan as the next heir instead of the palaya Mathuranthakan. Till that point it was not clear why the palaya Mathuranthakan resembled Nandini..<br /><br />I agree - Kalki seems to have done less homework on that web of palaya Mathuranthakan, Nandini and Amuthan. there seems to be glaring loop holes in that part of the plot.<br /><br />-reachkalki<br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: R.venketesh <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Thursday, 1 May, 2008 5:36:46 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Nandini's father<br /><br />Hi<br />the evidence from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is what I meant.<br />amara pujangan is the second avathar of palaya mathuranthakan <br />according to kalki.<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Kalki Kalki  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Venkatesh<br />  <br />  I thought Nandini was a fictional character.

So Veerapandian is also     ruled out.            Sundara Chozhan could not have been the father - the time lines   do     not      match.            But there is one small clue - when Nandini tells Adithan who her     real      father is, Adithan is surprised and cannot believe it.            Now who could this character be that makes Adithan so surprised?             Let us now look at history. It is well known that the Pandiya   kings      and the Lankan Kings have had relationships in terms of giving and      taking women in marriage.            Oomai Rani is from Eezham. And her daughter was the Pandya King      Veerapandiyan' s fiance and he had promised to marry her.            Put two and two together - it is quite likely that after Sundara      Chozhan deserted her, Oomai Rani was involved with the Srilankan     king      and gave birth to the twins.           Aggregating all this, it becomes clear that Nandini was the Sri     Lankan      King's daughter and hence had all the support of the Pandiyanattu      apathuthavigaL in her quest to avenge the death of Veerapandian.           And it is this truth that surprised Adithan making him tell her   that      he is very sorry for what he did.            Does anyone agree withme or is this a far fetched argument?                                #ygrp-mkp{    border:1px solid #d8d8d8;font- family:Arial; margin:14px   0px;padding: 0px 14px;}    #ygrp-mkp hr{    border:1px solid #d8d8d8;}    #ygrp-mkp #hd{    color:#628c2a; font-size: 85%;font- weight:bold; line-  height:122%; margin:10px 0px;}    #ygrp-mkp #ads{    margin-bottom: 10px;}    #ygrp-mkp .ad{    padding:0 0;}    #ygrp-mkp .ad a{    color:#0000ff; text-decoration: none;}    --                #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{    font-family: Arial;}    #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{    margin:10px 0px;font-weight: bold;font- size:78%; line-height: 122%;}    #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{    margin-bottom: 10px;padding: 0 0;}    --                #ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px; font-family: arial, helvetica,   clean, sans-serif;}   #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit; font:100% ;}    #ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica,   clean, sans-serif;}    #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}    #ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height: 1.22em;}    #ygrp-text{    font-family: Georgia;    }    #ygrp-text p{    margin:0 0 1em 0;}    #ygrp-tpmsgs{    font-family: Arial;    clear:both;}    #ygrp-vitnav{    padding-top: 10px;font- family:Verdana; font-size: 77%;margin: 0;}    #ygrp-vitnav a{    padding:0 1px;}    #ygrp-actbar{    clear:both;margin: 25px 0;white-space: nowrap;color: #666;text-  align:right; }    #ygrp-actbar .left{    float:left;white- space:nowrap; }    .bld{font-weight: bold;}    #ygrp-grft{    font-family: Verdana;font- size:77%; padding:15px 0;}    #ygrp-ft{    font-family: verdana;font- size:77%; border-top: 1px solid #666;    padding:5px 0;    }    #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{    padding-bottom: 10px;}        #ygrp-reco {    margin-bottom: 20px;padding: 0px;}    #ygrp-reco #reco-head {    font-weight: bold;color: #ff7900;}        #reco-grpname{    font-weight: bold;margin- top:10px; }    #reco-category{    font-size:77% ;}    #reco-desc{    font-size:77% ;}        #ygrp-vital{    background-color: #e0ecee;margin- bottom:20px; padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}    #ygrp-vital #vithd{    font-size:77% ;font-family: Verdana;font- weight:bold; color:#333; text-  transform:uppercase ;}    #ygrp-vital ul{    padding:0;margin: 2px 0;}    #ygrp-vital ul li{    list-style-type: none;clear: both;border: 1px solid #e0ecee;    }    #ygrp-vital ul li .ct{    font-weight: bold;color:#ff7900;float: right;width: 2em;text-  align:right; padding-right: .5em;}   #ygrp-vital ul li .cat{    font-weight: bold;}    #ygrp-vital a{    text-decoration: none;}        #ygrp-vital a:hover{    text-decoration: underline; }        #ygrp-sponsor #hd{    color:#999;font- size:77%; }    #ygrp-sponsor #ov{    padding:6px 13px;background- color:#e0ecee; margin-bottom: 20px;}    #ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{    padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0; }    #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{    list-style-type: square;padding: 6px 0;font-size: 77%;}    #ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{    text-decoration: none;font- size:130% ;}    #ygrp-sponsor #nc{    background-color: #eee;margin- bottom:20px; padding:0 8px;}    #ygrp-sponsor .ad{    padding:8px 0;}    #ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{    font-family: Arial;font- weight:bold; color:#628c2a; font-  size:100%;line- height:122% ;}    #ygrp-sponsor .ad a{    text-decoration: none;}    #ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{    text-decoration: underline; }    #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{    margin:0;}    o{font-size: 0;}    .MsoNormal{    margin:0 0 0 0;}    #ygrp-text tt{    font-size:120% ;}    blockquote{margin: 0 0 0 4px;}    .replbq{margin: 4;}    --                             Bring your gang together.

As a <br />true fan<br />  one is supposed to accept the flaws along with the positives.<br />  To get a list of flaws in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> please go through the archives, there <br />are some<br />  incredible threads.<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  Rahul<br />  <br />  On 5/2/08, singanallur ramaswamy  wrote: <br />   <br />    Hi,<br />   <br />    I don&#39;t think Kalki had slipped up as has been repeatedly alleged <br />by Mr<br />    Venkat. In fact in a chapter close to the end of the magnum opus <br />he has<br />    explained why Nandini had called veerapandiyan as his lover, to <br />incite<br />    karikalan and do a dreadful job or karikalan, in his anger at <br />seeing nandini<br />    attending to the injured veerapandiyan, not understanding what <br />Nandini tells<br />    him before he beheads veerapandiyan.

To him she appeared to <br />be<br />    one<br />          born in a royal family or at least in a family that was <br />upper<br />      class.<br />         <br />          Kalki is quite a traditionalist and he will not make his<br />    character<br />          call its father as her fiance. That is ruled out and Nandini<br />          repeatedly mentions at various points that Veerapandian was <br />her<br />        lover<br />          and one who has promised to marry her. So Veerapandian is <br />also<br />        ruled out.<br />         <br />          Sundara Chozhan could not have been the father - the time <br />lines<br />      do<br />        not<br />          match.<br />         <br />          But there is one small clue - when Nandini tells Adithan who<br />    her<br />        real<br />          father is, Adithan is surprised and cannot believe it.<br />         <br />          Now who could this character be that makes Adithan so<br />    surprised?<br />         <br />          Let us now look at history. It is well known that the <br />Pandiya<br />      kings<br />          and the Lankan Kings have had relationships in terms of <br />giving<br />    and<br />          taking women in marriage.<br />         <br />          Oomai Rani is from Eezham. And her daughter was the Pandya <br />King<br />          Veerapandiyan&#39; s fiance and he had promised to marry her.<br />         <br />          Put two and two together - it is quite likely that after <br />Sundara<br />          Chozhan deserted her, Oomai Rani was involved with the<br />    Srilankan<br />        king<br />          and gave birth to the twins.<br />         <br />          Aggregating all this, it becomes clear that Nandini was the <br />Sri<br />        Lankan<br />          King&#39;s daughter and hence had all the support of the<br />    Pandiyanattu<br />          apathuthavigaL in her quest to avenge the death of <br />Veerapandian.<br />         <br />          And it is this truth that surprised Adithan making him tell <br />her<br />      that<br />          he is very sorry for what he did.<br />         <br />          Does anyone agree with me or is this a far fetched argument?<br />         <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        <br />       <br />        <br />       <br />        <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Bring your gang together.
