			<div class="content">Hi sathish<br /><br />the basic question where this discussion started whas who united <br />india as it is today?<br /><br />you said if the british didnt do it then somebody else would have.<br />thats not how we approach a problem.<br />be specific,<br />who else?<br />there must have been 4-5000 countries in this land when the mughals <br />broke up.<br />who could have united them.<br /><br />a colonialist takes over a country for his own interests . not <br />charity.<br />india took over kashmir and sikkim for its own benefit not for <br />charity.<br />inspite of that as sri said the british cared to reform what they <br />could.<br />the presidency college in chennai stared by the british has produced <br />2 nobel laureates. one before freedom and one after.<br /><br />thats why i asked you a question<br />whose rule was better?<br />today you live under a chief minister who denies the existence of <br />your very god. i dont think the british ever went to that extent.<br /><br />you live in a country where the government employs goons to thrash <br />and kill people in 17,000 acres, rape their women, burn their houses <br />because the communist( ha ha) government have sold the land to a <br />foreign company.<br />is this any better than jallinwalla bagh.?<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar <br />Arunachalam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I dont think this argument is going anywhere. But I feel Sri and <br />  Venkat refuses to accept the ill&#39;s the british has left back.<br />  <br />  I clearly said - British rule is like giving a pot full of rice to <br />a <br />  hungry person with a drop of poison in it. Simple, loud and clear.<br />  <br />  A small drop in a potfull might not kill the person, but surely <br />will <br />  have some side effects, and ofcourse ill effects. Thats what <br />British <br />  rule has led us to.<br />  <br />  I didnt get any impression from Ravi&#39;s mail that he was supporting <br />  Aurangzeb&#39;s rule to British rule. I wonder whether I got it wrong <br />of <br />  Venkat got it wrong, and why should I be questioned for this. <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  <br />  Venkat was the one who told me &#40;taught me&#41; that for almost 80 years <br />  of Muslim rule in Madurai there were no Hindu celebrations. Later I <br />  learnt it when I read &#39;Thiruvarangan Ula&#39;. For nearly 5 century&#39;s <br />  Bhrath was plundered by muslim invasion and the foundations of <br />  sanathana dharma was shaken. Then came Sivaji to rebuild the Hindu <br />  nation. From a gross adharma of Aurangzeb&#39;s rule, we did get some <br />  good, a concept of Hindu liberty. But what did we get out of <br />British <br />  rule, apart from Indian Railways and the corrupted adminstrative <br />  system. Thats whay I meant by &#39;a potful of rice with a drop of <br />  poison&#39;. A evil in the disguise of good.<br />  <br />  When Sri and Venkat say that we should look at our ills, I am <br />asking <br />  them, why dont you look at the goods we had? I strongly feel that <br />  taking a balanced look at of our goods and bads and taking the good <br />  and leaving the bad behind is the path to success. Pondering over <br />  the bads alone will take us no where. you are saying the glass i <br />  half empty, people like me and Ravi say the glass is half full. <br />Same <br />  points in different perspective.<br />  <br />  What has happened has happened. We cant change it. But we should <br />  admit that amidst a few good, the British has done a lot of harm to <br />  us. Material development can be achived only if we have a strong <br />  minds. British gave us material development but ruined our thought <br />  process. Thats a hard fact which everyone should accept.<br />  <br />  Saying that without english &#40;meaning without British coming to <br />  India&#41;, we could not have become global IT power, is baseless. What <br />  about China? They are equally good. Only problem they have is lack <br />  of English. Now they have realized it and started learning english. <br />  In next 10 years, they will also be good in English. Its a matter <br />of <br />  time. If we were not talking english, we would have in next 10 <br />  years. Matter of time. compulsion of time. No one can go against <br />it. <br />  Just for giving english knowledge, we should not say British did a <br />  lot of good to us. They did equal amount of good and equal amount <br />of <br />  bad. But the bad&#39;s have a long lasting impact than the good they <br />  did. Lets accept it.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    -<br />    Hi<br />    I should ask sathish mainly if he agrees with it.so we gladly <br />  kept <br />    watching when aurangazeb knocked off a few thousand hindu temples</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Venkat,<br /><br />I have given enough proofs for my points, and please refer to them.<br /><br />"We should see history as it is, and NOT As we are"<br /><br />If we judge history by our own morals, then it would not be history. but<br />bunch of facts to be hated by us.<br /><br />I feel, you havent countered my arguments, in particular.. rather you<br />have been replyin in general, that we should accept our wrongs, and<br />should not hide it under the guise of patriotism..<br /><br />I agree.. and we are not hiding any thing.. But, your generic (&<br />generous) branding of our history as barbarious without british, is not<br />only offensive, but of highly ill taste.<br /><br />I would like to know the morals in which you brand a thing as right &<br />wrong. Or, on what basis did you term those things as problematic or<br />barbaric.<br /><br />So, the basic question itself is not answered..<br /><br />By the way, in your own arguments, that we have to accept our wrongs of<br />ours.. Agreed.. But shouldn't we accept the atrocities, and barbaric<br />activities of the britishers too?<br /><br />What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong.. but<br />let's praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..<br /><br />I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..<br /><br />You are so easily terming sati (which is almost voluntary ) as barbaric,<br />and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere historic<br />incident.<br /><br />You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet, the Goa<br />Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities (like<br />inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front of<br />their husband) by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to you..<br /><br />You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree the<br />fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers in<br />Mumbai and calcutta... (You might feel, the red-light prostitution of<br />mumbai would be better than devdaasi system)..<br /><br />And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of nun.. <br />(this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women accepted<br />god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances)..<br />And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in Europe.. <br />Would you term them as Barbaric? (you may say it happens in europe..<br />but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also the<br />fact, that the nuns are produced & misused in india too)<br /><br /><br />So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />negatives for our country?<br /><br />I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go through<br />those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />vague opinionist argument.<br /><br />We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you.. but<br />in a term, based on true understanding of india. (we are really<br />becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media controlled<br />still by the colonial rulers)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-Hi<br />  everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting<br />  personal or emotional about it.<br /> <br />  that was a long reply and befor vk replies i&#39;ll just like to add<br />  santayana&#39;s statement on history<br /> <br />  &#39;those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"<br /> <br />  just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a<br />  confident indian.<br />  its just hogwash.<br />  the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a<br />  problem.<br /> <br />  we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />  system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them or<br />  placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.<br /> <br />  in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic excesses<br />  in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />  its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />  patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />  i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in his<br />  society and points out to them bravely.<br /> <br />  its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point out.<br /> <br /> <br />  venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Venkat,<br /><br />You are referring to the select few maharajas, that too under the<br />british rule..<br /><br />We had numerous other examples.. for example, i have read an article<br />in tamil magazine "vaaramalar", where the travancore maharaja was<br />under immense pressure from the british collector to pay the tax, but<br />that year there was very little tax collected due to famine. He was<br />ready to get arrested, but the next day, the whole people of his<br />dominion, came forward and offered all their golds, and some women<br />even her gold mangala (thaali), and saved their maharaja from getting<br />arrested.<br /><br />There are numerous such incidents that occurred, but we are not taught<br />about these.. and because we are not taught about those, we are so<br />less, in confidence, that we often denigrate ourselves under the grab<br />of "Accepting the truth"...<br /><br />Ok.. what i ask is how could india be the richest country, when<br />britishers came, under the same maharajas?<br /><br />Please see how wealthy, the empire of vijayanagar.. Please read the<br />book "The forgotten empire" in the following link<br /><br /><br /><br />Again, what you term is another peculiar disease of degrading our own<br />kings, and place them in par with the invaders, as though we are third<br />persons having no relation to them.. this is another theory and<br />argument propogated by the wester imperialistic english media.<br /><br />Our kings are part of us unlike the invaders who came to loot us.. <br />Our kings protected us, administered us, and under their rule, our<br />people were far far richer than the rest of the world. accusing our<br />kings of luxuries is completely out of context, and a gross<br />mis-representation.<br /> <br />The main reason, why our kings were lost is because we had the raja<br />dharma, followed by almost all our ancient kings. Prithviraj chauhan<br />forgiving ghori is because of our epic example of ramayana.. there is<br />least probability that he might have expected ghori to be so barbaric,..<br /><br />We had our rajadharma, where the enemy is also treated wisely..<br /><br />Its our great virtues which led to our demise, rather than our<br />dis-unity. BEcause, the kind of warfare that the muslims and<br />christians fought, were completely alien to us.. We could very well<br />compare the invasion of alexander with the later muslims and christian<br />kingdoms..  <br /><br />In that context, it was first the king of orissa, who employed equal<br />brutal tactics to drive away the invading muslims and then later<br />followed by the shivaji maharaj..<br /><br />And the whole of south india rallied behind the vijayanagara rulers,<br />to fight against the muslim invaders.. Arent this, not a sign of unity?<br /><br />Again, i would like to highligh.. our kings failed mostly because of<br />our virtues inspired from our epics, and partly, the ruthless war<br />tactics followed by the invading forces, which is completely alien to us.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best. <br />  You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a <br />  bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages.

			<div class="content">Venkat,<br /><br />I accept your view, that the entity of india was british creation.. we<br />are lands of small kingdoms, which existed under large kingdoms.<br /><br />But, i would like to emphasize that we are culturally united, and the<br />common masses in our ancient india existed as separate entity than the<br />political entity. Political fights are regarded as normal between the<br />kshatriyas, and whoever wins over, taken over the control, and the<br />people accepted their rule, as long as they followed dharma.<br /><br />The britishers, united the whole of india, because, not for the purpose<br />of uniting us, but for their consolidation for the administrative<br />purposes.<br /><br />I would like to highlight one of Gandhiji's reply to such question.<br /><br />The britishers colonised Africa, middle east, and southeast asia.. But<br />they could not establish a single state for the whole of africa or the<br />middle east? Instead they created government of rwanda, congo,<br />southafrice etc etc.. on the other hand, they established Government of<br />India, rather than government of bengal, or government of madras..<br /><br />Could you please explain why?<br /><br />Its because, the people of the whole india rallied behind the half-naked<br />man.. and how is that possible? Because, the people of india regarding<br />rishis and saints in high respect, and they saw gandhi as a saint and<br />hence rallied behind this.<br /><br />now this culture of people is the uniting force, that made britishers to<br />see the unity among whole of india.. and the reason for this culture is<br />that people were largely existed as separate entity than the political<br />entity.<br /><br /><br />Ok.. coming to your point, should we thank them for creating a single<br />india? (ofcourse, its not them who integrated india, but our great<br />sardar vallabhai patel.. if it had been nehru, then it would be total<br />chaos)..<br /><br />Infact, they are the ones, who separated the nation in to two with the<br />aim of checkmating such a great nation rising as super power in future..<br />The partition was opposed by majority of people in pakistan itself, but<br />because it suited britishers, they divided it.<br /><br />Secondly, the kashmir was their own creation, and it was exposed in the<br />recent news article, that mountbatted used his wife to influence nehru<br />to accept kashmir's reference to UN..<br /><br />Thirdly, till 1990's the british conspired with americans and made all<br />attempts against india to contain it..<br /><br />Inspite of all these recent historic facts, do you want to get excited<br />at their so called goodness to us?<br /><br />After all, the very reason they left india was, that there was nothing<br />left over to exploit us.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi ravi<br />  you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and<br />  boring others to the bottoms of their limits.<br /> <br />  but just tell me<br />  what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850,<br />  1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />  if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such<br />  entity.<br /> <br />  today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we<br />  should hate them.<br />  the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi<br />  driver in ajman UAE.<br /> <br />  borders change, and so does history with it.<br />  european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic<br />  tracts as single entities .<br />  indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />  while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir,<br />  or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting<br />  incompatible people.<br />  in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese<br />  and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case<br />  against them.<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu ravi_eds@ wrote: <br />   <br />    Dear Venkatesh<br />   <br />    Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best.<br />  You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a<br />  bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages.

What made these dumb guys so patriotic that they could not<br />  tolerate the british but could tolerate every other ruler even as<br />  horrible as aurangazeb ?<br />   <br />    Oh I forgot, we were split into so many zamindars and duh how the<br />  heck did they all unite under a half naked man ?<br />   <br />    Every country has its dark age, every economy has its fall, every<br />  kingdom has to crash, every corporate has to buckle sometime, law of<br />  nature.<br />    5th century to 1000 AD was british dark age, India started from<br />  1100 to 1700 - not as a dark age but as unstable period. 1300 - 1600<br />  was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances &#40;many people<br />  opposing the mugal autocratic rule&#41; during that time when the country<br />  was &#39;rediscovering&#39; itself, which people like you conveniently call<br />  as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled<br />  for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250.<br />  Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many<br />  states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the<br />  biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of<br />  the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was<br />  spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil<br />  heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country.<br />   <br />    Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals<br />  tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah<br />  ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of<br />  their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were<br />  they can spread their culture, education &#40;as if no one else was<br />  educated&#41;, systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people<br />  such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst<br />  you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going<br />  the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.<br />   <br />    India, an internal economy, there in was her strength, the british<br />  wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on<br />  Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the<br />  industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the<br />  Imperial Gazzetter of 1881: <br />    some experts<br />    1903-04 Data is Lakh Rupees &#40;Rupees of that Era&#41;<br />    Items Imports Exports &#40;Textile&#41;<br />    Apparels 172 16<br />    Raw Cotton 5 2438<br />    Cotton Goods 31288 10<br />    Wool Items 215 27<br />    My country paid &#40;imported&#41; Rs 31,680 lakhs and sold &#40;exported&#41;<br />  Rs.2500 lakh... rocket science on the numbers. This is only in<br />  textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see that<br />  a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for 100<br />  years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with<br />  their rule.<br />   <br />    Gandhi systematically counteracted them by dismantling their<br />  managerial capacities, hitting them where it mattered the most, Tata<br />  built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for Tata,<br />  they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and<br />  Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from<br />  India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield.<br />    Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and<br />  that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead.<br />    You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our<br />  money.<br />    And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still<br />  available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan of<br />  chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british<br />  rule to MLA&#39;s of republic of India. We are still at war with our<br />  neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will<br />  always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise<br />  today or tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont<br />  release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool!<br />   <br />    This is a great country, no matter how many people work hard on<br />  demotivating us or plundering us, we will prove our mettle. One thing<br />  is for sure, it is immaterial if Maculay really said his famous quote<br />  in 1835, what is alleged definitely is happening today. They have<br />  successfully planted their domain in minds of many indians. It is<br />  another test for the great nation and I am sure she will come good as<br />  usual.<br />   <br />    -- Ravi<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: R.venketesh abhivencat@<br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 11:17:15 PM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence<br />  India<br />   <br />    Hi Venu<br />    I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />    thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their<br />    taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.<br />   <br />    most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who<br />    saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh<br />  war.<br />    the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />    what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful<br />    nation called india in say 1600.<br />    if you were born in 1600 &#40; or as you say 1970 if the british had<br />  not<br />    come at all&#41; you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of<br />    pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of<br />  ramnad<br />    or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of<br />    madurai.<br />    that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />    you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great<br />  show<br />    of unity united on their own in the national interest and then<br />  opened<br />    negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of<br />    hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore,<br />    the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin.<br />    this would have united south india.<br />    then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern<br />  hindu<br />    muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings&#40; ar you will be<br />    calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon&#41; to<br />    unite one democratic nation called india.<br />    you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />    even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the<br />  sardar<br />    to join the indian confedration.<br />    the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and<br />    you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf<br />  so<br />    that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />    its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.<br />   <br />    have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited<br />    in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been<br />    discussing.<br />   <br />    to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but<br />    trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.<br />   <br />    patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should<br />  not<br />    be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"<br />   <br />    what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or<br />  the<br />    slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un<br />  united<br />    india.<br />    regards<br />    venketesh<br />   <br />     <br />      Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric<br />    tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a<br />    shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters....<br />  pathetic<br />    and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how<br />    people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence<br />  India<br />    is not to be diverted as &#39;oh the british were better&#39;, that is<br />    childish and namesake pathetic argument.<br />     <br />      Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability,<br />    child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly<br />    set afire by the British.<br />     <br />      Sati: <br />      1. A certain &#39;indian&#39; by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core<br />  of<br />    issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. &#40;British never<br />    allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have<br />    added more points below.&#41;<br />      2.Talk about a widow&#39;s life without her husband was not easy at<br />    that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage.<br />  honestly<br />    how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life<br />    is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />    treatment she gets even today.<br />      We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />    there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />    there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />    during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />      The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />    by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />    lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />    1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of<br />    compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />    hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />    with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />      Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It ties<br />    up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />    where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />     <br />      Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />    concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />    middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />  open.<br />    Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />    etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />    book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />    untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />    1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new<br />    definition as caste politics now.<br />     <br />      Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />  kaamanai<br />    vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />    the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />    Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />    their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39;<br />  was<br />    to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />    reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />    what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />  dating<br />    was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />    reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />    and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />  is<br />    taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our<br />  great<br />    grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />  were<br />    children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />    the success of child<br />      mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />  dated<br />    concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; to<br />    follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />    our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />    girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life.<br />    Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />    internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or the<br />    energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />    &#39;talent&#39;.<br />     <br />      A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />    African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious<br />  comment<br />    or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />    understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />    India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />  serious<br />    literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />  in<br />    Africa is more or less degrading my country.<br />     <br />      A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />    by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy<br />    trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />      There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />  management<br />    people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />      people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />    dyre or jackson the<br />      british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />      supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />    even<br />      caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />  british<br />    to rethink a motive. That<br />      is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty British<br />  -<br />    I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />      patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />  india<br />    was<br />      definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />    Kalki&#39;s<br />      comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />  Britain<br />    is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />  were<br />    the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />  worthless<br />    and sing<br />      hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />    does<br />      not exist without the west.<br />     <br />      Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />      equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain<br />  is<br />    Europe&#39;s crime<br />      hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation<br />    recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is<br />    like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them<br />  making<br />    mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather<br />  than<br />    adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.<br />     <br />      A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more<br />  worry.<br />      What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor<br />  citizens<br />      who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.<br />     <br />     <br />      I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real<br />    Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.<br />     <br />      On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british<br />  able<br />    to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were<br />    Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have<br />  an<br />    idea now.<br />     <br />      -- Ravi<br />      ----- Original Message ----<br />      From: viru <br />      To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />      Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 8:21:21 AM<br />      Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence<br />    India<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Dear Venkateswaran,<br />     <br />      I would definitely be against all your points. What you<br />  described,<br />    may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />    characteristics of india.<br />     <br />      I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />    our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />    of ourself.<br />     <br />      Ok. let me counter your points.<br />     <br />      1&#41; The Sati system<br />      The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />    Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />  women.<br />      Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />    areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />  you<br />    to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />  a<br />    women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in the following link&#41;<br />     <br />      <br />     <br />     <br />      2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />     <br />      I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />    this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />    should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />  dress<br />    style is entirely different..<br />     <br />      3. Untouchability: <br />     <br />      This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />    Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />    caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />    SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste&#39;s family.<br />     <br />      Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />    semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />  india,<br />    the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />    semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />     <br />      The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br />     <br />      4. Education & Employment: <br />     <br />      Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />    ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />  in<br />    Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />    today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />      The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />    all over madras presidency.<br />     <br />      You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.<br />     <br />       3beautiful-<br />    tree.zip <br />     <br />      5&#41; Fate of widows<br />      You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />    they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />    western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th<br />    century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />     <br />      6. Devadasi: <br />     <br />      Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />    were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />    devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />     <br />      The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />    highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />    sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />    devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />    choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />  the<br />    concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />  effect.&#41;<br />     <br />      See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />  bharatanatyam,<br />    were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />    lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />      Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />    prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />    cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded<br />  to<br />    prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />    rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />     <br />     <br />      7. Slavery: <br />      Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />    time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br />     <br />      8. Child Marriage: <br />     <br />      Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />    usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />    relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />    girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The<br />    girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her<br />    childhood and get adapted to it.<br />     <br />      Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />    days.<br />     <br />      "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in<br />  the<br />    west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />     <br />      If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />    it is considered as evil.<br />     <br />      9. Priestly Class<br />     <br />      Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />  and<br />    spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />    profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />  with<br />    brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />    vellalars.<br />     <br />      also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />    priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />    untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />     <br />      So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />    castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed<br />    priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br />     <br />      10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />     <br />      This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />    mother tongues..<br />     <br />      11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />     <br />      Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />    animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its<br />  sacrificed<br />    in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br />     <br />      Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />    slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />      Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />    community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is barbarious,<br />    and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />     <br />      Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />     <br />      Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />  that,<br />    let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />     <br />     <br />      we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />     <br />      I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />    committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />    Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />    committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />     <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />      <br />     <br />     <br />      Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br />    is barbaric.<br />     <br />      No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />    a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />  our<br />    culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />    to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />    paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />    still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />     <br />      Regards,<br />      Senthil Raja<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K<br />     wrote: <br />       <br />        The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />        about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />        really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />        those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />        society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />        today, when compared with contemporary nations: <br />       <br />        1&#41; The Sati system<br />        2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />        garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />        3&#41; Untouchability & bad treatment of lower caste.<br />        4&#41; Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />        5&#41; Fate of widows<br />        6&#41; Marriage of girls to gods &#40; pottu kattutal &#41; & the<br />        devadasi system<br />        7&#41; Slavery<br />        8&#41; Marriage at childhood<br />        9&#41; Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />        10&#41; Suppression of mother tongues.<br />        11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />       <br />        But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />        main crux to be focussed.<br />       <br />        The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />        children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />        pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />        truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />        enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />        should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />        illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />        they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Friends, <br /><br />Probably much discussed topic in the recent past.<br /><br />Venkat's mails indicate : <br /><br />1. The British accomplished a Unified India.<br />2. Rulers prior to that - including Mohammedans & contemporary <br />Rajas - were still worse. <br />3. Detailed accounting on Mahatma Gandhi, his accomplishemtns and <br />assassination.<br /><br />Vijay- Veerasamy added : Comparison with Indonesia.<br /><br />It is London based Sridhar's views make me revisit this subject <br />again. His mail is put below for quick reference. I share his views.<br /><br />More or less he has covered all the aspects related to the topic.<br /><br />Sentil Raja's mails - with supporting links - definitely motivate us <br />to look at things from another plane.<br /><br />Satish added certain points.<br /><br />Ravi - emotional has taken certain (extra ) liberties in stressing <br />his view .. He is ardent Arunagiri Bakthar.. and in Business.. Knows <br />how to preseent things in a corum.<br /><br />In School books we have read of : <br />GUPTHAPPERARASU <br />MAGATHAPPERARASu<br /><br />Almost equivalent to this CHOZHAPPERARASU was established and was <br />functioning for about 80/85 years (985 to 1070 )in a span of about <br />400 years. <br /><br />During this period Bhojan and others ruled North. Gazni invasion .. <br />Mohammedan rule almost in the entire India.<br /><br />In-fighting among Rajputs paved way for Mohammedan rule and <br />subsequently the British rule..<br /><br />Same way infighting among Paalaykkarar's (there was hardly any king <br />in Southern India) when the British landed.. and Nawab of Arcot could <br />hardly resist.<br /><br />Anandarangam Pillai's diaries are discussing more of this time..<br /><br />This unification process snow-balled from the North to South.. Recall <br />the Leaders : Except Rajagopalachariar - Sathiamurthy - Kamaraj who <br />else was mentionable (Kodikaatha Kumaran - VOC - Bharathi did not <br />live to see the freedom movement unfying the Nation ).<br /><br />And Mahatma Gandhi was that force which retained that Unification <br />process.. which process could not be retained by any of his followers <br />including Nehruji.<br /><br />Take today's Tamilnadu ? Can we think of voicing anything in singular <br />voice? take this discussion : how many varying views. But Mahatma <br />could achieve this in the entire length and width of the Nation.<br /><br />Molasting the modesty of women or a Nation is common in any War..<br /><br />We have discussed extensively on patriotism earlier.<br /><br />Today Japanese automobiles - Arab Oil - Satellites by Grown nations <br />etc., etc., have become part and parcel of our life..<br /><br />We have been exporting BRAIN to the WEST ..<br /><br />We are seeing the Whites taking Idli - Vada in Kaiyendhibawans in <br />Chennai !<br /><br />Our guys are travelling in Tyoto Corella ..<br /><br />God has never been unkind to us.. and the scars are also getting <br />healed ..<br /><br />Very dense discussion ..

But, your generic &#40;&<br />  generous&#41; branding of our history as barbarious without british,  <br />is not<br />  only offensive, but of highly ill taste.<br />  <br />  I would like to know the morals in which you brand a thing as right <br />&<br />  wrong. Or, on what basis did you term those things as problematic <br />or<br />  barbaric.<br />  <br />  So, the basic question itself is not answered..<br />  <br />  By the way, in your own arguments, that we have to accept our <br />wrongs of<br />  ours.. Agreed.. But shouldn&#39;t we accept the atrocities, and <br />barbaric<br />  activities of the britishers too?<br />  <br />  What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong.. <br />but<br />  let&#39;s praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />  wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..<br />  <br />  I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..<br />  <br />  You are so easily terming sati &#40;which is almost voluntary &#41; as <br />barbaric,<br />  and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere <br />historic<br />  incident.<br />  <br />  You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet, <br />the Goa<br />  Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities <br />&#40;like<br />  inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front <br />of<br />  their husband&#41; by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to <br />you..<br />  <br />  You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree <br />the<br />  fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers <br />in<br />  Mumbai and calcutta... &#40;You might feel, the red-light prostitution <br />of<br />  mumbai would be better than devdaasi system&#41;..<br />  <br />  And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />  accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of <br />nun.. <br />  &#40;this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women <br />accepted<br />  god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances&#41;..<br />  And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in <br />Europe.. <br />  Would you term them as Barbaric? &#40;you may say it happens in <br />europe..<br />  but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also <br />the<br />  fact, that the nuns are produced & misused in india too&#41;<br />  <br />  <br />  So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />  history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />  negatives for our country?<br />  <br />  I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go <br />through<br />  those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />  vague opinionist argument.<br />  <br />  We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you.. <br />but<br />  in a term, based on true understanding of india. &#40;we are really<br />  becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />  mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media <br />controlled<br />  still by the colonial rulers&#41;<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Senthil Raja<br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    -Hi<br />    everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting<br />    personal or emotional about it.<br />   <br />    that was a long reply and befor vk replies i&#39;ll just like to add<br />    santayana&#39;s statement on history<br />   <br />    &#39;those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"<br />   <br />    just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a<br />    confident indian.<br />    its just hogwash.<br />    the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a<br />    problem.<br />   <br />    we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />    system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them <br />or<br />    placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.<br />   <br />    in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic <br />excesses<br />    in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />    its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />    patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />    i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in <br />his<br />    society and points out to them bravely.<br />   <br />    its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point <br />out.<br />   <br />   <br />    venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

But shouldn&#39;t we accept the atrocities, and<br />  barbaric<br />    activities of the britishers too?<br />   <br />    What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong..<br />  but<br />    let&#39;s praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />    wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..<br />   <br />    I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..<br />   <br />    You are so easily terming sati &#40;which is almost voluntary &#41; as<br />  barbaric,<br />    and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere<br />  historic<br />    incident.<br />   <br />    You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet,<br />  the Goa<br />    Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities<br />  &#40;like<br />    inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front<br />  of<br />    their husband&#41; by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to<br />  you..<br />   <br />    You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree<br />  the<br />    fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers<br />  in<br />    Mumbai and calcutta... &#40;You might feel, the red-light prostitution<br />  of<br />    mumbai would be better than devdaasi system&#41;..<br />   <br />    And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />    accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of<br />  nun..<br />    &#40;this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women<br />  accepted<br />    god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances&#41;..<br />    And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in<br />  Europe..<br />    Would you term them as Barbaric? &#40;you may say it happens in<br />  europe..<br />    but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also<br />  the<br />    fact, that the nuns are produced & misused in india too&#41;<br />   <br />   <br />    So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />    history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />    negatives for our country?<br />   <br />    I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go<br />  through<br />    those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />    vague opinionist argument.<br />   <br />    We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you..<br />  but<br />    in a term, based on true understanding of india. &#40;we are really<br />    becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />    mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media<br />  controlled<br />    still by the colonial rulers&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      -Hi<br />      everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting<br />      personal or emotional about it.<br />     <br />      that was a long reply and befor vk replies i&#39;ll just like to add<br />      santayana&#39;s statement on history<br />     <br />      &#39;those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"<br />     <br />      just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a<br />      confident indian.<br />      its just hogwash.<br />      the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a<br />      problem.<br />     <br />      we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />      system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them<br />  or<br />      placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.<br />     <br />      in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic<br />  excesses<br />      in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />      its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />      patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />      i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in<br />  his<br />      society and points out to them bravely.<br />     <br />      its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point<br />  out.<br />     <br />     <br />      venketesh</div></blockquote></div>
