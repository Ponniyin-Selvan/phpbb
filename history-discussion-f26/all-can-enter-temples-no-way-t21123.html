			<div class="content">Priya,<br /><br />Who exactly said beef-eaters cannot enter temples? The essence of<br />Hinduism lies in its openness and statements like yours only show the<br />world how irrational and narrow-minded its followers can be.<br /><br />I eat beef and I don't believe in the coventional idea of God. I am a<br />Hindu by birth and as I see Hinduism as a way of life(and not as an<br />organized religion), I have no problems in calling myself a Hindu.<br />The only reason I go to a temple(or a church or a synagogue for that<br />matter) is because I am interested in the historical and cultural<br />value that it has. Looking up at the Sistine Chapel(in Vatican) had<br />the same effect on me as looking up at the Thanjavur periyakoil<br />gopuram and I really hope everyone in this world gets a chance to<br />admire masterpieces like them and develop a respect for heritage<br />regardless of whether they are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or whatever.<br /><br />Veena<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I agree mostly with sridhar on periyar.But I cannot accept one<br />point<br />  of him at any cost.He says that hindu temples dont allow other<br />  religions people inside.Is that a fault?Is our temples just<br />heritage<br />  sites for anybody to enter and take fotographs?They are divine<br />  residences of god.<br /> <br />  Our temples are right in prohibiting people from other religions<br />  from entering into them.Christians and muslims eat beef.No<br />  problem,let them eat.But we dont want them in our temples.<br /> <br />  Even some hindus eat beef.But if they eat beef and enter<br />temples,its<br />  the issue between them and god.Its an issue between brothers of the<br />  same family.But we cannot extend it to others..But in no way can we<br />  allow others into the temples.<br /> <br />  Talking secualrism and pointing fingers on hinduism has become a<br />  fashion.why dont somebody question why in mosques only arabic is<br />  used?Why dont somebdoy question why non-muslims arent allowed into<br />  mosques?Can a non-muslims enter any mosque and come out alive?<br /> <br /> <br />  Allowing all religions into our temples is not secularism.Its<br />  treating temples as tourist sites.while personally you can beleive<br />  in god or not,millions believe in sancity of temples.we believe<br />that<br />  god lives inside.How can we allow beef eaters inside?No way.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">In all shastras it is said that impure people cannot enter<br />temples.What is narrow mindedness?Next somebody will drink liqour<br />and enter temple and call it as open mindedness.where is the limit?<br /><br />If you are a hindu and eat beef,welcome.Eat.Who stops you?Its a<br />democratic country.You have all rights to enter the temple.Nobody<br />stops you.You can eat beef in front of the temple,drink liqour in<br />front of temple and enter the temple.That is your right given by<br />constitution.We wont stop you.<br /><br />If you are a hindu you can treat hindu temples as tourist spots or<br />holy places.Thats your own will and wish.You can come into a temple<br />and enjoy it without praying.Just like how a muslim can enter a<br />mosque without praying.Irfaan pathan played cricket in a mosque when<br />he was a kid.But can a hindu do that in a mosque?Nopes.<br /><br />The issue here is 1)Do hindus have the rights to stop people from<br />other religions from netering their temples?<br /><br />answer is Yes.Since muslims are given freedom to refuse non-muslims<br />from entering into the mosque hindus too have such freedom.<br /><br />2)Can hindus ban beef eaters from entering into<br />temples?<br />Answer is Partially yes.They cannot refuse entry to a<br />hindu beef eater,but can refuse entry to a non-hindu beef<br />eater.Simple.<br /><br />You can look at thanjai periya gopuram with any artistic<br />view.Question is being a hindu can you enter kabba mosque and look<br />at it with an artistic view?<br /><br />why do you have different standards for different religions?</div>

			<div class="content">Priya,<br /><br />Let me say at the outset that I really have no wish to talk abt<br />religion here as<br />1. This is a literary forum and its not appropriate to talk about it<br />2. I am not known for being very tolerant of religious conservatism<br />So I will do this last post and I do not intend to write more about<br />this topic here.<br /><br />Narrow-mindedness is in interpreting religion to one's convenience<br />and thats exactly whats happening here. First of all, you are trying<br />to define pure and impure here by your own standards, or rather by<br />the Dark Ages, medieval standards. There are millions of people in<br />this world who just don't agree that eating beef or drinking is<br />impure. Your kind of thinking is exactly like the American electorate<br />thinking that they are being moral by voting for Bush because he is<br />anti-abortion(or anti-gay marriage) while they don't realize that<br />morality is not about not letting two men marrying but about killing<br />thousands of people in Iraq.<br /><br />According to you, just because I was born a Hindu, I can do anything<br />I want including murder in a temple while a Muslim cannot enter the<br />same temple even to stop me from murdering someone just because he<br />wasn't born a Hindu. Beautiful logic.<br /><br />And constitutional right? So tomorrow, if there's an amendment to the<br />Constitution that says that eveyone can enter the temple, you will<br />have no religious reservations against it? Please, lets not mix state<br />with religion here!<br /><br />And "Since muslims are given freedom to refuse non-muslims from<br />entering into the mosque hindus too have such freedom.". Firstly, no<br />one is denying that Hindus don't have the freedom - They have the<br />freedom and that is why you see so many signboards in every temple in<br />the country saying 'Hindus only'. The point we are trying to make is<br />that not letting anyone else in just does not make sense.

			<div class="content">as i myself have indicated i have no problem with a few of the grand<br />old temples being converted to tourist spots to showcase our<br />architectural capabilities<br /><br />but basically we have to bear in mind that a temple, church or<br />mosque is a religious place meant for our communion with god and as<br />such needs to be tretaed with reverence and not as a pure tourist spot<br />and there certainly needs to be a restriction on entry of non<br />believers in and around the sanctum sanctorum<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, sridhar rathinam<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Freinds<br />  I think there is fundamental misunderstanding and misconception<br />about our religeon and history here.....<br />  Unless We are clear in our mind about that there is no point in<br />discussing things further.<br /> <br />  Purity is in the mind Beleif is peoples mind....To quote Kannadasan<br />  Deiyvam enral athu deiyvam Adhu silai enral verum silai thaan....<br /> <br />  If you want people to restrict entry to temples to hindus whats the<br />next stage only vaishnavaits into perumaal thalams and vice versa....<br /> <br />  You can enter any Buddist temple in nepal,Thailand and Malaysia<br />they dont say you cant enter because you arent buddist secondly they</div></blockquote>know its their heritage and art that people admire if they dont<br />worship the lord....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Same in all the churches around the world...<br /> <br />  The religious edicts and symbols are our only link to our<br />heritage....Imagine if rajaraja had not built Big Temple He had not</div></blockquote>Built Gangai Konda Cholapuram would the world believe our engineering<br />skills 1000 years ago????No my freinds....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>One cant but admire our tamil kings particularly cholas because the<br />forts and palaces they lived were all of sengal and sunambu which</div></blockquote>goes away with time but they left behind himalayan proof of their<br />magnificance....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Yes Periyakoil feels like a tourist spot because you see all<br />colours and all religeons admiring the thakshina meru...but have you</div></blockquote>also noticed how many foreigners sit on the nandi mandapam to sketch<br />and paint the gopuram....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Theres a mystery park near interlakaen<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mysterypark.ch/index.html?&amp;page_id=47">http://www.mysterypark.ch/index.html?&amp;page_id=47</a><!-- m --><br />  does the picture at the top remind you of any thing....its our own<br />big temple.<br /> <br />  One of the reason we havent achieved the importance in<br />architechture and archeaology is because we wont let anyone other</div></blockquote>than hindus to enter the temples which are our only link to our past..<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Unless we do that all the world will know about tamil building<br />skills and temples is from the chola temple triad of Bigtemple.GKC</div></blockquote>and darasuram because they are UNESCO Heritage centres<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Regards<br /> <br />  Sri<br /> <br />  mangal95  wrote:<br /> <br />  i feel that a temple , church or mosque is meant for believers to<br />  relate to god in the way they visualise him and non believers have<br />no<br />  business to disregard the essential purpose for which they were<br />built<br />  and make it into a mere tourist spot - it certainly affects the<br />  sanctity of the place<br /> <br />  for example i do not feel the religious fervour when i enter the<br />big<br />  temple because it has become a torist spot and has thus lost part<br />of<br />  its sanctity and has become moe of an archaelogical site ha a<br />temple<br />  - given its uniqueness it probably cannot be helped but i will<br />  certainly not be comfortale with the same fate befalling all other<br />  old temples<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "veens_m" <br />wrote:<br />   <br />    Priya,<br />   <br />    Let me say at the outset that I really have no wish to talk abt<br />    religion here as<br />    1. This is a literary forum and its not appropriate to talk about<br />it<br />    2. I am not known for being very tolerant of religious<br />conservatism<br />    So I will do this last post and I do not intend to write more<br />about<br />    this topic here.<br />   <br />    Narrow-mindedness is in interpreting religion to one&#39;s<br />convenience<br />    and thats exactly whats happening here. First of all, you are<br />  trying<br />    to define pure and impure here by your own standards, or rather<br />by<br />    the Dark Ages, medieval standards. There are millions of people<br />in<br />    this world who just don&#39;t agree that eating beef or drinking is<br />    impure. Your kind of thinking is exactly like the American<br />  electorate<br />    thinking that they are being moral by voting for Bush because he<br />is<br />    anti-abortion&#40;or anti-gay marriage&#41; while they don&#39;t realize that<br />    morality is not about not letting two men marrying but about<br />  killing<br />    thousands of people in Iraq.<br />   <br />    According to you, just because I was born a Hindu, I can do<br />  anything<br />    I want including murder in a temple while a Muslim cannot enter<br />the<br />    same temple even to stop me from murdering someone just because<br />he<br />    wasn&#39;t born a Hindu. Beautiful logic.<br />   <br />    And constitutional right? So tomorrow, if there&#39;s an amendment to<br />  the<br />    Constitution that says that eveyone can enter the temple, you<br />will<br />    have no religious reservations against it? Please, lets not mix<br />  state<br />    with religion here!<br />   <br />    And "Since muslims are given freedom to refuse non-muslims from<br />    entering into the mosque hindus too have such freedom.". Firstly,<br />  no<br />    one is denying that Hindus don&#39;t have the freedom - They have the<br />    freedom and that is why you see so many signboards in every<br />temple<br />  in<br />    the country saying &#39;Hindus only&#39;. The point we are trying to make<br />  is<br />    that not letting anyone else in just does not make sense. You<br />have<br />    the freedom to do any kind of nonsense you want but you cannot<br />  claim<br />    it makes sense. And secondly, we do not have to compare ourselves<br />    with every other religion to do the right thing. When in school,<br />  you<br />    do not look at the guy who fails and say "hey, i won&#39;t study<br />since<br />    this guy doesn&#39;t". The idea it to look forward, not backward.<br />Note:<br />  I<br />    am not suggesting here that Islam is a backward religion, just<br />  saying<br />    that some of their rigid practices are definitely not forward-<br />  looking.<br />   <br />    Veena<br />   <br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "priya_vaishnava"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      In all shastras it is said that impure people cannot enter<br />      temples.What is narrow mindedness?Next somebody will drink<br />liqour<br />      and enter temple and call it as open mindedness.where is the<br />  limit?<br />     <br />      If you are a hindu and eat beef,welcome.Eat.Who stops you?Its a<br />      democratic country.You have all rights to enter the<br />temple.Nobody<br />      stops you.You can eat beef in front of the temple,drink liqour<br />in<br />      front of temple and enter the temple.That is your right given<br />by<br />      constitution.We wont stop you.<br />     <br />      If you are a hindu you can treat hindu temples as tourist spots<br />  or<br />      holy places.Thats your own will and wish.You can come into a<br />  temple<br />      and enjoy it without praying.Just like how a muslim can enter a<br />      mosque without praying.Irfaan pathan played cricket in a mosque<br />    when<br />      he was a kid.But can a hindu do that in a mosque?Nopes.<br />     <br />      The issue here is 1&#41;Do hindus have the rights to stop people<br />from<br />      other religions from netering their temples?<br />     <br />      answer is Yes.Since muslims are given freedom to refuse non-<br />  muslims<br />      from entering into the mosque hindus too have such freedom.<br />     <br />      2&#41;Can hindus ban beef eaters from entering into<br />      temples?<br />      Answer is Partially yes.They cannot refuse entry to<br />a<br />      hindu beef eater,but can refuse entry to a non-hindu beef<br />      eater.Simple.<br />     <br />      You can look at thanjai periya gopuram with any artistic<br />      view.Question is being a hindu can you enter kabba mosque and<br />  look<br />      at it with an artistic view?<br />     <br />      why do you have different standards for different religions?<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Veens_m<br /><br />" 1. This is a literary forum and its not appropriate to talk about<br />it<br />2. I am not known for being very tolerant of religious conservatism"<br /><br />Literature devoid of religion loses its<br />spirit.Seperate religion from tamil literature and see what<br />remains.Nothing.And accusing me of being a religious conservatist is<br />like accusing an atheist of being an atheist.Is being a religious<br />conservatist a sin?I dont think so.<br /><br />"Narrow-mindedness is in interpreting religion to one's convenience<br />and thats exactly whats happening here. First of all, you are<br />trying to define pure and impure here by your own standards, or<br />rather by the Dark Ages, medieval standards. There are millions of<br />people in this world who just don't agree that eating beef or<br />drinking is impure."<br /><br />I never interpreted hinduism according to my<br />convenience.Ahamas and shastras define the way temples should be<br />run.Nobody can comeup with their own version of running a<br />temple.Temples were built by kings who were staunch devotees and who<br />wanted them to uphold the vedic tradition.For thousands of<br />generations they were run in that way.They are for the believers and<br />will be for the believers.Calling them as dark age standards doesnt<br />degrade them.One man one wife was also a ramayan age standard.Do we<br />give it up since its old?No.<br /><br />everyone can have their versions of<br />purity.Being in usa,i everyday move around with beef eaters and<br />people who drink.I dont mind people doing it.But when it comes to<br />temples,its not my view or anyones view thats important.The ithegas<br />and ahama shastras should be followed there.<br /><br />"Your kind of thinking is exactly like the American electorate<br />thinking that they are being moral by voting for Bush because he<br />is anti-abortion(or anti-gay marriage) while they don't realize<br />that morality is not about not letting two men marrying but about<br />killing thousands of people in Iraq."<br /><br />Where do you draw the line my friend?next somebody will<br />ask for freedom to marry their own mother and sisters.Somebody will<br />want permission to marry an animal.There has to be a line<br />somewhere.Americans drew that line as they wanted it to be.<br /><br />"According to you, just because I was born a Hindu, I can do<br />anything I want including murder in a temple while a Muslim cannot<br />enter the same temple even to stop me from murdering someone just<br />because he wasn't born a Hindu. Beautiful logic"<br /><br />The debate was not about DOING THINGS INSIDE<br />TEMPLE.Its about doing things outside temple.Many murderers have<br />entered temples.Many criminals enter temples.Nobody stops that as<br />long as they are hindu.<br /><br />"And constitutional right? So tomorrow, if there's an amendment to<br />the Constitution that says that eveyone can enter the temple, you<br />will have no religious reservations against it? Please, lets not mix<br />state with religion here"<br /><br />There are many ways in which hindu temples are hurt<br />today.Allowing movie shootings inside the temples,allowing actresses<br />who are impure bilolgically to enter temples for shootings,allowing<br />love scenes,duet scenes inside temples...<br /><br />If hindus are taken for granted like this no wonder<br />BJp gets so many votes.<br /><br />"The point we are trying to make is that not letting anyone else in<br />just does not make sense. You have the freedom to do any kind of<br />nonsense you want but you cannot claim it makes sense. And secondly,<br />we do not have to compare ourselves with every other religion to do<br />the right thing"<br />Make sense to who?Who is that authority to whom<br />we should make sense?Who is that deciding authority of what makes<br />sense and what doesnt?Should we design our temple rules to make<br />sense to people who dont believe in god?<br /><br />Religion is sentimental.Its not logical.If you<br />search for logic and science in religion you are mistaken.Its about<br />faith.Its about faith in god and the holy book.All religions are run<br />that way.And how do you say that what you think is the right thing<br />and what I think is wrong?I believe in the sancity of vedas.Millions<br />of hindus do.If you want to come up with your version of right and<br />wrong,then dont expect us to adhere to your belief.Temples were<br />built to uphold vedic dharma and they should remain that way.<br /><br />"When in school, you do not look at the guy who fails and say "hey,<br />i won't study since this guy doesn't". The idea it to look forward,<br />not backward. Note: I am not suggesting here that Islam is a<br />backward religion, just saying that some of their rigid practices<br />are definitely not forward-looking.<br /><br />Thats a very clever note to put in.</div>
