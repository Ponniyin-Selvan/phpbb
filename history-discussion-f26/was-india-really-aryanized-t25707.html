			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by raj kumar  using id elangojana</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Hi all,<br /><br />Is it possible to give proof for an incident that<br />took place before BC? Some theories will not have<br />proof and we have to accept that according to our<br />knowledge.<br /><br />Thiruvalluvar lived just before 2030( appr. )<br />years. According to vikram's sentences that time this<br />nation was already aryanized. So we should not refer<br />Thirukkural.<br /><br />As Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the extensions of<br />Aryan culture, if you refer these, then its like<br />seeing from 'aryan arena'.<br /><br />Coming to the Gods' matter , all Gods are not came<br />from Aryan culture. They mingled the local Gods with<br />their own Gods and stories.<br /><br />For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God, and was<br />worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of aryans.<br />Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans named<br />that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of Rama<br />and Krishna. According to one theory these people were<br />Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As in<br />olden days, kings were treated as 'Avathar of God' and<br />they became real Gods.<br /><br />Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />Harappa and Mohandharo ( now a days north india and<br />Pakistan ) and Aryas came from Central Asia and when<br />they met there was a clash between them. In that clash<br />that civilization was ruined and dravidians came back<br />to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came into<br />entire india and established their culture without<br />war.<br /><br />These things did not take place in a single day. It<br />took several hundred years. If realize that, then you<br />can understand that. This is mostly - world wide<br />accepted theory.<br /><br />This is not given in that theory. This is my own<br />opinion : As Sanskrit is their own language ( what<br />they spoke when they were in Central asia ), they dont<br />want to let it die. So (unintentionally - unknowingly)<br />they love and say that as a devine language and try to<br />keep that in existance in anyway( Thaan adavittalum<br />than sathai aadum? ). Its like even after settled-down<br />in America/Britain we celebrate Pongal as we dont want<br />to give-up our own culture fully.<br /><br />Coming to Color of Gods, Some 'Vaithega Madangal'<br />not yet accepted some Gods and Godess in Tamilnadu (<br />One famous Godess also in that list ). I dont want to<br />say that explicitly.<br /><br />These Aryan - dravidian theory exists even before<br />the period of British. So its childish to blame them<br />in this matter.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Rajkumar.G.<br /><br />--- sri  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi All,<br /> <br />  here is one link:<br /> <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/aryan/aryan_frawley.html">http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/a ... awley.html</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  I think this Aryan Invasion theory was created by<br />  British to defend themselves<br /> <br />  1. even in the oldest of Tamil literature like<br />  Thriukural, we find references to Hindu Gods&#40;Aryan&#41;.<br /> <br />  2.If u take Mahabaratha, u have reference to Pandya<br />  Kings.<br />  3.Light-skinned and dark-skinned is not a matter.<br />  Krishna is represented as a dark skinned ,Godesss<br />  Parvathi/Kali is dark-skinned and so are<br />  Arjun,Draupadi etc.In many families, it is possible<br />  that people are dark-skinned.<br /> <br />  Yes, if Aryans came from Central Asia, is there any<br />  proof or aracheaological evidence?<br /> <br />  What are the views of others?<br /> <br /> <br />  ---vijay.kmr@...wrote:<br /> <br />    I have a very very basic question haunting me for<br />  a<br />    long time.

			<div class="content">I have one doubt about this theory. In all our literatures or our puranas we never had any mention of people having any&nbsp;clash with some other race. Supposing, a war&nbsp;happened which pushed dravidians to the south, it is strange it&nbsp;finds no mention of any sort&nbsp;(ok..ok..as far as i know).&nbsp;<br />Look at this way?. Say Sanskrit is the native language of Aryans when they were in central asia (refer rajkumar?s mail). Any culture would take pride in mentioning the victory they have achieved in their literature. Again no mention of any victories in Upanishads. Only victories that were mentioned are those against asuraas.

Some theories will not have<br />    proof and we have to accept that according to our<br />    knowledge.<br />   <br />    Thiruvalluvar lived just before 2030&#40; appr. &#41;<br />    years. According to vikram&#39;s sentences that time<br />    this<br />    nation was already aryanized. So we should not<br />  refer<br />    Thirukkural.<br />   <br />    As Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the extensions<br />    of<br />    Aryan culture, if you refer these, then its like<br />    seeing from &#39;aryan arena&#39;.<br />   <br />    Coming to the Gods&#39; matter , all Gods are not<br />  came<br />    from Aryan culture. They mingled the local Gods<br />  with<br />    their own Gods and stories.<br />   <br />    For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God, and<br />    was<br />    worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of<br />    aryans.<br />    Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />    dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans named<br />    that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of<br />  Rama<br />    and Krishna. According to one theory these people<br />    were<br />    Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As in<br />    olden days, kings were treated as &#39;Avathar of God&#39;<br />    and<br />    they became real Gods.<br />   <br />    Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />    Harappa and Mohandharo &#40; now a days north india<br />  and<br />    Pakistan &#41; and Aryas came from Central Asia and<br />  when<br />    they met there was a clash between them. In that<br />    clash<br />    that civilization was ruined and dravidians came<br />    back<br />    to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came<br />    into<br />    entire india and established their culture without<br />    war.<br />   <br />    These things did not take place in a single day.<br />    It<br />    took several hundred years. If realize that, then<br />    you<br />    can understand that. This is mostly - world wide<br />    accepted theory.<br />   <br />    This is not given in that theory. This is my own<br />    opinion : As Sanskrit is their own language &#40;<br />  what<br />    they spoke when they were in Central asia &#41;, they<br />    dont<br />    want to let it die. So &#40;unintentionally -<br />    unknowingly&#41;<br />    they love and say that as a devine language and<br />  try<br />    to<br />    keep that in existance in anyway&#40; Thaan<br />  adavittalum<br />    than sathai aadum? &#41;. Its like even after<br />    settled-down<br />    in America/Britain we celebrate Pongal as we dont<br />    want<br />    to give-up our own culture fully.<br />   <br />    Coming to Color of Gods, Some &#39;Vaithega<br />  Madangal&#39;<br />    not yet accepted some Gods and Godess in Tamilnadu<br />  &#40;<br />    One famous Godess also in that list &#41;. I dont want<br />    to<br />    say that explicitly.<br />   <br />    These Aryan - dravidian theory exists even<br />  before<br />    the period of British.

If sanskrit is the native<br />language of India why its not spoken by the people.<br /><br />If it is really a devine language, how come<br />ordinary people happened to know that. do they<br />indirectly mean that they are superior?<br /><br />Ok, we accept that sanskrit as a devine language.<br />Then they have no communication problem with god.

They mingled the local Gods<br />  with<br />    their own Gods and stories.<br />   <br />    For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God, and<br />    was<br />    worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of<br />    aryans.<br />    Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />    dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans named<br />    that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of<br />  Rama<br />    and Krishna. According to one theory these people<br />    were<br />    Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As in<br />    olden days, kings were treated as &#39;Avathar of God&#39;<br />    and<br />    they became real Gods.<br />   <br />    Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />    Harappa and Mohandharo &#40; now a days north india<br />  and<br />    Pakistan &#41; and Aryas came from Central Asia and<br />  when<br />    they met there was a clash between them. In that<br />    clash<br />    that civilization was ruined and dravidians came<br />    back<br />    to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came<br />    into<br />    entire india and established their culture without<br />    war.<br />   <br />    These things did not take place in a single day.<br />    It<br />    took several hundred years. If realize that, then<br />    you<br />    can understand that. This is mostly - world wide<br />    accepted theory.<br />   <br />    This is not given in that theory. This is my own<br />    opinion : As Sanskrit is their own language &#40;<br />  what<br />    they spoke when they were in Central asia &#41;, they<br />    dont<br />    want to let it die. So &#40;unintentionally -<br />    unknowingly&#41;<br />    they love and say that as a devine language and<br />  try<br />    to<br />    keep that in existance in anyway&#40; Thaan<br />  adavittalum<br />    than sathai aadum? &#41;. Its like even after<br />    settled-down<br />    in America/Britain we celebrate Pongal as we dont<br />    want<br />    to give-up our own culture fully.<br />   <br />    Coming to Color of Gods, Some &#39;Vaithega<br />  Madangal&#39;<br />    not yet accepted some Gods and Godess in Tamilnadu<br />  &#40;<br />    One famous Godess also in that list &#41;. I dont want<br />    to<br />    say that explicitly.<br />   <br />    These Aryan - dravidian theory exists even<br />  before<br />    the period of British. So its childish to blame<br />  them<br />    in this matter.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Rajkumar.G.<br />   <br />    --- sri  wrote:<br />   <br />      Hi All,<br />     <br />      here is one link:<br />     <br />   <br /> <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/aryan/aryan_frawley.html">http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/a ... awley.html</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I think this Aryan Invasion theory was created<br />  by<br />      British to defend themselves<br />     <br />      1. even in the oldest of Tamil literature like<br />      Thriukural, we find references to Hindu<br />    Gods&#40;Aryan&#41;.<br />     <br />      2.If u take Mahabaratha, u have reference to<br />    Pandya<br />      Kings.<br />      3.Light-skinned and dark-skinned is not a<br />  matter.<br />      Krishna is represented as a dark skinned<br />  ,Godesss<br />      Parvathi/Kali is dark-skinned and so are<br />      Arjun,Draupadi etc.In many families, it is<br />    possible<br />      that people are dark-skinned.<br />     <br />      Yes, if Aryans came from Central Asia, is there<br />    any<br />      proof or aracheaological evidence?<br />     <br />      What are the views of others?<br />     <br />     <br />      ---vijay.kmr@...wrote:<br />     <br />        I have a very very basic question haunting me<br />    for<br />      a<br />        long time. Was<br />        India Aryanized. I started reading the book<br />      "History<br />        of South India" by<br />        K.N Sastry and he has written that South India<br />    was<br />        Aryanized from 1000<br />        B.C to 400 B.C. Also in my school days we have<br />      read<br />        that Aryans as such<br />        were not Indians and they came from Central<br />  Asia<br />    /<br />        Europe. How true is<br />        this Theory? If these people came from central<br />      Asia<br />        and Europe, why<br />        isn&#39;t there any trace of these people today in<br />      those<br />        places.<br />       <br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br />=====<br />BREAK THE RULES<br />AND STAY BEYOND THE LIMITS.<br /><br />RAJKUMAR.G.<br />II M.Tech (CSE),<br />101 Brahmaputra Hostel,<br /><acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology">IIT</acronym> Madras,<br />Chennai-36.<br />phone - (0)98404-50630<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Tired of spam?
