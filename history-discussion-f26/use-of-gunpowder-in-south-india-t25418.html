			<div class="content">Hi Arun<br /><br />my info is very elementary. but I think it warrants a better study <br />which we shall do in the coming weeks.<br /><br />but this greek fire the predecessor of gunpowder( where one sprays <br />naptha and ignites it on ships) was a real fearsome ammunition <br />considering hulls of wood and sails of cloth.<br /><br />I think the real work on gun based warfare started in the new roman <br />empire in constyatinople.<br /><br />when mongols invaded delhi wassaf and khusro dont even mention sucha <br />weapon. they take pains to even describe the arrow proof siilk <br />underwear the mongols wore. they woulndt have missed this.<br /><br />after the mongols came only malik visited south india. he didnt use <br />the weapon either.<br />so the first prize goes to babar. lodi was surprised at the weapon <br />and his elephants bolted at the thunder.<br /><br /><br />just wondering. if I as an individual had just one machine gun and <br />unlimited ammunition I could have conquered the chola chera and <br />pandyas.<br /><br />thats the power of technology.<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun <br />Krishnan"  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venketesh,<br />  <br />  Great work.
