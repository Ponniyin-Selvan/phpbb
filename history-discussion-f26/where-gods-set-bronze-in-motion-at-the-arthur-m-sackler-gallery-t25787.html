Â— An exhibition at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery <br />here, "The Sensuous and the Sacred: Chola Bronzes From: South India," <br />doesn't waste much time. Its opening salvo, unleashed within mere <br />yards of the entrance, consists of three spectacular bronzes of the <br />Hindu god Shiva as Nataraja, Lord of Dance. In each, Shiva balances <br />on his right leg while crooking his left up and across his body, <br />communicating the sense of imminent motion Â— be it a spin across the <br />heavens or a tremor of devotion Â— that animates all great Indian <br />sculpture.<br /><br />His famous dreadlocks are already fanning out from his head like an <br />undulating musical score. His poised body is framed by a large <br />hooplike aureole called a prabha, which is at once the circle of life <br />and a ring of fire. After all, Shiva's dance is one of cosmic force <br />that destroys and then recreates the world. Even the nonspecialist is <br />likely to suspect that these astounding presences add up to the kind <br />of artistic confab that curators and scholars of Indian art yearn for.<br /><br />Indeed. The dancing Shivas, lent by museums in Dallas and Amsterdam <br />and an unnamed private collector, lead off a succession of works, <br />many of which are well known and widely reproduced, that are rarely, <br />if ever, seen in one another's company. A collaboration between the <br />Sackler and the American Federation of Arts, this exhibition has been <br />organized by Vidya Dehejia, a professor of art history at Columbia <br />University and formerly the chief curator and deputy director of the <br />Sackler. It is the first in the United States to concentrate solely <br />on the bronze temple sculptures created during the nearly four-<br />century reign of the devout, munificent and innovative Chola <br />emperors. <br /><br />The Cholas ruled the South Indian region of Tamil Nadu, which centers <br />on the holy river Kaveri and the city of Tanjore, from the middle of <br />the 9th century to the late 13th century. At times, they expanded <br />this empire to include Sri Lanka and the Maldives and sent emissaries <br />as far as China. They built ever larger and more elaborate temples <br />festooned with stone images of gods, goddesses and their acolytes; <br />these were thriving centers of faith as well as of devotional dance, <br />music and poetry. Each Chola temple contained a sanctum closed to all <br />but select priests, within which dwelt the primary, emblematic but <br />nonfigurative image of the god to whom the temple was dedicated Â— <br />usually either Shiva or Vishnu, foremost among the numerous Hindu <br />gods, all of whom are representatives of a higher unseen being.<br /><br />In an egalitarian impulse that seems intrinsic to Hindu <br />heterogeneity, the idea that the gods should be accessible without <br />priestly mediation had been gaining strength for some time. "The lord <br />comes within everyone's reach" is how the great ninth-century Tamil <br />poet-saint Nammalvar put it. The Chola rulers began commissioning <br />bronze versions of the temples' stone depictions of the gods' <br />different earthly incarnations Â— called avatars. A single temple <br />required multiple images of its primary god, like Shiva as Lord of <br />Dance, Destroyer of Three Cities and Seductive Mendicant. <br /><br />Unlike their stone counterparts, these bronze images were portable. <br />Seen as living incarnations of the gods, they were ritually bathed <br />and fed, and then clothed in lavish fabrics, jewels and flowers; they <br />were carried through the streets like earthly rulers, as part of <br />either elaborate festivals or daily rituals.<br /><br />This tradition fostered, and was fostered by, the refinement of a <br />sophisticated lost-wax casting process, which had not yet been <br />rediscovered in the West. Soon the components of a golden age were in <br />place: until around 1250, when a period of political disintegration <br />and violence began, the Chola oversaw a period that ranks among the <br />world's high points of figurative sculpture, bronze-casting and <br />religious tolerance.<br /><br />It would not be an overstatement to say that these sculptures are <br />among the most beautiful ever made, in any material. There are 56 <br />here and they easily overcome the first requirement of any Sackler <br />show: distracting viewers from the depressing reality of a museum <br />that is mostly underground, nearly devoid of natural light and <br />plagued by a confusing missile-silo layout. The sculptures' <br />transporting combination of formal perfection, religious gravity and <br />life-affirming alertness can make the setting all but disappear.<br /><br />The show offers a reasonably full contingent of gods, goddesses and <br />saints that outlines the Hindu firmament. Shiva and Vishnu appear in <br />several different incarnations. In other works, Shiva is accompanied <br />by his consort, Uma (known as Parvati in northern India). In the <br />show's three "Somaskanda" images, he appears with Uma and their son <br />Skanda. Uma, for her part, is present as the war goddess Durga or as <br />the fierce Kali. The fabulously full-bodied, elephant-headed Ganesh, <br />another son of Shiva and Uma, is also here, then as now one of the <br />most popular forms for both Hindu believers and sculptors. There is a <br />spectacular figure of Uma as the 10th-century Chola Queen Sembiyan <br />Mahadevi, one of the dynasty's first and greatest patrons. (The <br />bronze dancing Shiva form was an innovation of her workshops.) Also <br />represented are several of the Tamil poet-saints, the sometimes <br />humble, sometimes noble beings whose spontaneous poems became part of <br />the temple liturgy under the Chola.<br /><br />From: the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., comes its <br />famous Mother of Karaikkal, an ancient ascetic whose upright skeletal <br />form nearly vibrates with religious fervor. From: the Cleveland Museum <br />of Art, there is a serene yet forceful image of Vishnu as his lion-<br />man avatar, Yogi Narasimha, sitting in a yoga position, his legs <br />folded in front of him (and encircled by a yoga band) two of his four <br />elbows resting on his knees. Basking in the radiance of this <br />extraordinary being, it is pertinent to recall that muddled <br />descriptions of animal-headed, multiarmed figures like this caused <br />Europeans to demonize Indian sculpture, contributing mightily to its <br />art-historical neglect.<br /><br />While this exhibition will undoubtedly help specialists establish <br />dates and provenance in royal and regional workshops, the <br />opportunities to make stylistic and iconographical distinctions can <br />be enjoyed by anyone. Consider, for example, the changing <br />proportions, from elliptical to full-circle, of the Shiva Lord of <br />Dance aureole, or the varying postures and expressions of the <br />squirming dwarflike figure on which he stands. (That is Mushalagan, <br />who represents darkness and ignorance.) Consider, too, the way the <br />limbs of some figures curve and swell, while others are relatively <br />straight; the way shoulders are sloped or exaggerated in width; the <br />way some girdles seem almost part of the flesh Â— as in the <br />Metropolitan Museum of Art's pair of small images of Shiva and Uma, <br />for example Â— while elsewhere they encase the figure almost like <br />armor.<br /><br />To Hindu worshippers, these extraordinary objects existed only at <br />extremes, as either cosmic substance or dumb matter: they were either <br />enlivened by the god's spirit or, once the rite or procession was <br />over and the god had departed, they were an inanimate piece of <br />household metal that needed to be vigorously and unceremoniously <br />scrubbed before being resanctified. They were neither viewed nor <br />fetishized as art. In fact, they were barely seen at all, given the <br />amount of paraphernalia heaped upon them for their public outings.<br /><br />Even so, visual contact Â— called darshan, which literally translates <br />as "seeing and being seen by God" Â— is the essential form of Hindu <br />religious experience, the moment of blessing. In fact, eye contact is <br />so essential that if an image's eyes were worn away by touching or <br />cleansing, they were usually recarved into the face Â— as is the case <br />with several works here. In addition, Hindu belief dictates that <br />inner beauty and grace be reflected on the outside: beauty of form, <br />proportion, gesture, expression and detail.<br /><br />Nothing Â— not an angle of a palm or the bend of a finger Â— is <br />without meaning, devoid of symbolism or purely decorative. Shiva's <br />earrings are always mismatched, to represent men and women. But with <br />or without a deep understanding of Hinduism and its elaborate <br />symbolism, these works communicate a beauty that is at once <br />profoundly human and formally radical. It has everything do to with <br />seeing.<br /><br />The Indian sculptors, in particular the Chola bronze sculptors, <br />negotiated a truce between geometry and the organic, the abstract and <br />the realistic, that is almost unknown to Western sculpture. The <br />Egyptians achieved something similar, but they never set it in <br />motion. This Indian sculpture, influenced by dance, was able to do. A <br />kind of ecstatic clarity of living form resulted, expressed in the <br />continuous play between taut curving lines and smooth curving planes.<br /><br />No matter what angle you view them from, the Chola bronzes at the <br />Sackler almost invariably present the viewer with a simultaneous <br />sense of crisp profile and a soft volume that adds up to an <br />extraordinary sense of unity, of seeing everything at once in a <br />microcosmic flash of revelation.<br /><br />LINK:http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/06/arts/design/06SMIT.html<br /><br />Arthur M.
