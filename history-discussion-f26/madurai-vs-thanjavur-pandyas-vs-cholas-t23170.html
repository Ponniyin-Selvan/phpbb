			<div class="content">I'd like to comment on this...<br /><br />As I live in Chennai, I can find lot of ppl not using the Public Toilets, because it is not maintained properly, (also, bcos of water scarcity). Of course, the ppl who r using the toilets also should use it properly. Itz the blame of both the ppl as well as govt.<br /><br />As Ramakrishnan points out, the reason mainly is due to the ppl in Chennai. There are lot of slums in Chennai. Govt. has to make those ppl to realise that every thing is public property. When compared to B'lore, in this regard, Chennai is very far behind.<br /><br />The ppl will think as 'this is our country' after their basic needs (Fud, Clothes and Shelter) are satisfied. But a lot of ppls still sleep in Road Side (like Charlie character in Anniyan), how can we expect cleanliness from them???<br /><br />Seenu.<br /><br />Venkateswaran Kasirajan  wrote:<br />One can exercise his freedom of existance by urinating<br />on a temple wall ( or for that matter, any public<br />place ) but others have their rights to atleast inhale<br />pure air, right?<br /><br />Anyone reading "Kathavilasam" in AnandaViketan?

			<div class="content">Why just put the blame on people who don't use the toilets. Haven't we<br />thrown waste papers / plastic covers just like that on the road. Myself<br />and a couple of my friends did take a new year resolution in 2000 not to<br />throw waste papers / covers on the road. Don't know how many of them are<br />following. Atleast I follow it. So let us start from us instead of<br />pointing the finger at the low end people.<br /><br />Seenu wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I&#39;d like to comment on this...<br /> <br />  As I live in Chennai, I can find lot of ppl not using the Public<br />  Toilets, because it is not maintained properly, &#40;also, bcos of water<br />  scarcity&#41;. Of course, the ppl who r using the toilets also should use<br />  it properly. Itz the blame of both the ppl as well as govt.<br /> <br />  As Ramakrishnan points out, the reason mainly is due to the ppl in<br />  Chennai. There are lot of slums in Chennai. Govt. has to make those<br />  ppl to realise that every thing is public property. When compared to<br />  B&#39;lore, in this regard, Chennai is very far behind.<br /> <br />  The ppl will think as &#39;this is our country&#39; after their basic needs<br />  &#40;Fud, Clothes and Shelter&#41; are satisfied. But a lot of ppls still<br />  sleep in Road Side &#40;like Charlie character in Anniyan&#41;, how can we<br />  expect cleanliness from them???<br /> <br />  Seenu.</div></blockquote></div>

Even Coimbatore. Yes, my folks settled<br />      there after their retirement<br />      and although I have been pleasantly struck by the<br />      respectful tamil that the<br />      people speak, the really parochial attitudes<br />      especially towards women that<br />      is present in Tamizh Nadu as a whole really<br />      irritates me. I compared<br />      Coimbatore to a place like Mysore &#40;where my wife<br />      grew up, although she is a<br />      Tamil too&#41; and I was completely amazed by how<br />      intellectually vibrant,<br />      liberal and all embracing a place Mysore was.<br />      Although Coimbatore is a<br />      bigger place than Mysore, there is an attitude of<br />      small mindedness about it<br />      that is decidedly rural. And having studied in<br />      Karaikudi, I can say that<br />      this is a general attitude in Tamizh Nadu<br />      &#40;reinforced by the likes of<br />      Rajnikanth and other Kollywood idols with their male<br />      chauvinistic movies&#41;.<br />      Maybe we should try and change our attitudes first<br />      along with rejoicing over<br />      our glorious heritage <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />     <br />      Cheers,<br />     <br />      Arun<br />     <br />      On 7/19/05, Sivakumar K.N. <br />      wrote:<br />       <br />        This is in response to Vijay&#39;s email.<br />       <br />        I do not know about Madurai but putting Coimbatore<br />      and Chennai in the<br />        same basket is a big joke. Language, which<br />      reflects the nature of a<br />        person, can be compared to understand the<br />      difference.<br />        e.g.: In Coimbatore, you will not find a single<br />      auto/taxi/bus<br />        driver/conductor to address a customer in<br />      singular. We know the polish<br />        and cultural depth of the madras baashai!!<br />       <br />        I guess it is due to the huge floating population<br />      of Chennai. I do not<br />        think it is correct to take Chennai to be a true<br />      reflection of the<br />        great Tamil culture simply because it is modified<br />      to a great extent<br />        &#40;price for prosperity !!&#41; . Just like Mumbai<br />      cannot be a mirror of<br />        Maharashtra.<br />       <br />        Moments when I read about the Tamil Sangham of<br />      Madurai, read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and<br />        walked inside the Periya Kovil made me proud of<br />      the lineage I have<br />        inherited.<br />       <br />        The fact that the kings built stronger temples<br />      &#40;which might have<br />        served as the cultural center of that village - I<br />      have seen Swiss<br />        villages built around the church&#41; that stood the<br />      test of time/invaders<br />        but not-so-stronger forts/palaces for themselves,<br />      indicates the<br />        benevolent attitude of our kings to OUR people.<br />       <br />        Regards<br />        Siva<br />        On 7/19/05, rojatraders <br />      wrote:<br />          Even Europe was never united.Every European<br />      country fought many wars<br />          with each other &#40;including two world wars&#41;.Tamil<br />      kings too did the<br />          same thing.<br />         <br />          As far as pandyas and cholas are concerned<br />      cholas attained some<br />          glory during the period of vijayalaya&#39;s<br />      dynasty.comparably pallavas<br />          had the simma vishnu dynasty.Pandyas had their<br />      great kings like<br />          maravarman sundara pandyan.Cholas and pallavas<br />      immortalized their<br />          regimes with mahabalipuram and thanjai Periya<br />      koil.Pandyas did<br />          nothing of that sort.<br />         <br />          Venkatesh said "perhaps the gods are busy<br />      holding their noses from<br />          the stink and just dont have a free hand to<br />      kill."<br />         <br />          God doesnt kill anybody for urinating.If our<br />      child urinates in the<br />          wall of our house,will its father kill that<br />      child?<br />         <br />          regards<br />          sampath<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Yahoo!
