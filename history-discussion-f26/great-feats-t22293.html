He<br />    asked for five arrows, and shot four of them simultaneously in<br />four<br />    directions in the sky. A raven flying high up momentarily found<br />its<br />    way blocked everywhere. Then he shot his fifth arrow and brought<br />    down the confused raven.

This technique finds its parallel in a very ancient<br />    archery episode portrayed in the longest and the greatest Indian<br />    epic, Mahabarata. In this epic, Arjuna, the master archer, is<br />    required to employ the strategy of aiming at the eye of a target<br />    fish rotating above his head by viewing its reflected image<br />below in<br />    water; of course, all this to win the hand of a beautiful<br />princess!<br />    Arjuna is so trained that he cannot but excel in focusing his<br />    attention on his target. A comparative study of the laparoscopic<br />    surgeon and the ancient master archer is done in this paper with<br />a<br />    view to throwing light on the interesting similarities between<br />the<br />    archer and the modern laparoscopic surgeon with respect to<br />training<br />    methods, skills, and techniques.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "Sivapathasekaran"<br />   <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "Vijay Kumar .S"<br />       wrote: <br />     <br />      Nice.<br />     <br />      Rahul and Vijay,<br />     <br />      In Pudukkottai Museum, the KAVASAM of Kattabomman & Co., &#40;<br />Steel<br />      knitted dress&#41; almost 7 feet tall is displayed !

			<div class="content">On the contrary our mentality has been to accept anything said without proof<br />as long the source sounds convincing. We are learning to be less naive. In<br />some issues it hurts people as it affects generations of belief. Tamil or<br />Indian mentality is not denying pride but questioning the right to it. I<br />dont see anything wrong in it.<br />Some time back in our group there was a small argument about the language<br />spoken during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s time (hope im right). It came to a very inconclusive<br />end. And if it weren't for the British in the 1800's we would still be<br />thinking <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>built Big Temple. thats completely laughable!!<br />Instead being blinded by emotions we need to take constructive steps to<br />prove ourselves right. We need to question ourselves before the world starts<br />to do it. Anybody who doesn't want to hear it is not mature enough for this<br />argument.<br />Madan questioned this and was labelled everything just short of traitor. I<br />would love it if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was The Greatest...just tell me why? Because he built<br />a Big Temple, he conquered Srilanka, presence of Chola coins and kalvettus<br />in far off lands might suggest trade, etc. come on people, you can do<br />better.<br />Mr.Venketesh often gives an example of the piece of fabric describing "The<br />Battle of Hastings".<br />One more thing is there enough data on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> to write a biography of 300<br />pages?<br />Everytime this argument crops up somebody ends it by saying there is a lot<br />of data not shown to public viewing describing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as the greatest.<br />Atleast this time show something conclusive which will shut this once and<br />for all.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />On 9/8/07, sridhar rathinam  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay<br />  That was a great response...humour or no humour Rahuls response mirrors<br />  most Indian or Tamil mentality I cant possibly do this if he has done this<br />  hes lying....Sorry that why we rae in the current state we are in...<br />  Kind regards<br />  Sri<br />  *"Vijay Kumar .S" * wrote: <br /> <br />  dear rahul<br /> <br />  you did well by clausing your initial statement...for humor sake.

This technique finds its parallel in a very ancient<br />      archery episode portrayed in the longest and the greatest Indian<br />      epic, Mahabarata. In this epic, Arjuna, the master archer, is<br />      required to employ the strategy of aiming at the eye of a target<br />      fish rotating above his head by viewing its reflected image<br />  below in<br />      water; of course, all this to win the hand of a beautiful<br />  princess!<br />      Arjuna is so trained that he cannot but excel in focusing his<br />      attention on his target.

			<div class="content">History can be tampered for some time to meet selfish needs but eventually will spring up as time moves on.<br />British had the power that point in time, they have certainly made many valuable contributions. However they have tampered enough with our history and religion to suit their needs (this is no surprise). They are responsible world over to have created instability and dividing people. You seem to be saying they constructed bridges and railways to promote indian facilities to help poor indian people <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> au contraire, it was for reaching remotest parts of the country and to conquer and plunder. They were no better than Ghajini or Gori. Only difference is Gori's and gajini's had no idea of ruling the country, the birts were in for the long haul. They systematically ripped us giving bread crumbs. We have not got anywhere for 50 - 60 yrs from where they left.<br />Compare today's india vs todays england. After world war II they were brought to knees by their Nazi neighbors and India was by their ruling counters. Brits had positioned a puppet govt in India, strengthened their commerce and... ensured that they got the funds from us where we were left with corrupt politicians and so on .. so forth. Their tube alone makes a difference, vs our railways.<br />There is no harm in feeling the patriotic edge, I am an indian and it pains me every time to see the kohinoor on the crown. Infact, India should sue England for its possesion of indian valuables.<br />Nyayama partha, england valarchikku india panam kuduthirukku, so we need our ROI asap <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />If I can have my India back with its blossom as discoveries in science and leading the world instead of having poverty and crooked politics, damn, I will be happy to take Karikalan as the builder of Big temple.

A comparative study of the laparoscopic<br />    surgeon and the ancient master archer is done in this paper with<br />a<br />    view to throwing light on the interesting similarities between<br />the<br />    archer and the modern laparoscopic surgeon with respect to<br />training<br />    methods, skills, and techniques.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "Sivapathasekaran"<br />   <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "Vijay Kumar .S"<br />       wrote: <br />     <br />      Nice.<br />     <br />      Rahul and Vijay,<br />     <br />      In Pudukkottai Museum, the KAVASAM of Kattabomman & Co., &#40;<br />Steel<br />      knitted dress&#41; almost 7 feet tall is displayed !

The<br />northernmost atoll was Minicoy, called Maliku Atholhu. The country <br />was said to consist of<br />Malikadduu demedhu; meaning "the islands between Maliku and Addu <br />Atolls". The cultural and<br />historical affinities can be seen in the language, oral traditions, <br />customs and most of all from the<br />close relationships and inter-marriages between families of Minicoy <br />islanders and Maldivians.<br />Between the tenth and twelfth centuries A.D., the Chola King <br />Rajaraja I captured the two<br />northernmost atolls of Maldives, Maliku Atoll (Minicoy) and <br />Thiladhummathi. These two atolls<br />remained under the Cholas until 1121 when King Mahaabarana of the <br />Theemuge dynasty defeated<br />the Cholas, and brought them under Maldivian sovereignty <br />(Shihabuddine c. 1588-1658). According<br />to present information, Minicoy remained part of Maldives from then <br />on until the early sixteenth<br />century, when the island passed into the hands of the ruler of <br />Cannannore.</div>
