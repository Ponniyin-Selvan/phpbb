			<div class="content">Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as<br />compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -<br /><br />* Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards<br />this event and the author would have supported one side - portraying<br />the other as the evil force. Kalki's own <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is no exception to this.<br /><br />But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will<br />be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />(refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is the<br />murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why when<br />you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too at<br />the end of 5th volume !<br /><br />* Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero Â– but in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) becomes a<br />hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted Arulmozhi<br />to be recognized as a hero in his novel Â– the name Ponniyin<br />selvan is<br />derived from him Â– but an `all perfect' figure he<br />portrayed only<br />helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology of<br />events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi Â– who is a character in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />and<br />Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> Paranjothi character is used to<br />introduce many characters in the Novel Â– but the real hero is<br />Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar<br />technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own creator !<br /><br />* Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in<br />timeline (invariably). For example, in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> the last part happens after<br />a gap of 9 years. But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> portrays events continuously for a period of<br />6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out who<br />was doing what for almost every day Â– for a period of 6 months.<br /><br />* Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur Â– and yet Â–<br />with master<br />craftsmanship Â– will link them in a very logical order Â– as<br />pages<br />move byÂ…<br /><br />* Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />researched topic<br /><br />* This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds of<br />love between human beings portrayed Â–<br />- Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other since<br />their first sight.<br />- Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />Amudhan<br />- Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />vanathi<br />- Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi<br />- Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali<br />- Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />- Aditya's love towords Nandhini<br />- Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini<br />- Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini<br />- Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan<br /><br />Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, two<br />sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do Â– given the<br />wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays<br /><br /><br />* <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> has different heros at<br />different points of timeÂ…<br />- In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />- In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />- In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />- Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he becomes<br />royal heir etc)<br />- During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />Thus it is close to real life in which different people become heros<br />at different points of time.<br /><br />* Surprise ! <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> seems to have no villains ! (or rather everybody seem<br />to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a villi but<br />after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ? Remember<br />Â–<br />they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect their<br />leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />cruelty of Pandiya's murder Â– this can be understood.<br />In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with possible<br />realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.<br /><br />I initially though of writing a small mail Â– but this is close to<br />becoming an article. I can write many things like thisÂ….and yet<br />may<br />not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />historic novel ever written.<br /><br />Your comments are welcome.<br />Cheers !<br />Gokul.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi gokul,<br /><br />Am newly joined member of this group.<br />While going through the previous mails and conversations,<br />i came across this mail ... as you said its not just a mail,<br />but ofcourse its a wonderful article about <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />A preface for that great novel.<br />After reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, i decided that i should make my children also read <br />it and want them to make ardent lovers of kalki and his novels.<br />But, always i have a doubt, that the generation gap .. <br />they may show a disinterest, if i suddenly gave them a historic <br />novel to read...<br /><br />after reading the novel, am damn sure that kalki will make them fall <br />in his writing spells... but before reading i should take careful <br />steps to bring their interest towards the novel. <br /><br />Now you have taken care of it... i will take a copy of this article <br />and ask them to read this first.. this will surely draw their <br />interest in reading kalki novels.<br /><br />Good work<br />regards,<br />Lavanya<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Gokul.S"  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as<br />  compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -<br />  <br />  * Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />  kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards<br />  this event and the author would have supported one side - <br />portraying<br />  the other as the evil force. Kalki&#39;s own <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is no exception to <br />this.<br />  <br />  But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will<br />  be evident that the novel does&#39;nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />  felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />  &#40;refer his conclusion to the novel&#41; - to many readers it is the<br />  murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why <br />when<br />  you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />  dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too <br />at<br />  the end of 5th volume !<br />  <br />  * Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero Â– but in<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />  a small, insignificant and noble warrior &#40;Vandhiyathevan&#41; becomes a<br />  hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted <br />Arulmozhi<br />  to be recognized as a hero in his novel Â– the name Ponniyin<br />  selvan is<br />  derived from him Â– but an `all perfect&#39; figure he<br />  portrayed only<br />  helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology <br />of<br />  events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />  compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi Â– who is a character in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />  and<br />  Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> Paranjothi character is used to<br />  introduce many characters in the Novel Â– but the real hero is<br />  Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar<br />  technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own <br />creator !<br />  <br />  * Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in<br />  timeline &#40;invariably&#41;. For example, in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> the last part happens <br />after<br />  a gap of 9 years. But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> portrays events continuously for a period <br />of<br />  6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out <br />who<br />  was doing what for almost every day Â– for a period of 6 months.<br />  <br />  * Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />  places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />  time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />  Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur Â– and yet Â–<br />  with master<br />  craftsmanship Â– will link them in a very logical order Â– as<br />  pages<br />  move byÂ…<br />  <br />  * Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />  researched topic<br />  <br />  * This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds <br />of<br />  love between human beings portrayed Â–<br />  - Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other <br />since<br />  their first sight.<br />  - Poonguzhali&#39;s love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />  Amudhan<br />  - Arulmozhi&#39;s interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />  vanathi<br />  - Vanathi&#39;s love towords Arulmizhi<br />  - Amudhan&#39;s love towords Poonguzhali<br />  - Nandhini&#39;s love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />  - Aditya&#39;s love towords Nandhini<br />  - Parthibendhran&#39;s love towords Nandhini<br />  - Pazhuvettaraiyar&#39;s interest in Nandhini<br />  - Manimekalai&#39;s love towords Vandhiyathevan<br />  <br />  Initially I thought of categorizing them &#40;like one sided love, two<br />  sided love etc&#41; but I find that it is difficult to do Â– given the<br />  wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays<br />  <br />  <br />  * <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />  dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> has different heros at<br />  different points of timeÂ…<br />  - In Pallipadai events &#40;Part I&#41; Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />  - In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />  Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />  - In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />  - Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />  Part IV and V &#40;During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he <br />becomes<br />  royal heir etc&#41;<br />  - During the aftermath of floods &#40;Part IV&#41;, Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />  certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />  Thus it is close to real life in which different people become <br />heros<br />  at different points of time.<br />  <br />  * Surprise ! <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> seems to have no villains ! &#40;or rather everybody <br />seem<br />  to have enough justifications&#41; Nandhini might sound like a villi <br />but<br />  after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />  reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ? <br />Remember<br />  Â–<br />  they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect <br />their<br />  leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />  undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />  cruelty of Pandiya&#39;s murder Â– this can be understood.<br />  In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with <br />possible<br />  realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.<br />  <br />  I initially though of writing a small mail Â– but this is close to<br />  becoming an article. I can write many things like thisÂ….and yet<br />  may<br />  not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />  historic novel ever written.<br />  <br />  Your comments are welcome.<br />  Cheers !<br />  Gokul.</div></blockquote></div>

This is my opinion.<br />   <br />    At the end of reading the last chapters and when<br />  i turned back the<br />    long way I came through, reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and<br />  recollected the incidents,<br />    my mind was filled with so many astonishments.<br />  Within such a short<br />    duration ... it involves so many turning<br />  points... only he &#40;kalki&#41;<br />    can do this... no one else ...<br />   <br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Lavanya<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Gokul.S"<br />  <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      Dear Lavanya<br />     <br />      As time goes, I&#39;m finding newer and newer<br />  things which Kalki has<br />      capitalized.<br />     <br />      One thing which I forgot to mention was the way<br />  he had made use of<br />    all<br />      the various festivals - beginning from Aaadi<br />  padhinettu. I went<br />    thro<br />      the tamil calender and found out that as the<br />  novel progresses, he<br />      makes use of various auspicious days - some are<br />  mentioned in the<br />      passing while some are featured in great<br />  detail. For example, the<br />      birthday of krishna, aandal thirunakshatram and<br />  even a day when the<br />      lord comes to Ketilam river.<br />     <br />      On a comparison, these techniques are missing<br />  in Paarthibhan Kanavu<br />      and Sivakamiyin sabadham<br />     <br />      Rgds<br />      Gokul.S<br />     <br />     <br />        Hi gokul,<br />        i came across this mail ... as you said its<br />  not just a mail,<br />        but ofcourse its a wonderful article about<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />        A preface for that great novel.</div></blockquote><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Looking for last minute shopping deals?<br />Find them fast with Yahoo!
