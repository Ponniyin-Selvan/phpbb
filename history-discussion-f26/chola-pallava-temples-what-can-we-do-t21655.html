			<div class="content">Dear Chandra,<br /><br />I also second ur thoughts..i have a reason for that..yesterday, i was travelling through vadapalani..and i saw a very old temple(deity-vengirswarar)..but i was pained to see that the walls of the temple were cluttered with film posters and the place surrounding the temple was full of urine. The walls of the temple have lost their paint..i at once wanted to bring this to the attention of our group members asking them for their advice as to what needs to be done, so that we put a stop to this kind of defiling of the sanctity of our temples..im surprised to find only that our temples are defiled..not even a single mosque or church meets this fate..why is this? I also feel that it is the hindus themselves who do this atrocity..centuries back, people kept the temples clean out of mainly fear of invoking the wrath of god..but now people have lost that fear..<br />also i would like to mention that in the thiagaraja temple in Tiruvarur(my native), there is a well called mookuthi kinaru..supposedly kamalambika's nose stud is inside this well..but if one looks inside that well, you will be in for a shock..lots of slippers,plastic covers..what not..i felt ashamed of myself of being a hapless, apathetic creature..but i want to change this..for this i am ready to donate whatever i can..lets start with a small dot and try to make a big beautiful kolam out of that..

			<div class="content">Dear Chandra and Mouli,<br />These same thoughts have been bothering me for a long time. The more i see,how people take care of their monuments in the U.S, the more ashamed i become. I have been thinking about this for a long time and actually have a plan in mind. The reason the temples were taken care of in the olden days wasbecause of contributions not just from the king but from the common man too. While exploring different ideas i stumbled upon DHAN in Madurai that uses internet to get contributions to renovate Ooranis. They use internet to reach people who live abroad and still want to maintain their roots. In our case, anyone who is interested can contribute towards a temple in memory oftheir loved ones. Can there be any better memorial than a commemorative plaque (future Kalvettus!!) at the temple site. Since we already have a organizational set up in REACH this seems a possibility. Follow the link for more about DHAN project and see how we can adopt it for our purpose. The gentleman who maintains the Goodnewsindia website will probably be interested in our cause and may even post our cause in his website which has a good readership.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.goodnewsindia.com/index.php/Supplement/article/512/P1/">http://www.goodnewsindia.com/index.php/ ... le/512/P1/</a><!-- m --> <br />People who live abroad like me can popularize this cause with their friendsand people visiting temples near their areas. With 989 members and counting we already have a great network of people in our group. It might seem like a small number but remember when this group was started all we had was 10 or 12 members and we have grown this far. Please let me know if REACH would interested in such a project and the idea could be developed further with participation from eminent brains in this group.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Arulprasad<br /><br /><br />To:  ponniyinselvan@...: mailmouli_27@...: Mon, 4 Sep 2006 08:44:08 -0700Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Chola & Pallava temples - what can we do?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Chandra,<br /> <br />I also second ur thoughts..i have a reason for that..yesterday, i was travelling through vadapalani..and i saw a very old temple(deity-vengirswarar)..but i was pained to see that the walls of the temple were cluttered with film posters and the place surrounding the temple was full of urine.
