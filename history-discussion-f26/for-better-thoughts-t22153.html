			<div class="content">Thanks Naren for Echoing my sentiments...<br /><br />The other think I notice in the Vathapi Vinayagar article was the<br />unneccessary use of Vadamozhi(Sanskrit) in it.I shouldnt object<br />because I have a Shri in my name....<br /><br />But if we criticize people for being addicted to western cultures and<br />use of english language...then using Sansrit letters is equally<br />critizizable<br /><br />But it comes from the tallest order of Tamil hindu Clergy but still a<br />error is an error isnt it<br /><br />Sri</div>

			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />Interesting topics with lots of inputs...learners delight...shall I<br />say.I am stunned by the flow of mails. An average of 15 mails per<br />day. I find it difficult to just read and corelate the<br />conversations..truely a learners delight.<br /><br />Cholas conquering the himalayas..why its not possible??? When<br />conquering lands across seas like Lanka, sumatra, java, etc were<br />possible, why not Himalayas, is my question. Just think of those<br />days, 1000 years back, when no means of communication was there.<br />cholas went in 100s of ships to unseen lands and conquered them. If<br />that is possible, I think conquering Himalayas is quite easy, because<br />its all through the lands and only ganges in between, which is<br />nothing compared to the vast oceans they already conquered. Again, as<br />already pointed out in this group, tamil culture is very old that we<br />have mention of pandian kings in the mahabaratha war. I have some<br />more info. All accept that ramayana is much older than Mahabaratha,<br />quite a 100 years or even 1000s of years. In Bala Kandam of Ramayana,<br />while teaching Rama, Lakshmana, Bhartha and chatrugna, Vishvamitra<br />tells them about the greatness of Lord Muruga. Again, in Kishkintha<br />kandam, when Anuman first meets Rama, he thinks that Rama is as<br />beautiful as Lord Muruga. We all know, Lord Muruga is very much<br />related to Tamil and tamil nadu and if Ramayana has mention about<br />Lord Muruga, then we can assume that Tamil and Tamil culture can be<br />older than Ramayana..isnt it great???<br /><br />Coming to the topic of our history being destroyed by western style<br />of education...well mathavaramanan, a very good mention of those. I<br />feel this awareness is slowly picking up. Indina culture and history<br />is not what we read and think what it is. it is not limited to just<br />2500 BC starting with the aryans. The crux of the story is...<br /><br />The Europeans,especailly the Britishers thought that they were the<br />supreme and their growth is the best in the world. But when they<br />stumbled upon India and came to know about the richness and the<br />greatness of the country, they faced a nosecut. They were not able to<br />digest the greatness of India, its vedas, its upanishads, its rich<br />knowledge and the great history. They wanted to project that<br />everything started from the west and hence formed the Aryan Invasion<br />theory. As we all read, aryans were westerners who invaded India and<br />came in from the west, through the gulf region. The actual meaning<br />of 'Arya' in sanskrit is 'Learned','cultured' man and it never meant<br />a race, as its used today. Its also said that these facts were<br />insisted by some available evidences like harappa and mohanjodaro<br />excavations and some imaginary theories like aryan invasion etc. Its<br />a pity that no true Indian has ever written the History of India and<br />only the Europeans wrote the History of India, which we read today.<br />Even if Some India writes Indian History, its all based on the<br />writing of the Europeans.<br /><br />Any logical thinking can show that, all these vedas, upanishads,<br />puranas, kavyas, all the literary works, the rich culture, tradition,<br />rituals, beliefs, practices, way of life, architecture, ...do you<br />think all these can be accomplished in such a short span of time..ie.<br />2500 years. And if Harappa and Mohanjodaro are were the first<br />civilisation which started around 2500BC, is it possible for such a<br />great nation to achive so much excellence with so varied culture and<br />tradition within 2000 years or so. We have ample proof that by 500BC -<br />1AD or so we have good civilized society, Ashoka the great, Buddha,<br />Adi sankara, sangam literature, Mahavira, Chandragupta maurya, etc<br />etc etc.....is all these possible in just 2500 years? We all know<br />that Islam came to India some 1000 years back. Even after 1000 years,<br />if there is no unity between Hindus and Muslims in India, how come<br />its possible for such a vast civilization in India, in different<br />regions, with different language, different religion to live in<br />Harmony, in just 2500 years after the first civilization. Though<br />today we say Hindus, it was only Adi sankar who united all the<br />sanathana dharma sects into one. Earlier saivites were fighting with<br />vaishnavites, and buddists were fighting with jains, and so and so<br />forth. We had atlest four religions then. Taking all this into<br />account, its impossible to restrict the first civilization to 2500<br />bc.How idiotic?<br /><br />THE REASON : As highlighted earlier, the Europeans wanted to prove<br />their dominance and distorted Indian History. Britishers were good at<br />divide and Rule and hence divided the society based on Religion,<br />caste and creed. They wanted to prove their dominance always and so<br />restricted the age of vedas to around 2000bc. And we blind Indians<br />never questioned it and blindly followed it. Any opposing feelings<br />were suppressed. And thus we have the so called History today<br />distored, and people divided by caste and creed and hatred all along.<br />Even after Independence due to various political benefits this was<br />not corrected. Thanks to the communists and the erstwhile congressmen<br />who contributed to it..Nehru in his Discovery of India has said that,<br />without the Muslim Rulers, Indian art and architecture would not have<br />flourished. I think he never visited any part of India to see<br />masterpeices like Brahadeeswara temple in Tanjavoor or the Somnath<br />Temple or the Puri Jagannath temple or the Sun Temple of Konark and<br />so on so forth. So with the full support of such western patriots,<br />our culture was further tarnished.<br /><br />The communists never wanted anything to flourish and always opposed<br />to anything related to the Hindu culture. With anti-brahminical<br />sentiments the history was distored. I think casteism is at its worst<br />only in the past 100-200 years. And since all the vedas and<br />upanishads were considered to be written by Brahmins, these western<br />patrons never gave them the due respect.<br /><br />The story in Tamil Nadu is no differet. Here again the Dravidian<br />movement which is inturn an anti-brahminical movement did the same to<br />distort our history and tradition. As Priya rightly said, all the<br />tamil literary works were related to Relion and the dravida kazhagams<br />never gave them the due respect.<br /><br />I strongly feel that such caste distaste is prevailing only for the<br />past 200 years or so. As rightly pointed out in <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kamakoti.com">http://www.kamakoti.com</a><!-- w -->, the<br />varnasrama never paved way for dishormony in the society for 1000s of<br />years, but breaking this system, we are no more united only in the<br />past few 100 years..i would say from the day the europeans came into<br />India.<br /><br />A lot about this has been written by the french journalist<br />Mr.Francois Gautier and his works can be read at<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.francoisgautier.com/mywork.htm">http://www.francoisgautier.com/mywork.htm</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />I think such forums where learned people discuss can create a<br />renaisance and bring out our real history to the forefront, and<br />revitalise the lost glory and pride.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Sri,<br /><br />Nice that messages crossed the 5000th mark and membership nearing 500.<br /><br />Thanks for your mails.<br /><br />Re Westernisation, I was opting for more inflows on the historical side of<br />Kanmdradithan or so. However, re compairing in TV, hardly any originality.<br />Priya was a trend setter in early years of telecast. Accent, dress,<br />modulations west-imitated, but content "Manmatharaasa... ". I was opining<br />only on this.<br /><br />Re Rehman's song .. yeah .. it is good to go around South at this part of<br />time and enjoy green pastures.<br /><br />Re Himalayan conquor etc., I agree these things would have taken place and<br />really would have been amazing. Kudavoil wrote an article in Kumbakonam<br />Mahamaham special issue titled "Aavi mudal THAAVI varai ". - quoting a<br />Thevaram of Thirunavukkarasar - interpreting that the "Thavi" was really "<br />Jammu Thaawi" and tried to establish that Thirunavukkarasar really<br />visited "Mount Kalailash" (as shown in Thiruvarutchelvar movie - played so<br />well by Chevlr.Sivaji) !<br /><br />It was also said that from Srivillipurthur to Madurai "Bell Towers" were<br />constructed & spaced so that Thirumalai Nayak took food after<br />hearing "Uchikaala" bell of offerings to Aandaal.<br />That was a codified way of communication. Like wise any such method was<br />followed in those days by the Kings to send and receive important messages -<br />was my inquisiteness. Kalki writes of "Owling " " Lighting of flame-<br />torches " (Like striking matches in Robert Ludlum's novels) being some<br />forms of communications.<br /><br />Re young New Members, very good mails are flowing regularly which are rich,<br />informative and enjoyable. As we used to discuss, they are going to be the<br />Torch Bearers of our Rich and Valuable Traditions in the Centuries to come.<br /><br />When we are really talking of Globalisation now - as (Sir) Sri pointed out<br />rightly - communicating in the English language - aryanisation etc., should<br />be looked at from broader perspectives ... As Meenakshi wrote of<br />Vandhiyathevan - Kundavai meet in the 23rd Century sometime back - thanks<br />to Marathadi - there are possibilities of our becoming mere NUMBERS and<br />LANGUAGES becoming Dots / Codes ! May be we are in a cycle already.<br /><br />fondly, sps</div>

			<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />As Mr Satish and Ms Piriya have been mentioning that<br />Tamil literature works greatly related to religion.<br /><br />Because of anti-religious Dravidan parties these texts<br />have not been getting its prominance especially after<br />congress rule in TN,about 35 years ago.<br /><br />These party leaders change their names to pure Tamil<br />names like Nedunchezhian etc targetting only Hindu<br />names but they do not mind in names like Shahul Hameed<br />or Stalin or Peter Alphonse.They do not want names<br />from north india but they accept names from Arabia or<br />western countries. (this is just to point out their<br />indifference, no intent to hurt any members of other<br />religion)<br /><br />Even so called pure Tamil party's leader name and<br />their party symbol "Udaya sooryan' are sanskrit<br />names.Forget about their TV's name etc.Are their sons<br />and grand children are studying in Tamil medium while<br />they advocate every thing to be in Tamil?<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________<br />Yahoo!
