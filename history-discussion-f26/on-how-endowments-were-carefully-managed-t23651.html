			<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />Read an inscription found by Dr.Rajamanickanar institute of Historic<br />research in Pullamangai Thiru Alanthuraiyar temple (Near Kumbakonam).<br /><br />It belongs to 24th regional year of Rajaraja.<br /><br />The king had made few of the lands tax free (Iraiyili) since they<br />were belonging to odhuvars (Nindrothum sattap peru makkal) in his<br />12th regional year. In 24th year he found that there was no<br />thiruppatiyam chanting happening - there were no odhuvars available.<br />Probably the inspecting officer should have observed this and<br />silently made an observatory remark - so the king issued a royal<br />order to take away the iraiyili and make it taxable land.<br /><br />This inscription throws a rare glipmse of how endowments provided to<br />temples were not only audited but were even taken back when the<br />purpose was not served.<br /><br />Given their rudimentary infrastructure, it is amazing to see the<br />quality of governance.<br /><br />Anbudan<br />G</div>

This was MUTHARAYARs town as mentioned in<br />earlier mails. Two years back I came to know that it is THIRUVALLAM -<br />located near Ranipet / <acronym title="Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited">BHEL</acronym> Township - from where Vandhiyathevan<br />hailed. Kundavi & Vthvn ruled together from this place after their<br />wedding. MELPADI (Western Command) is hardly 10 Kms away -where in<br />his 30th Rgnl Yr - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> constructed Arinjayeswaram (Pallippadai) in<br />memory of his grand father Arinjayan - probably the LAST of the<br />temple he constructed in his 30 yrs span of Rule. Most of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s<br />inscriptions in Big Temple denote his 29th Rgnl Yr.<br /><br />In the Thiruvallam temple, inscriptions mention of one MADURANTAKA<br />KANDRADITHAN (who is supposed to be the son of Uthama Chozha.)His<br />inscriptions are not found after 997 AD (according to Sethuraman). He<br />was incharge of auditing the temple accounts in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s Rule and had the<br />authority to punish those who mismanaged the temple funds / affairs.<br /><br />At the entrance of the sanctum, statue of a person is seen in the<br />sitting posture with both his hands NAILED to the floor!<br /><br />Inscriptions mention that he was punished by MADURANTAKA KANDRADITHAN<br />on behalf of the Emperor - for having misused temple funds!<br /><br />There are similar instances in Suseendram, Nagerkoil etc.<br /><br />Another thing : Dr. Jaybee has mentioned in the Agathiyar Group that<br />in the Siva Temple of (Ponnamaravathi Thirupathur) T. Vairavanpatti<br />(not the one near Pillayarpatti), inscriptions of Rajaraja in his 3rd<br />Regnl Year are found in VATTEZHUTU - which was normally found in<br />Pandyas' days only! Spoke to Dr. Kkvn last night.. He was also<br />thrilled and needed more information ..<br /><br />Fondly, sps<br /><br />Fondly, sps</div>

In Raja raja's case, it was Aadi Punarvasu 985 AD- which was<br />amavasya day this year! 3rd Regnl yr of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> means, 3rd yr after Aadi<br />punarvasu of 985... The same date would have been different for a<br />Pandya king in terms of his Regnl yr.. Subsequently Sakha Calender<br />started figuring in inscriptions...<br /><br />Re Thiruvallam, it is evident that Kundavai & Vdthvn ruled over from<br />there after their wedding.. Probably he was the C-in-C of Western<br />Command (Melpadi) - supporting <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s daughter Kundavi + Vimaladithan<br />of W.Chalukyas. Rajendra was Nothern Commander stationed at<br />Thiruvottiyur. Eastern would have been Poompuhar or Nagai and<br />Southern is at Nagerkoil / Suseendram.<br /><br />Banas @ Vanars may be from Rayalaseema. But that should have been<br />their dynasty's birth place.<br /><br />Kudanthai jothidar .... is elderly person ... Krupa has to speak in<br />matured voice ...<br /><br />Fondly, SB</div>
