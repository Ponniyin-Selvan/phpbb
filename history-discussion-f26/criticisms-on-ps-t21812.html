			<div class="content">All<br /><br />I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. This book <br />takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of Kanaiyazhi (1964-<br />74) and the selection is by Asokamitran. <br />There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's style <br />of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. Apparently <br />this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode 300 and <br />301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a piece of <br />the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the <br />episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking about the <br />literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. <br />Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured by the <br />romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my college <br />days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely). <br />For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading it <br />doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are those of us <br />who got interested in their history but I think the percentage is <br />much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in <br />looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont read, <br />say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do that I <br />will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for the <br />sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the soul, I <br />will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'. <br />One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of <br />thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the mocking words <br />by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the novel 'Sivagami <br />ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing remark <br />criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the escapism in <br />life.<br /><br />The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by singanallur ramaswamy  using id singanallur ramaswamy </span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />The criticism that Kali's writings and historical romances are escapist fares are nothing new. They are age-old. But my point is who are guys like asokamitran to decide on the literary status of a novel. It's upto the readersto decide on this. And talking of Moha Mull, I have tried to read it any no of times but was unable to go beyond page two. What do you have to say about this. All I, and many readers for that matter, look forward to is an interesting story, well-told. Criticisms can go to hell, for all I care!<br /> <br />Ramaswamy<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br />To: ponniyinselvan@...:mprakas@...: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:32:03 +0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Criticisms on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />AllI was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'.

			<div class="content">My question is this<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>What, if any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?</div></blockquote><br />Hi Muthu<br />you do raise thought provoking quesions.<br /><br />I think first you ought to define what a piece of literature is.<br />if only the works of salman rushdie and vikram seth are considered <br />literature what about "twinkle twinkle little star."<br />in fact it is read by more people, remembered longer and has a much <br />more impact on us.{how bad we felt when humpty dumpty couldnt be put <br />together again, or when jack( of jill fame) broke his crown.}<br />in a movie we are shown scenarios visually and thats why either most <br />people like it or most people dont like it.<br />very little left for the movie goer to visualise in his mind.<br />but definitely - a piece of literature will not be judged alike by 2 <br />people. i think it stirs some emotions deep down in the heart for <br />some and it doesnt for others. that would evoke differing reactions <br />and different visualisations.<br />most successful writers like archer have traced that success formula. <br />if you read archers twist in the tale or quiver full of arrows we <br />would definitely see something in common with us. the same formula <br />was used by r.k narayan. a mischievous boy, a nagging wife, etc.<br /><br />satires are rib tickling. dont we see satires on the most succesful <br />movies ever coming on television. of course we have enjoyed the <br />movies and now enjoy the satires too. its the creativity behind both <br />that appeals to us.<br /><br />venketesh</div>

			<div class="content">One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub everyone <br />else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a inferior <br />feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with the <br />reading itself.<br /><br />"Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail clearly. He <br />just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where this <br />guy is. And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good novels <br />depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the great <br />novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing him <br />actually shows ignorance. <br /><br />Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If you <br />cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' or 'Moga <br />mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway depletes the <br />place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br /><br />By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> but has <br />read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to read <br />even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not make <br />anything great or add any literary value. <br /><br />Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not hold <br />good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br /><br />Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />literature is, I would think any good literature to record life as <br />it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. Ofcourse, <br />this is one person's view. What say you?<br /><br />The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value of <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br /><br />Do answer the question without going into rage against Asokamithran, <br />Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai.

Probably thats because of a <br />inferior <br />    feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with the <br />    reading itself.<br />    <br />    "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />clearly. <br />  He <br />    just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />    asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />  this <br />    guy is. And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good novels <br />    depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />great <br />    novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing him <br />    actually shows ignorance. <br />    <br />    Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />you <br />    cannot read past two pages of &#39;Oru puliyamarathin Kathai&#39; <br />or &#39;Moga <br />    mull&#39;, that is understandable but that does not anyway depletes <br />  the <br />    place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />    <br />    By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> but <br />  has <br />    read &#39;Paradise lost&#39; completely &#40;which I find it difficult to <br />read <br />    even the title page&#41;. Thus, &#39;easier to read&#39; criteria does not <br />  make <br />    anything great or add any literary value. <br />    <br />    Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not hold <br />    good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />    assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br />    <br />    Coming back to Venkatesh&#39;s point that we need to define what <br />    literature is, I would think any good literature to record life <br />as <br />    it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />Ofcourse, <br />    this is one person&#39;s view. What say you?<br />    <br />    The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value of <br />    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />    <br />    Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />  Asokamithran, <br />    Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br />    <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  wrote:<br />     <br />      I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai.

I read three fouth of that <br />  book, <br />    but<br />      couldn&#39;t appreciate why it is known as the best book ever <br />  written. <br />    Probably<br />      I am not in the same plane of connoisseurs<br />      <br />      ~ Udanx<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      On 8/20/07, singanallur ramaswamy  wrote:<br />       <br />        Hi,<br />       <br />        The criticism that Kali&#39;s writings and historical romances <br />  are <br />    escapist<br />        fares are nothing new. They are age-old. But my point is who <br />  are <br />    guys like<br />        asokamitran to decide on the literary status of a novel. <br />It&#39;s <br />    upto the<br />        readers to decide on this. And talking of Moha Mull, I have <br />    tried to read it<br />        any no of times but was unable to go beyond page two. What <br />do <br />    you have to<br />        say about this. All I, and many readers for that matter, <br />look <br />    forward to is<br />        an interesting story, well-told. Criticisms can go to hell, <br />  for <br />    all I care!<br />       <br />        Ramaswamy<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        ------------------------------<br />        To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />        From: mprakas@<br />        Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:32:03 +0000<br />        Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Criticisms on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />       <br />       <br />        All<br />       <br />        I was reading a collection of stories from &#39;Kanaiyazhi&#39;. <br />This <br />    book<br />        takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />Kanaiyazhi <br />    &#40;1964-<br />        74&#41; and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />        There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan&#39;s <br />  style<br />        of writing called &#39;Mazha naatu magudam&#39; by Nagupoleon. <br />  Apparently<br />        this is his only story. The story is two episodes &#40;Episode <br />300 <br />    and<br />        301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />piece <br />  of<br />        the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />        episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />  about <br />    the<br />        literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />        Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />by <br />  the<br />        romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />    college<br />        days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />        For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading <br />it<br />        doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />those <br />    of us<br />        who got interested in their history but I think the <br />percentage <br />  is<br />        much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in<br />        looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />read,<br />        say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to do <br />  that <br />    I<br />        will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for <br />  the<br />        sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />  soul, I<br />        will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />        One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />        thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the <br />mocking <br />    words<br />        by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />  novel &#39;Sivagami<br />        ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This scathing <br />  remark<br />        criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />    escapism in<br />        life.<br />       <br />        The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply <br />call <br />    this<br />        between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose <br />to <br />    call<br />        it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group. My question is this<br />       <br />        What, if any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />       <br />        Muthu Prakash R<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        ------------------------------<br />        Check out some new online services at Windows Live IdeasÂ—so <br />  new <br />    they<br />        haven&#39;t even been officially released yet.
