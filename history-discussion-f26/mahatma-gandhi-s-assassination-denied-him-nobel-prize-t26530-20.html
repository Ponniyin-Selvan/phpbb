Gandhi&#39;s impact was not just the freedom<br />  struggle it is world over, the principle of non violence and passive<br />  resistance is too valuable to be throw under the foot as nothing.<br />   <br />    I dont&#39; have any problem discussing Gandhi but we do so with <br />respect -<br />  say I don&#39;t understand this and that of what he did. Fine.

			<div class="content">I disagree. What you has to do with you and your personality, it is not possible to delink the two. I did not attack you I just said what you said sounded ungrateful that is all. And if you live abroad you develop certain perspectives that people living in India don't.<br />Â <br />What exactly is wrong with that? Venkat, I am very much hurt and disappointed with your response.Â I have made my subscription to read from the site and am not sure want to write any more. I hope you don't mind reading what is knowledgable here. If not let me know, no problem.<br />Â <br />Thanks<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Thu, 7/24/08, R.venketesh  wrote: <br /><br />From: R.venketesh <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Mahatma Gandhi's assassination denied him Nobel Prize<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Thursday, July 24, 2008, 12:47 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>May I suggest you keep your replies impersonal without reference to <br />my<br />  location or personality.

Gandhi&#39;s impact was not just the freedom<br />  struggle it is world over, the principle of non violence and passive<br />  resistance is too valuable to be throw under the foot as nothing.<br />   <br />    I dont&#39; have any problem discussing Gandhi but we do so with <br />respect -<br />  say I don&#39;t understand this and that of what he did. Fine. But to <br />say we<br />  could have done it without him is downright ungrateful and <br />simplistic.<br />  Simply because you cannot rewrite history to see what it would have <br />been<br />  without any major figure.We could have had software without Bill <br />Gates<br />  &#40;poor poor Steve Jobs&#41;, we could have had someone else invent <br />theory of<br />  relativity if Einstein did not &#40;because Einsteins personal life <br />sucked<br />  you know so toss him aside as well&#41;, we could have had tamil cinema<br />  without Sivaji and MGR &#40;oh well you they dominated and suppressed so<br />  many others so who cares&#41;..where do we stop with this?<br />   <br />    Also dont know which part of the world you live in but to most <br />people<br />  foreigners India is still Gandhi and Gandhi is India.
