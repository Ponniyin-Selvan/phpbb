			<div class="content">With due regards to Dr. Nagamani Ganesan & Dr. Jaybee Ayya - from <br />agathiyar archieves :: <br />=================<br />by Dr. Naa. Ganesan :: ( posted by sps)<br />-----------<br />-A Critical Study of Siddhas and Sufis in Historical Perspective<br />K. V. Ramakrishna Rao, B.Sc., M.A., A.M.I.E., C.Eng.(I)., B.L.,<br />Paper presented during the "World Islamic Tamil Literary Conference"<br />held at Colombo, Sri Lanka in October, 2002<br /><br />Introduction: About Siddhas and Sufis, so far Mohammed Abdur Rahman<br />(1924), M. Shams (1976), A. M. Parimanam (1976), R. Manickavacagam<br />(1983), C. Nayinar Mohammed (1993), P. Kamalakkannan (1993), M. M.<br />Ajmal Khan & P. M. Uvwais (1997), M. S. Bhasir (1999), Mohammed<br />Ibrahim (1999), have conducted their studies directly and<br />indirectly1. Here, the comparative studies made about Hindu-Islam<br />religions also are considered, as they contain references about<br />Siddhas and Sufis2. Originating in the middle-eastern countries,<br />developing in Iran, coming to India and mixing with the factors of<br />local tradition, culture and heritage, Sufism has evolved into a<br />syncretic system in India. The origin of Siddhas has much more<br />antiquity than that of Sufis. Though, Siddhas and their traditions<br />have been spread throughout India, and even in the entire world, as<br />for as the Siddha literature is concerned, the study has to be<br />restricted to Tamizhagam. The literature of Sufis is also available<br />in many other languages, but it is studied within the limits of<br />Tamil literature, and many interesting details are revealed about<br />them. As here, the Siddhas and Sufis are studied in historical<br />perspective, their original texts are taken as source material. The<br />secondary sources are used for interpretations in the relevant<br />contexts.<br /><br />The Siddhas: The scholars, those who have made studies on Siddhas,<br />in their works so far have presented much contradicting details.<br />Instead of critically analyzing their literature ?<br />i. in historical perspective,<br />ii. fixing their dates based on internal evidences with other<br />collateral evidences,<br />iii. preparing a critical text or edition of their poems by<br />pointing out the interpolations etc.,<br />they have simply mentioned that ? the questions like,<br />i. who are Siddhas,<br />ii. what was their period,<br />iii. who exactly sang which songs,<br />iv. how many poems sang etc.,<br />cannot be answered and so on3. Still some others have confused the<br />issue with racial, linguistic and other sectarian bias to mar the<br />fruitful study4. Therefore, with the available evidences, we have to<br />find plausible and possible answers to the questions with open mind.<br /><br />In Sangam literature, the word "Siddha" is not found. In Paripadal,<br />in one place (20:47), the word "Siddham" is used to<br />connote "knowledge". Tirumular in his work Tirumanthiram datable to<br />4th / 5th / 6th century5, uses many words to denote and expound the<br />concept of Siddhars. He uses Siddhu, Cittam, Siddhasan, Siddhar etc.<br />He denotes Siddhas through the expression "Siddhasan" (83, the<br />number denotes the Sutra of Tirumanthiram). Then, specific<br />word "Sivasiddhar" is used, the "Siddhar" is mentioned specifically.<br />Then, it is used in many places (124, 284, 671, 1907 etc). As he<br />mentions, "Sivasiddhar", it is evident that there were other Siddhar<br />also. He answers in the next Sutra (125) about the spirituality<br />level of others ? Siddhar, Nittar, Nimalar, Muttar etc. Siddhar are<br />those who have crossed the 36 tatvas. By telling that there no other<br />place for Siddhu to reach finally other than Siddhu, he implies that<br />the thinking power of man would be restricted to Cosmic mind. As<br />there are no four "ca" as in Sanskrit, the scholars have not given<br />proper meanings to the words ? Siddha, Cittar, Siddhi, Cit, Citta<br />etc. But, Tirumular uses these words properly in the context to<br />convey the meanings exactly as follows: <br /><br />Cit = the best knowledge or thinking (that is different<br />from "acit"), related to mind<br />Citta = related to mind, sub-conscious mind and other layers of mind.<br />Siddhi = the status of attainment of highest powers, a state of<br />perfectness.<br />Cittu = Mind, the state of mind, the state of attaining satisfaction<br />of mind.<br />Siddhu = miracles beyond the perceptions of man, the ability to<br />perform such miracles.<br />Siddham = thinking, finality, the state of mind, the refined<br />thinking process of a perfected mind.<br />Siddhar = the men who are in such status.<br /><br />Sufis: The word "sufi" is derived from the Arabic words<br />differently6, and thus "Sufis" are also interpreted accordingly as<br />follows: <br /><br />1. "safa" = the purity of mind, therefore, the Sufis are those<br />who have purified minds. But, safa -  safa -  safavi to call such<br />persons as "safavi" and not "Sufis" is the counter argument.<br />2. "saf" = the rank or row i.e, the Sufis are the persons, who<br />are in the front row before the God or ranked above all before the<br />God. But, saf becomes safi and not sufi.<br />3. Suffa = a chair to sit i.e, there would be chairs outside<br />mosques, where the persons who sit there are Sufis. But, saffa<br />becomes suffi only and not Sufi.<br />4. Suf = wool and therefore, those who wore wool cloth / dress<br />are called Sufis. Abu Baker al-kalabadhi opines that this<br />interpretation fits to the definition of Sufi to some extent.<br />5. Sufi might have been derived from the Greek "Sophia" is<br />another argument.<br /><br />Anyway, Sufis are better understood by themselves, than the<br />interpretation of the word Sufi. According to the research of Imam<br />Queshayri the word Sufi was in vogue before 822 CE / 2nd hijiri.<br />Syyed Sahabbuddhin Suhravarti notes that though the word "sufi" is<br />not found in Quaran, the word used "muharif" connotes the same<br />meaning, as "such people are near to God" 7. He also points out that<br />usage of such word was not in vogue even after two hundred years<br />after the death of Prophet i.e, up to 9th century8 (632 + 200 =<br />832). Ajmalkhan points out that during 7th century only, such group<br />might have been originated. But, it was not known as "sufi".<br /><br />Sarraj points out that the word "sufi" was used even during the<br />period of Tabin i.e, the successors of the friends of Prophet,<br />refuting the argument that it was used first by the people of<br />Baghdad. To show that the word sufi was current in the pre-Islamic<br />says, he quotes from the "History of Mecca" by Mohammed bin Ishaq<br />bin Yasar, and from others, that there was a period in the history<br />of Mecca when every body had gone away from Mecca, so that nobody<br />was left there to pay homage to the Ka'bah and to go round it.<br />During these days a Sufi used to come from a distant place in order<br />to go round in the prescribed manner. If this story is true, Sarraj<br />points out, then it is evident that the word "sufi" was current in<br />the pre-Islamic days, and was used for men of excellence and<br />virtue9. This view is supported by abi al-Farab ibn al-Jauzi,<br />Zamakhshari and Firruzabadi based on their works. Al-Qushairi<br />explicitly states that the word tasawwuf had been used before 2nd /<br />8th century10. According to him, those among the Sunnites who took<br />extreme care in keeping their contact with God alive and saving<br />themselves from the paths of negligence came to be known by the<br />special name of ahlal-tasawwuf. And this name for these leaders of<br />the pious became well known before 200 / 815. Hujwiri traces back<br />the use of the word sufi even to the Prophet11. Therefore, it is<br />evident that the word sufi was prevalent before 6th / 7th centuries,<br />but tasawwuf only in 8th century. Now, how Sufism and Sufis<br />interacted with Tamizhnadu is discussed.<br /><br />Sufism and Sufis in Tamilnadu: The attack of Malikaffur, on South<br />India and his march up to Rameswaram in 1311, had helped the<br />development of Islam with political patronage in Tamilnadu. The rule<br />of Sultans in Madurai from 1310 to 1358 had an impact on the Tamils<br />culturally. As Muslims had to interact with Hindus, they might have<br />used Sufism as one of such dialogues. Scholars point out12 that<br />penetration of Muslim preachers, poets and Sufis in India had been<br />only after 13th century, therefore, they must have entered only<br />after that period in Tamilnadu. But, scholars have expressed<br />contradicting views about the position of Sufism and Sufis in<br />Tamilnadu: <br /><br />1. R. Muthukumaraswamy notes13 that Sufi literature in Tamil<br />had been prevalent during the last five centuries (1983 - 500 =<br />1483) i.e, from 15th century.<br />2. Ajmalkhan14 records that the principle of Islamic tasawwuf<br />started spreading during 16th and 17th centuries.<br />3. He notes in another place15 that the coming of Muslims in<br />Tamilnadu itself had been the forerunner for establishment of Sufi<br />principles. There are internal evidences to show that the coming of<br />Muslims had been there since Sangam period.<br />4. The credit of usage of Sufi principles first in poems goes<br />to Pir Mohammed Appa16.<br />5. It can be said that the origin of Sufis in Tamilnadu has<br />been there from 17th to 20th centuries17.<br />6. M. S. Purnalingam Pillai18, though he mentions several<br />Mohammedan Tamil poets including Mastan Sahib, but he never records<br />them as Sufi.<br /><br />Therefore, why such contradicting views have been expressed is<br />analyzed: <br /><br />1. Most of the available Islamic Tamil literature belongs to<br />19th century, 3 belong to 18th, 5 to 17th, 2 to 16th, one to 15th<br />and few to 12th centuries.<br />2. Sufi mystic literature starts only with 17th century.<br />3. All poets who composed Islamic literature were not Sufis.<br />4. Similarly, all Tamil Sufis of the material period were not<br />Tamil poets.<br />5. Yacob Siddhar has been considered as "Tamil Siddhar" and his<br />poems have been included in the Tamil Siddha literature. But, it is<br />surprising, that he is not considered as Sufi and his poems not<br />included in the "Sufi mystic literature" 19.<br />6. Had Ramadeva gone to Mecca in 7th century itself, laboured<br />there as Yacob, returned to India and attained samadhi at<br />Azhagarmalai, then, attributing his songs to the period of 15th<br />century is subjected to a critical study. Therefore, if Yacob can be<br />mentioned as "Muslim Siddha", then, Ramadeva be as "Hindu Sufi".<br />7. It is surprising and interesting to note that the composers<br />of the so-called "Tamil Sufi mystic literature" as categorized by<br />the Muslim scholars, had not called themselves as Sufis in their<br />poems, but as "Siddhan". Though, they have used non-Tamil words<br />Peer, mastan, kamil and Tamil words Gnani, yogi, siddhan, arivali,<br />it is surprising to note why they have not used the word Sufi.<br />8. It is totally wrong to assert that Muslims started to come<br />to Tamizhagam since Sangam period, because before Mohammed Nabi,<br />there was no Islam20.<br />9. As the word sufi is not used in Quaran, the Tamil Sufis<br />might have had reservation about the usage of it in their literature.<br />10. Therefore, it is evident that the concepts Sufi, Sufism,<br />Sufi mysticism etc had become popular only in 19th ? 20th centuries<br />and started associating with Islamic mysticism only at the end of<br />20th century.<br /><br />Siddhas and Hindu Religion: Siddhas have been depicted as Tamils and<br />Dravidians, thus, they are against Vedas, Sanskrit, Aryans, Brahmins<br />etc. It is also accused that the elite, educated and high strata of<br />society do not read Tamil Siddha literature, give importance to it<br />or research in related fields. But, if anybody reads the Tamil<br />Siddha literature at least once, he / she can easily understand how<br />these views are false, unfounded and baseless. Just, some examples<br />are given as follows;<br /><br />1. The precept, concept and evolution of Siddhas have been only<br />based on Sanskrit literature and developed into present status.<br />Siddhas have been abundantly described in the Sanskrit literature<br />and depicted in the paintings and sculptures of Maurya and Gupta<br />periods21.<br />2. The Tamil Siddha literature amply shows that Siddhas<br />themselves have names of Itihasa-Puranas and associate their lives<br />with them.<br />3. They have liberally adapted and adopted the subjects of<br />theology, cosmology, cosmogony, chronology etc., from the Sanskrit<br />literature. There are no works in Tamil dealing with such subjects.<br />4. They have used / given the exact terminology, details and<br />symbols in the fields of Yoga, Pranayama and related psychosomatic<br />subjects22.<br />5. They give the same pictures in the usage of mantras, tantras<br />and yantras23.<br />6. As the concepts of One God, Oneness of humanity, Universal<br />brotherhood, absence of idol worship etc., had been there during<br />Vedic period, propagation of such views by Siddhas could not make<br />them against Vedas.<br />7. They themselves point out that Siddhas sculptured many<br />idols, built temples, in fact, the temples were built only at or on<br />their tombs and so on. Then, how such acts could be consistent with<br />the concepts of One God, Monism etc.?<br />8. They gleefully take one poem of Siva Vakkiyar, "Natta kallai<br />deivam enru nalu pushpam sattiye", but, they coolly forget the other<br />poems of the same poet which declares the efficacy of Rama nama,<br />that God is neither Hari or Hara, the place where both sit tohether,<br />the One who is at Tillai and at Tiruvarangam are the One only.<br />9. The concept of world, 96 tatvas of body, 9 gates of body, 24<br />tatvas of atma, 5 butas, 5 gnanendriyas, 5 karmendriyas, 5<br />tanmatras, 5 andakarnas, 5 kosas, 3 gunas, 3 malas, 6 adharas, 7<br />cakras, 10 nadis, 10 vayus, 5 avathais, 3 patrugal, 5 rasamangal, 3<br />mayas, 3 karmas, 5 kanmendriya details, 8 siddhis etc which have<br />been described by the Siddhas have been taken from the Sanskrit<br />mantra-tantra-yantra works. How the cakras drawn in two dimensions<br />evolve into three dimensional figures have been shown.<br />10. In Siddha medicine, however, differences are pointed out,<br />which have to be analyzed clinically to understand the formulations,<br />their derivatives and their effect on human beings.<br /><br />In view of the above, to show that Tamil Siddhas are different from<br />Hindus or they are separate race, specie etc., are totally<br />unhistorical. Some references are given to bring out the point: <br /><br />1. According H. P. Blavatsky23A, Siddhas belong to Fourth root-<br />race datable to 4000 BCE to 4000 BCE.<br />2. According to Shvetashvatara Upanishad (Ch.I, Verses, 3,5,7),<br />the Siddhas are those who possessed from birth of "superhuman"<br />powers, as also of "knowledge and indifference to the world".<br />3. According to occult teachings, however, the Siddhas are<br />Nirmanakayas or the "spirits" ? in thr sense of an individual or<br />conscious spirit ? of great sages from spheres on a higher plane<br />than our own, who voluntarily incarnate in mortal bodies in oirder<br />to help the human race in its upward progress. Hence, their innate<br />knowledge, wisdom and power23B.<br />4. Siddhas are holy saints on the Earth as the celestial yogis<br />in the Heaven, because, their commander is Kartikeya, who supposed<br />to control them.<br />5. Puranas also describe Siddhas grouping them with Devarishis<br />(Vayu Purana, Ch.41:66-73). In other places, they are mentioned with<br />Caranas. They are also grouped with Devas, Demons, Pannagas,<br />Yakshas, powerful Gandharvas, Kinnnaras etc. They are located in<br />Jambu Dwipa on the Jarudhi, Kumudhaprabha, Sitanta mountain peaks<br />and caves.<br /><br />Sufis and Islam: The orthodox Islam opposes Sufism, Sufis and Sufi<br />principles and symbols. It accuses that Sufism accommodates<br />pantheistic ideas and symbolism, compromises with kafirs / idolaters<br />and thus dilutes sacred Islam. It does not recognize the cult that<br />grows around the tombs of Sufis, their worship and other festivals<br />and activities taking place around them24. Wahabi movement opposed<br />it vehemently. In India Shah Waliyullah Dellavi (1703-1762) started<br />a movement25 to eradicate the tomb / Sufi worship, the continuing<br />beliefs and practices among the converted Hindus and other Muslims,<br />completely. Similarly, Islamic scholars decide that Sufis should act<br />within the ambit of Islam and Sufism within the parameters of<br />Quaran, Hadis and Shariat26. Tayka Shuayb Alim, unlike other<br />Islamic scholars, emphasized that Arwi scholars should follow some<br />fundamentals including the following27: <br /><br />1. Uncompromising Faith in Monotheism and in Muhammadur<br />Rasaullah being the Final Prophet of Allah. This is the<br />distinguishing feature of Sufism.<br />2. This earthly life is not eternal but only a passing phase<br />and of momentary instance and the life after death depends on the<br />deeds done in this world.<br />3. The International Brotherhood of islam, which believes in<br />all humanity being one, totally devoid of all parochial and<br />abominable considerations of caste, originated from one father,<br />Prophet Adam.<br />4. Sufism or Tasawwuf represents the spiritual aspect of Islam.<br />So long as a person is in the state of consciousness, he, even as a<br />Sufi (Mystic) or a Wali (Saint), continues to be governed by the<br />Laws of the Shariah.<br /><br />So if these rules are applied, then a Muslim Sufi should be, first<br />an expert in Theology. Then, after becoming a Tamil poet, he should<br />render poems in Tamil. Therefore, it has to be noted as to whether<br />Muslim Tamil poets have rendered Sufi literature as Tamil poets or<br />after becoming Sufi, they rendered such poems. In this context also,<br />the comparison of them with Siddhas fits into the critical study.<br /><br />The Chronological Setting of Tamil Siidhas: With the available<br />internal evidences, the chronology of Tamil Siddhas is divided into<br />following periods28: <br /><br />1. Ancient Period up to Tirumular: Tirumanthiram definitely proves<br />the existence of Siddha system, though such nomenclature was not<br />mentioned in the then extant literature. Its relation to tantras,<br />yoga, alchemy, medicine and other scientific fields are clearly<br />noted. The language, syntax, morphology, etc., clearly show that it<br />belonged to earlier period. As the work is evidently different from<br />Tevaram, Tiruvacakam, Nalayira diya prabandam and other Bhakti form<br />of literature, it can be safely placed before them. The Siddhas, who<br />followed the tradition of Tirumanthiram are covered under the<br />period29.<br /><br />2. Period 7th to 12th Centuries: Till the Muslim domination, the<br />Indian arts and sciences had been at the peak and they were<br />disseminated in other countries. Indian factors of culture,<br />tradition, heritage and civilization could be found in many<br />countries. However, the Indian society was slowly witnessed with the<br />invasion of aliens from the northwest. From the Sindhu invasion of<br />Muslims, Indians started facing with different religious and<br />political sects, all belong to Islam. This impact could be felt in<br />Tamizhagam also. If the sojourn of Ramadeva and Yacob is considered<br />historical, then, the link between Middle East and South India is<br />established. The Saiva Siddhanta philosophy started developed (13th-<br />14th centuries) attracting others. However, certain groups started<br />indulging in the preparation of elixir, conversion of baser elements<br />into gold and other activities30. The movement of Chinese groups<br />increased with trade and other contacts. In those days, mercury had<br />to come from China.<br /><br />3. Medieval period up to 13th century: This period coincided with<br />the alchemy activities and Chinese contacts and interactions.<br />Indians sojourned from South India to Tibet, China and South East<br />Asian countries through Assam31. The maritime activities of Cola<br />kings in the South East Asian countries also gave a fillip to the<br />activities of Siddhas and their movements. The Siddha medicinal<br />system was distinguished, codified and institutionalized. The Saiva<br />Siddhanta started moulding the philosophy and theology of Saivism in<br />Tamilnadu. Agama sastras were interpreted according to Siddhanta and<br />temples built and rebuilt reviving tradition. Siddhas, who based<br />their interpretation on Vedas wrote in Sanskrit. The Saiva<br />Siddhantists also wrote in Sanskrit and Tamil. But, the Siddhas in<br />question had chosen only Tamil.<br /><br />4. Modern period up to 20th Century: Most of the Siddha literature<br />was produced only during this period. Christianity and Islam created<br />a great impact on Hindu religion. In fact, the missionaries of both<br />religions worked maximum to exert their pressure on Hindus and<br />social institutions. They started learning Tamil. They also employed<br />Tamil poets32 to write their literature in Tamil. When, some of them<br />were converted, they were encouraged to produce more literature in<br />the respective converted religions33. The literature produced by the<br />respective groups throw much light on the material period.<br />Initially, they followed the Tamil literary tradition totally, and<br />then started introducing changes with the usage of Arabic, Urudu and<br />other languages. Interaction with Islam and Christianity, Hindu<br />religious leaders voluntarily and otherwise started reforming their<br />traditional practices. Siddhas and Siddha like literature had also<br />increased. As explained above, the Siddhars of this period have been<br />creation of these factors.<br /><br />The Chronology of Tamil Sufis: As already explained, Sufis must have<br />existed even before the advent of Islam. However, the Sufis after<br />Islam were divided into two groups: <br /><br />1. The Sufis who spread the message composing poems within the<br />ambit of Quaran, Hadis and Shariat and it is referred to as Tasawwuf.<br />2. The Sufis who composed poems with the influence of pre-<br />Islamic and non-Islamic factors of culture, tradition, and heritage<br />either because they lived in such areas or converted to Islam from<br />those areas.<br />Thus, even among the Tamils, this type of Sufis could be found.<br />Therefore, taking all such factors, the chronology of Tamil Sufis is<br />divided as follows: <br /><br />1. The period up to Yacob (7th / 12th / 15th / 17th century): <br />Had Yacob actually gone to Mecca and met Nabi / Nabimar, then that<br />period must have been 7th century, as Prophet Mohammed (PBCH) period<br />is 570-633 CE. After him, there was no Nabi / Prophet, therefore, he<br />could not have met any other Nabi after that period. Therefore, it<br />has to be checked in the Arabic literature about the authenticity of<br />the visit of Ramadeva / Yacob. The other dates 12th / 12th / 17th<br />centuries, as suggested by scholars do not suit the descriptive<br />details as given in the Siddha literature. There are other<br />references to the effect that Bogar also visited Jerusalem and Mecca<br />driving his smoking vehicle and met Nabimar , when they asked about<br />him, he replied that he had come there to see Nabi. Suddenly, he had<br />the words / voice of Prophet (?) and converted himself<br />into "Malucka" (=Muslim) to become a disciple of Nabi / Nabimar<br />(Bogar.3.222 and 3.227). Therefore, again, these details are to be<br />cross-checked with the Persian, Arabic and other sources. As Guru<br />Nanak (1469-1539) had visited Mecca34, the sojourn of Siddhas to<br />Mecca may not be impossible.<br />2. Up to the Period of Pir Mohammed Appa (1576-1664) 35: <br />Definitely, for the first time, the Sufi doctrine has been dealt<br />with in poems by Pir Mohammed Appa. His works ? Gnanappugazhcci,<br />Gnanppal, Gnanapputtu, Gnanamanimalai have been composed within the<br />ambit of Islam and also Sufi poems.<br />3. From Gunangudi Masta (1792-1838) to 20th century: The Sufi /<br />Mystic poems of Gunangudi Mastan has created an impact on the minds<br />of mystic quest of every religious pursuit without any<br />differentiation. In fact, there have been more Hindu disciples to<br />him than Muslims and so also followers even after his departure. His<br />mystic symbols have been widely appreciated, though orthodox Islam<br />opposed.<br />4. Modern period ? After 20th Century: After the establishment<br />of definite idea of Tamil Sufi literature, research studies started<br />with the reprinting of Tamil Sufi literature.<br /><br />Siidhas - non-Siddhas and Sufis ? non-Sufis: Siddhas have clearly<br />recorded the details in their literature like ? Who are Siddhas, how<br />they should be, and so on. However, they have not mentioned non-<br />Siddhas or the persons, who were not Siddhas with any specific name.<br />Though they have criticized that the secret language of the Siddhas<br />would be understandable only to learned persons and not to<br />other "simpletons", "sinners", "half-baked scholars" etc36, they<br />have not used any common word or expression to denigrate them. In<br />fact, there are exclusive claims that "these poems have been<br />composed only for Siddhas". Such specific exclusive claims are<br />mostly found in the alchemy related works. As alchemy and other<br />elixir making techniques were guarded carefully, such expressions<br />have been used, as otherwise, if such techniques fell into the hands<br />of greedy and wicked, they would be misused. They have also attacked<br />the social stratification based on work etc. But, not only in<br />ordinary Islamic Tamil literature, even in Mystic / Sufi literature,<br />the non-Sufis are specifically mentioned or referred to<br />as "kafir", "kufru" and other expressions with these adjectives37.<br />In Islamic context, such expressions explicitly denote to non-<br />Muslims with the implication of non-believers. Therefore, it is<br />intriguing for Sufis to choose such terminology to use in their<br />mystic literature. It is hoped that they would not have used them in<br />such a narroe sense, as they have also worked for the unity of<br />humanity. The explanation given by Mohammed Ibrahim alias<br />Karunaiananda Bhupathi in this context is relevant to be noted.<br /><br />Are the Siddhas' Mysticism and Indian Mysticism one? The poems of<br />Siddhas, though appear to have been dominated with Saivite<br />philosophy, have attempted to connect other branches of Hindu<br />religion. There are specific poems, which compare Vaishnavite and<br />Saivite branches of Hindu religion. Sivavakkiyar clearly mentions at<br />many places that, "There is neither Hari nor Hara", "Whether Black<br />or Red, both are equal", That one who has Cakra and another both<br />live together", "He is the Lord of Tillai and also that of<br />Tiruvarangam", "Narayana and Namasivaya are one and the same" and so<br />on. The Siddhass have rendered the poems on the subjects of Yoga and<br />Pranayamam and explain their subtle methods figuratively keeping<br />Sakti in their minds. They have incorporated high philosophical<br />concepts like - God, the manifestations of God, God's creation, the<br />wonders of geology and cosmology, time, the birth and death of man,<br />and also the useful medicinal system, cheap medicine, protective<br />medicine, the health and hygiene of man, the prolongation of life in<br />their poems in simple language. As they have interpreted and<br />explained with the methods of mantra-tantra-yantra, they have been<br />unison with the Indian mystical thought. Indian mysticism revolves<br />around the concepts like ? how to know God, how to reach God, what<br />is the relation between God and man, why man is born and died, what<br />is the purpose of his life on the earth. As the method has been<br />always to go from "known" to "unknown", "comprehensible"<br />to "incomprehensible", "manifested" to "unmanifested", it is found<br />both in science and mysticism in search of truth. As Indian<br />tradition embraces and unifies the concepts of science and<br />mysticism, such trend is noted in the poems of Siddhas.<br /><br />Are Sufi Mysticism and Islamic Mysticism One? The question is<br />redundant in the true mystical way of quest. However, as the<br />difference is pointed out by the Islamic scholars, it is discussed<br />here. M. Hamidudin, points out that the Sufi researchers uses two<br />words al-tasawwuf and sufi to denote mysticism in the Islamic<br />context38. M. M. Sharif divides Islamic Mystics into three groups<br />and lists as follows39: <br /><br />1. Sufis: The Sufis are divided into two categories ? before al-<br />Hajjaj and after al-Hajjaj, though, the names of the Sufis before al-<br />Hajjaj are Hasan of Basrah, Abu Hashim of Kufah, Ibrahim bin Adham,<br />Shaqiq of Bakh, Harith Muhasibi, Rabi'ah al-Adawiyyah of Basra, Dhu<br />al-Nun Misri, Bayazid Bistami, Junaid of Baghdad. The names<br />mentioned after him are abd al-Khadhir Jilani, Sihab al-din<br />Suhrawardi, ibn-Arabi.<br />2. Mystic saints / Philosophers: Al-Khindi, Muhammed ibn<br />Zakariya al-Raji, a?Farabi, Miskawaih, Ibn Sina, Ibn Bajjah, Ibn<br />Tufail, Ibn Rushd, Nasir al-Din Tusi.<br />3. Middle-Roaders: Al-Ghazali, Fakir al-Din Razi.<br /><br />The works and modern books specifically mention tasawwuf or Sufism<br />one side and tasawwuf that is within the ambit of Islam at another<br />side.<br /><br />As Sufism developed around Sufis, their tombs, the rituals and<br />festivals connected with their tombs, their speeches, acts, and<br />poems also developed and published by the followers. Because of the<br />influence of non-Islamic factors, many times, they are considered as<br />un-Islamic. Persian and Indian Sufism has definitely influenced by<br />and incorporated local factors and symbols of tradition, culture and<br />heritage. Similarly, the South Indian and particularly, the Tamil<br />Sufism has such factors. Of late, orthodoxy has tried to bring such<br />groups within the ambit of Islam through Islamization. Similar<br />subjects handled by the Sufis are re-interpreted under Islamic<br />theology, Islamic Cosmology, Islamic philosophy, Islamic Mysticism,<br />Islamic Metaphysics, Islamic Aesthetics and so on.<br /><br />Muslim Philosophers and Sufis have also been differentiated<br />accordingly. A passage is quoted for this purpose40: <br /><br />"The true philosophes are those who adhere to the philosophic<br />teaching of the Greeks. But there are those who are not content with<br />this mode of inquiry and have gone far beyond it. These are the<br />Sufis whose religious leaders (murshid) invent various formulas<br />(dhikr) to be repeated by their followers. Besides these mysterious<br />formulas the novices are instructed in the performance of ascetic<br />practices in order that by these two means their hearts may<br />beenlightened by the visions of the unseen world, of prophets, etc.<br />They believe in the existence of numerous worlds, the world of<br />humanity (alam-I-nasut), the invisible world (alam-I-malakut), which<br />is the abode of angels, the higest heaven (alam-I-jabarut), the<br />world of divinity (alam-I-lahut) and the world ofessence (alam-I-<br />dhat). There are according to them many degrees of the knowledge of<br />God and approach to Him; the final stage being that of reality<br />(haqiqat), in which individuality is lost (fani) and the soul<br />becomes absorbed (wasil, muttahid, mustaghraq) in the deity. The<br />main difference between the philosophers and the Sufis in their<br />search for truth is this, that the former confine themselves to<br />reason and argument and have nothing to do with the ascetic<br />practices of the mystics. The beliefs and tenets of both are the<br />same. The philosophers, for example, prove the existence of the<br />above-mentioned worlds by reasoning (istidlal): the Sufis say that<br />they actually behold them (mushahidah) and speak disrespectfullyof<br />mere reasoning as compared with sight. Thus, the author<br />of "Mathnavi", himself a Sufi says, "The foot of the reasoners<br />(i.e, the philosophers) will be wooden; the wooden foot will be<br />exceedingly feeble". The following story is told of the Sufi, Abu<br />said-Abul-khaor and the philosopher Abu Ali-Sina.<br />The Sufi remarked, "I am traversing the worlds", and he began to<br />describe them.<br />The philosopher rejoined, " I too was traversing the".<br />To which the Sufi replied, "Quite right; you were doing so. But, I<br />was going along quickly, while you were hobbling along behind me<br />with a stick'<br />The Sufis practically consider themselves as the religious guides of<br />the age and successors of the prophets. All the philosophers of the<br />present day follow the teaching of Mulla Sadra, whose system, an<br />eclectic one, called the "exalted philosophy (bikmat-I-mutaliya)",<br />and expounded in a work named "Asfar", aims at reconciling Greek<br />philosophy, Sufism, the Quaran and the Traditions".<br /><br />If the works of Pir Mohammed Appa, Gunangudi Mastan and others are<br />seen in this perspective of higher criticism, then, no difference<br />could be found. In whatever way, the great people are divided and<br />differentiated as mystics, philosophers, Sufis and so on, the nature<br />of truth seeker's aim is one only. The great sages and mystics<br />appear to differ at higher level, some times, but it is not so. That<br />is why at higher level, both Sidhas and Sufis could be considered or<br />compared together and any religious fetters do not bind them. Hence<br />the possibility of their meetings are considered critically.<br /><br />Have Siddhas and Sufis Ever Met together? From the poems of Siddhas,<br />about the sojourn oif Ramadeva and Bogar has already been mentioned.<br />Ramadeva went to Mecca, converted himself into Yacob and then<br />returned back to India as Ramadeva. Though, his date is variously<br />mentioned as 7th / 12th / 15th / 17th centuries, when he sojouned<br />there, definitely, he would have met Sufis. The historical documents<br />have well recorded about the movement of people from middle east to<br />India and vice versa41. Historians have established well about the<br />connections between Persia and India since time immemorial42. The<br />influence on the poems of Jalaluddhin Rumi, Hafiz, Omar Khayyam has<br />been pointed out by many scholars43. Omar Khayyam belonged to<br />Neshabour / Nishapur, Iran. Ibn Batuta records about the meeting of<br />Shaik Mohammed Majdhubi at the city of Pathan. Moreover, the<br />mentioned details44 are to be noted here,<br /><br />"I met Shaik Mohammed Majdhubi, who has come from Nishapuri at the<br />city (of Pathan). He belongs to the group of Fakirs, who always<br />would be in the status of ecstasy. His hair was hanging down upto<br />his shoulders. A lion was with him. As it is a pert, it eats with<br />them. Thirty Darveshs are with him. One among the m was rearing a<br />deer. Both deer and lion lived together".<br /><br />As the Sultan of the material period might be Giasuddhin Damakhani<br />(1341-1344), the city "Pathan" might be "Kayalpattinam", Shaik<br />Mohammed Majdhubi could be a Sufi. Indians were there in the Middle<br />east, even before the advent of Islam there. During the Abbasid<br />period many Indian Scholars and Pundits were invited for the<br />translation of Indian works into Arabic and further study.<br />Therefore, the Sufis in Tamizhagam during the period would have met<br />Siddhas and such possibilities had been many.<br /><br />Particularly, during 18th ? 19th ? 20th centuries, as such sages,<br />saints and others moved from place to place meeting different people<br />of Tamizhagam, they have met with each other. The possibilities of<br />other meeting with each other are also analyzed: <br /><br />1. The mystic poems of Gunangudi Mastan (1792-1838) have many<br />Yoga, Pranayama, Mantra, Yantra, Tantra methods and explanations.<br />Hindus have accepted him as guru and followed his methods widely.<br />Therefore, Siddha-Sufi meetings in his context are explicit and must<br />have taken place.<br />2. The meeting of Pir Mohammed Appa with Muthuswamy Thampiran.<br />3. There were two Muslim disciples among Sadasiva Brimendrar<br />(17th ? 18th Cent.). When they died, two toms were erected and they<br />are still known as "Irattai Mastan" (Two Mastans) in Tanjore45.<br />4. During the sojourn of Sadasiva Brimendrar, a Muslim cut off<br />of his hand. But, he proceeded as if nothing happened. When the<br />Muslim showed his hand, he simply put it on the cut off portion and<br />it struck back to its portion. Realizing the spiritual power of the<br />Saint, he sought apology. But the saint went away as if nothing<br />happened.<br />5. The stories of Sadasiva Brimendrar and Gunangudi Mastan<br />resemble much46. As both belonged to the same periuod, they might<br />have met each other.<br />6. Kumara Gurubarar (1686-1779), Tayumanavar (1608-1662 / 1705-<br />1742), Siva Prakasar (1680-1746) have specifically refuted<br />Christianity. Gunangudi Mastan too attacked Christianity<br />vigoruously. Therefore, in this aspect, whether they or their<br />disciples knew each other or worked together is a point of debate<br />and further research considering the contemproneity and other<br />factors.<br />7. The Tamil work, "Kaivalya Navanitham" has great impact on<br />all Saints, philosophers and others during the material period. It<br />has refuted all other religious tenets philosophically, logically<br />and met-physically. As Muslim scholars have discussed about "Islamic<br />Advaita" to counter "Advaita" of Hindu religion, definitely, the<br />involved Hindu and Muslim scholars might have met. Mohammed Abdur<br />Rahman in his book, "Muslim Advaita Mozhi" has discussed about such<br />possibilities47.<br />8. Tayumanavar and Gunangudi Mastan sojourned parts of Tiruchy ?<br />Cadhuragiri, Purumalai, Nagamalai, Yanaimalai etc. As Tayumanavar<br />met Siddhas of those areas, Gunangudi Mastan could have also met.<br />9. Melappalayam Shaikbu Ali Shahmadar Alim had read works like<br />Kaivalya Navanitham, Vicara Sagaram, Gnana Vasittam,<br />Ozhivilozhukkam, Vedapuranam, Pirappa Padalgal, Gunangudi Mastan<br />Padalgal, Manimuttumalai in his younger days. Therefore, he might<br />have met Siddhas, because of his interest in the related subjects,<br />as otherwise, he could not have understood the nuances of the<br />subjects in question.<br />10. There are references that a Muslim continuously after<br />Ramalinga Adigal to get the Rasavada technique from him. There is a<br />claim that Ramalinga was a third disciple of Arabic Sufi Thanikai<br />Manippiran.<br />11. Tamil Muslim mystics have composed their poems connecting<br />the Siddha and Sufi mystical aspects. Takkalai Gnani Pirappa and<br />Gunangudi Mastan have used the mystic ideas and expressions of<br />Pattinattar and Tayumanavar and thus acting as bridge between Siddha<br />Mysticism and Islamic Mysticism48.<br />12. There are many references that Karaikkal Mastan Sahib<br />Valiyullah49 had met many Siddhas. Though such references had been<br />Islamic biased, they clearly prove that the Siddha-Sufi encounters<br />had taken place.<br />13. Sufi Mystics have had Hindu friends, disciples and<br />followers. They have also obtained "diksha" ? initiation from them.<br />They are in the pursuit of Siddhas.<br />14. About Muslim mystic poets, many Hindu poets have<br />composed "Sattukkavi" i.e, poems of introductory nature. Therefore,<br />they must have known well aware of the poems about which they<br />describe.<br /><br />There are many Siddha-Sufi dialogues, meetings and encounters. In<br />historical perspectives, if they are facts, they should be cross-<br />checked from each other source and can be used for further search.<br />As the source materials, documents and other references are of<br />recent origin, their authenticity could be verified easily to find<br />out the truth. As there are references about imposters, frauds and<br />cheats among the Siddha-Sufi literature, they are also to be<br />discussed.<br /><br />Fake Siddhas / Sufis / Gnaniyar / Pirs / Yogis etc: As for as<br />Masqueraded Siddhas are concerned, they were there even during the<br />Tirumular period and hence, he has condemned them like anything. He<br />urged that it is the duty of the ruler to contain such imposters.<br />Those who do not have and follow the Vedic principles, there is no<br />meaning for them to masquerade with saffron dress and other<br />paraphernalia. It is better to cut off their gudimi (the tout) and<br />punul (sacred thread). The ruler has to investigate into such<br />activities. He accursed the destroyers of temples and breakers of<br />idols in clear terms. A consecrated Linga should not be removed from<br />its place for any reason. Not even a brick should fall from the<br />compound of any temple. If anything happens like that, he warns that<br />sufferings would increase, rains stop, the (good) rule disappear and<br />so on50. Therefore, it is evident that the moment, Siddhas deviate<br />from the traditional path / Tirumular tradition, and switched over<br />to the practices of rasavada, the fake Siddhas started increasing.<br />Fake Siddha works also increased accordingly. Moreover, the fake<br />Siddhas started destroying the works of others. The genuine Siddhas<br />also started destroying their own works fearing that their works<br />should fall into the hands of quacks and imposters, so that the time<br />tested methods are misused by them. They have recorded the tearing<br />down the palm leave manuscripts of many works in their poems<br />themselves. That is why the researchers now declare that the<br />original works of Siddhas have already disappeared. The available<br />Siddha works have been composed by some poets and started circulated<br />in their names and they are forged only51. Purnalingam Pillai has<br />gone to the extent of telling that Siddhas have done a great<br />injustice to the Tamil literature because, though their works appear<br />as poems, they contain very ordinary words and expressions just like<br />prose, language, syntax, colloquial vocabulary etc.<br /><br />Similarly, the Muslim mystics have criticized and condemned the fake<br />mystics / saints as poli gnaniyar. Particularly, Pir Mohammed Appa<br />and Maccaregai Sittan used strong language to condemn them. They are<br />kafirs, as the misinterpret scriptures, they recite scriptures like<br />dogs for money, eulogize falling at the feet of Pirs ? thus, Pir<br />Mohammed Appa condemns. Maccaregai Sittan condemns them as the<br />masqueraded Saitans, who came as Shaik, Syed, Fakir, Mastan, Kamil,<br />Ganani, Yogi etc. With facade of Sufis, they misled the common<br />people and exploit them with their spurious messages. Here, the<br />words as Shaik, Syed, Fakir, Mastan, Kamil, etc specifically denote<br />Muslims and Ganani, Yogi etc Muslim and non-Muslims. Therefore, the<br />following facts are evident: <br /><br />1. The so called fake Shaiks, Syeds, Fakirs, Mastans, Kamils,<br />Gananis, Yogis etc would have been opposed as they had un-Islamic<br />opinion and practiced connected methods with objectionable<br />paraphernalia.<br />2. The Shaiks, Syeds, Fakirs, Mastans, Kamils, Gananis, Yogis<br />etc would have gone to the extent of appearing as Hindu counterparts<br />or the difference would have been disappeared and thus, the orthodix<br />Sufis would have warned in their poems.<br />3. Non-Muslims might have been attracted towards Sufism and<br />adapted and adopted such dress, practice etc. As the orthodox<br />Muslims did not want their mixing with Muslims, they would have<br />warned.<br /><br />Why this type of fake Siddha-Sufi groups should have increased<br />during the 18th ? 20th centuries period is to be studied critically.<br />It is evident that these groups indulged in non-spiritual<br />activities, that is why Sivavakkiyar has categorically refuted the<br />communalist Siddhas and Sufis: <br /><br />"Is there your God and our God thus God existing<br />separately,<br />Can God exist here and there as two Gods for two<br />believers,<br />Do not you know that the omnipresent God is one.<br />Those who differentiate God would die with disease<br />in their mouths".<br /><br />How these groups could be divided is discussed now: <br /><br />1. Fake Saints / imposters existing in their own Religion: As<br />there was respect in the society, the fakes would have imitated<br />through name, dress, behaviour and other external factors, though<br />they were not match with the genuine ones in intellectual and<br />spiritual capacities.<br />2. Fake Saints / imposters existed to cheat / undermine the<br />Other Religion: As the other religionists wanted to know the<br />theology, philosophy, liturgy, etc, they tried to don the robes so<br />that they could dupe ordinary people with their expertise.<br />Particularly, for conversion activities, such methodology was<br />adapted and adopted.<br />3. Masquerade as the Religion of the Majority: To get the<br />confidence of Gurus, head of mutts, Siddhas and others, one has to<br />don the robes and mannerism of the religion of the majority and<br />thus, they followed the suit.<br />4. Masquerade to Grab the Secrets of other Religion: Indian<br />religion was supposed to possess many secrets like elixir,<br />transmutation of metals, flying, levitation, transmigration and so<br />on. Therefore, the other religionists were very much interested in<br />learning such tricks and other magic. Thus, they donned the robes of<br />Siddhas. Most of them were interested in rasavada techniques and<br />those who could not learn successfully roamed to cheat the public.<br />5. Masquerade for Political Purposes: Many worked as spies for<br />the rulers sending information to them as they could freely move in<br />different parts of the country and move with all people without<br />restriction.<br /><br />These tendencies were noted in both the categories of Siddhas and<br />Sufis during the material period as has been recorded and reflected<br />through the respective literature as pointed out above. As fake<br />saints / imposters increased, their literature also increased.<br />Therefore, they are studies critically.<br /><br />Fake / Forged Siddha-Sufi Literature: Except the compilation of<br />Siddha literature available as "Siddhar padalgal", "Periya<br />Gnanakkovai", among the works of name and style, Vaidhyam ? 1000,<br />Karukkidai Vaidhyam ? 600, Bogar Vaidhyam ? 1000, Karpam ? 360,<br />Gnanasaramsam ? 100 etc., attributed to Tirumular, Agasthiyar etc.,<br />most of them are forged only. However, the existence of genuine<br />Siddha literature on medicine is not questioned or doubted and the<br />discussion is restricted here only to the forged works. This fact<br />can be easily understood with the internal evidences. For example in<br />Pulippani Vaidhyam, it has been mentioned under the<br />Chapter "Nalyugangalin varalaru" (The History of Four Yugas) that<br />Boganathar lived during Dwarapayuga (i.e, 5105 YBP = Years Before<br />Present), Pulippani 205 years after the starting of Kaliyuga (i.e,<br />3102 ? 205 = 2897 BCE = Before Common Era) or 4899 YBP52. Similarly,<br />the details found in the works attributed to Agasthiyar contain<br />contradictory and non-verifiable data about the Yugas. Moreover,<br />such details are not supported by any historical evidences.<br />Therefore, the writers / composers of such works have purposely used<br />the half-baked details of Yugas, the names and incidences of<br />Itihasas and Puranas in the most assertive and authorittative tone<br />and tenor to appear as if the works are authentic just to<br />exhilarate, excite and inspire the readers. To take another example<br />of a poem attributed to Tiruvalluvar, which runs as follows53: <br /><br />"Calling the God Allah, folding their arms, worship<br />saying -<br />"Illallah" and bending their bodies, and heads<br />touching the ground.<br />Tell the message of God with the Cross, the Sutas,<br />Conquer through Spiritual propaganda, the<br />Christians".<br /><br />The conveyed meaning is self explanatory, but, during the period of<br />Tiruvalluvar, there was no Christianity or Islam on the earth.<br />Therefore, to what extent the forger could go could be known and<br />understood by these forged, counterfeit and spurious works. In fact,<br />it is a big literary and historical fraud to circulate such poems in<br />the name of Tiruvalluvar or Tirumular.<br /><br />Among the Rasavada literature also, the forged literature has been<br />plenty. There are works with names - "The Book of the King", "The<br />Book of Mildness", "The Book of Weight", "The Book of Mercury", "The<br />Book of the 70", "The Book of the 1200" and so on attributed to<br />Jabir ibn Hayyan / Jabar, Jibir / Geber / Jiyaber. These books<br />contain the details about the preparation of elixir, conversion of<br />Iron / Copper into Silver / Gold and so on. Till 1678, these were<br />included in the Medical encyclopedias, reference books etc<br />attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. The French chemist Marcellin<br />Berthelot (1826-1907), E. J. Holmyard, and Paul Kraus conclusively<br />proved that these works were only Latin Geberian forgeries54. They<br />were written after about 900 CE by the Arab religious sect<br />called "Islamia" took the name of Jabir and wrote these works fro<br />the "unknown" sources! The existing works belong to 13th ? 14th<br />centuries. But, the scholars surprisingly, do not mention as to who<br />actually wrote these works, which are the original source works, why<br />they were written, when copied or adapted and adopted from "the<br />originals" or "unknown sources", why such sources were not<br />acknowledged, why the names of the original writers not mentioned.<br /><br />It is evident that the western and Arab / Muslim writers perhaps did<br />not know the Siddhas and their works and therefore they could not<br />relate the connection between them with the works. Those who read<br />the existing works of Siddhas and the researchers on Siddhas could<br />easily find out the similarity between the names of Siddhas and<br />these forged works. Not only the names, even the poems, the methods<br />mentioned to compose medicinal preparations, herbs / minerals used<br />etc are very similar. Therefore, taking the accounts of sojourn of<br />Siddhas to the Middle-eastern countries, it can easily be concluded<br />that these works belong to Siddhas only. Such happenings could have<br />taken place in historical settings in historical perspective as<br />follows: <br /><br />1. As Indian works of Medicine, Astronomy, Astrology,<br />Mathematics, etc., were translated into Arabic during the Abbasid<br />period even by bringing the Indian Pundits / scholars from India,<br />some Arabs must have written these works from the works of Siddhas.<br />2. Adapting and adopting from the works of Siddhas, they must<br />have been attributed to an Arabic scholar. Jabir ibn Hayyan is<br />considered as "the first Sufi alchemist". Therefore, his nae must<br />have been used by them for respect and popularity.<br />3. The Siddhas who lived in the middle-east and got converted<br />into Islam, might have written such works.<br />4. As the episodes of conversion of Ramadeva and Bogar into<br />Islam is mentioned, whether they were written by them is subjected<br />to further critical study.<br /><br />The scholars have mentioned the following details to that effect: <br /><br />1. They say that the words al-kaya denote Alkalis / salts,<br />segimen vitri to Carbonate of Soda, tutia to Copper Sulphate, al<br />kuhl to finely ground grey Antomony ore etc.<br />2. "al-iksir" is nothing but Kayakalpam. The western scholars<br />like George Lockmann forcefully try to derive the word from the<br />Greek "gerion", xerio = desiccative and Arabic "imam" = the leader,<br />they could not give proper and associated concepts and meanings.<br />But, in Indian connotation, it is well known that "Kayakalpam" is<br />used for rejuvenation of the body or keeping the body young without<br />aging.<br />3. Moreover, the procedure prescribed, course explained and<br />methodology used do not suit or match with their tradition, culture,<br />heritage and civilization and such factors point to India.<br /><br />Therefore, it is evident that either they would not have known the<br />Siddhas and their works or knowingly, they did not mentioned them<br />with bias. The noting of Ajmalkhan55 can be quoted here ?<br />"The knowledge of chemistry must have gone from India to western<br />countries. Siddhas Bogar and Ramadeva alias Yacob spread their works<br />wherever they went. They visited Arabia, Turkey, China and other<br />countries and had spread the Siddha medicinal practices".<br /><br />Thus, these details constitute the first Siddha-Sufi dialogue taken<br />place in the field of medicine.<br /><br />The Siddha-Sufi Dialogue in Cosmology etc: The differences between<br />the Siddhas and Sufis in the concepts of Cosmology and related<br />subjects are very minimal. They are summarised as follows: The<br />origin of Universe, the regulatory motion of planets and other<br />bodies in the sky, time calculation etc., are governed by natural<br />laws. The creation of objects, their composition, size, shape, or<br />the physical and chemical properties are in consonance with natural<br />laws. When men at different parts of world try to perceive, conceive<br />and visualize to project in objective forms they resemble. The<br />subjective and objective symbolisms have played important role in<br />all religions through the interpretation of theology, theogony,<br />philosophy, ethics, metaphysics and so on. Siddhas have represewnted<br />many concepts in the forms of dot, line, angle, triangle, rectangle,<br />pentagon in two dimensions and solid figures ? sphere, cube,<br />rhombohedron, tetrahedron etc., in three dimensions, and they are<br />otherwise known as cakras / mandalas, and vigrahas / idols. Sufis<br />reflected such ideas through calligraphy and then in mandalas<br />themselves56. Though, initially, the places of worship did not have<br />any symbolism like signs, marks, colours, designs etc., later the<br />mosques started to incorporate all such symbolism. As the shapes<br />change, constructional methods also change as they are related to<br />theology and cosmology.<br /><br />M. Ajmal points out that the mandala figures exhibit the completion<br />of spirituality. Kitab-al-thriyak contains the figures of such<br />mandalas57. Lale Bakthtiar58 has also published some mandala<br />figures. The concept of Sahadhak explains how it is used in the<br />construction technology. Here, the mandala represents ground plan.<br />In three-dimensional representation, a cone is on a cubical vault.<br />The squaring a circle and circling a square method is used in such<br />building technology. The open space in between is the place of<br />Sufi, where he takes birth, dies and again takes spiritual rebirth.<br />These mandalas / cakras are related to geometry and mathematics and<br />thus numbers. Thus, they have significant theological and<br />cosmological meanings. It is well known that the present day<br />numerical system, numbers and their representation started in India<br />and spread to other countries. Some scholars59, surprisingly remark<br />casually that it is not known as to how Indian numerals were<br />introduced in Muslim countries. In fact, the Arabs themselves called<br />the numbers "Hindsa" meaning that the digits / numbers came from<br />India, "Sind-Hind", the philosophy came from India and so on.<br />Therefore, the similarity found between Siddhas and Sufis is quite<br />natural.<br /><br />The Siddha-Sufi Dialogue in Medicine: The Siddhas, who adhered to<br />the traditions of Tirumular, not only excelled in the medicinal<br />methods, but also treated common people with the preparations of<br />medicines obtained with natural sources ? like herbs, barks and<br />minerals. Such medicinal preparations and formulations had been<br />consistent with nature and could be made easily. This medicinal<br />system only is known as "Siddha medicine". But, later, calling<br />themselves as Siddhas, some indulged in the preparations of elixir<br />and other related mixtures with the combination of Mercury and<br />Sulfur. They also attempted to convert base metals into silver and<br />gold. As mercuric preparations could convert baser metals into gold,<br />they asserted that with the different mixtures of mercuric<br />formulations, the human life could be extended. Sufis also fostered<br />such methods and tried to learn more from the Siddhas. Actually, the<br />longevity of human life is related to breadth and by controlling<br />breadth only, the life can be extended and by consuming any<br />medicine. That is why Sufis too used such bread control related<br />symbolism in their songs. The attempts of Ramadeva, who tried to<br />study about the living organisms under the desert sands of Arabia<br />and determine as to how they could live under such extreme<br />temperatures. He suggested that if man could also adapt and adopt<br />himself with nature, he could also live like such plants without any<br />difficulties. He taught such methods to his disciples there. The<br />subject of breadth control has been dealt with by Pir Mohammed Appa,<br />Gunangudi Mastan and Maccaregai Sittan.<br /><br />The Siddha-Sufi Dialogue in Numbers, Astrology, Astronomy etc: The<br />relation of numbers eith other subjects has already been mentioned<br />earlier. Similarly, the importance of numbers could be noted in<br />astrology and astronomy. The tradition of astronomy of Omar Khayyam,<br />Jamshid Al Kashi, Ulkag Baig and others have been bridging the<br />civilizations of India and the middle-east. The astrological<br />connections are also very significant. Numbers are profusely used<br />when astrological predictions are made on human life with reference<br />to planetary motions and their influence. When rasi mandala / Zodiac<br />and Nakshatras / stars are also related, the medicinal aspects are<br />also linked with human life. The details that - how different acts<br />are to done at different appropriate time, whether the child to be<br />born is male or female, when the building of house should be<br />started, what are the results of lizard falling on human beings,<br />good and bird omens due to animals and birds, etc., are found in<br />such books. The books used by Muslims show clearly that they are<br />also believers of such practices and in fact have been using in<br />their day to day lives60. These details are found in the books<br />like "Lanurul Mukhminin". Moreover, numbers forming different magic<br />squares and predictions based on such squares, which are common both<br />in Siddha and Sufi literature61. Though the orthodox Islam has<br />opposed these practices and condemned them as un-Islamic and even<br />anti-Islamic, sections of Muslims continued to use them. As such<br />books are printed and reprinted continuously in many editions, it is<br />evident that such books have been in good demand among the Muslims.<br /><br />Some scholars might argue that such practices are only Islamic and<br />not Siddha influenced. But, then how such same practices have been<br />prevalent among the two religionists has to be studied critically -<br />Whether such practices, have been the culmination of interaction of<br />Siddhas and Sufis, or prove the influence of Siddhas on Sufis or<br />they have been derived from the non-Indian Sufis. The paraphernalia<br />of Kandhuri, Urs and other festivals celebrated resembles Hindus<br />counterparts and in fact, many Hindus participate in such festivals<br />along with Muslim brethren. Though Islamic scholars assertively and<br />vigorously claim that in Islam there is no Sufism, but there are<br />Muslims who accept Sufism should note these aspects for the unity of<br />humanity instead of dividing.<br /><br />The Nayaga-Nayagibhava: Treating God as lover by the Mystic poets is<br />not at all new for any traditional society, as it is found in the<br />Persian literature also, as it is closely associated with the<br />development of Sufism. Omar Khayyam, Hafis and Jalalluddhin Rumi<br />have extensively used this bhava / tend / point of view in their<br />literature and made it Bakthi literature. If the words bakthi and<br />God are substituted in the place of wine and woman, the real meaning<br />is easily revealed in such poems. In such proper reading only, how<br />the Sufis have been deeply immersed in the ocean of Bakthi so that<br />their poems are soaked with Bakthi, making one cry at the time of<br />rendering and heart and soul think only about God, to reach God<br />could be understood62. It is important to note that the Siddhas and<br />Sufis have extensively used such simile and metaphor in their<br />literature. Though, some Muslim scholars try to interpret that Sufis<br />always consider God as "Male", there are references, where God is<br />considered as "Female" also. In Indian tradition, this one of the<br />paths of Bakthi marga through which a baktha / devotee can approach<br />God. As the Sufi poets of Tamizhagam have been definitely influenced<br />by such Bakti movement, they have used such bhava in their<br />literature exhibited through Gunangudi Mastan, Shaik Bhava Shaik<br />Sulaiman, Pir Mohammed Mastan, Rasul Bivi and others. That in Islam<br />also, this type of Mysticism has been accepted is revealed through<br />many examples. Shadhiya Gawarkhan Kisti and Victor Daner63 point<br />out how Rabiyath al-Adhawwiya (780-801 CE), belonged to Basra was<br />devoted to God through such Mystic love. Therefore considering such<br />tradition and also familiar with Andal and Tulukka Nachiyar, the<br />Tamil Sufis must have adapted and adopted such approach in their<br />poems.<br /><br />Note: The western / modern scholars used the expressions Bridal<br />Mysticism and Erotic Mysticism for this aspect. The expression<br />Bridal Mysticism may be acceptable, but Erotic Mysticism is not, as<br />it conveys perverted meaning.<br /><br />Conclusion: In the divine pursuit of Tamil Siddhas and Sufis, many<br />similar aspects are noted in the historical perspective. Though, men<br />appear to be divided on many factors like religion, language,<br />culture, social status, they are in fact united together based on<br />other factors which are the basic instincts of the humanity.<br />Definitely, they have come together in their pursuit of God through<br />Unity in Diversity and Diversity in unity approaches. Mahmud<br />Shabistari64, in his beautiful poetry, Garden of Mystery says, "See<br />One. Say One, Know One". When Quaran says, "Say: God is One"<br />(112:1), Siddhas proclaim, "Onre Kulam, Oruvane Deivam = Only One<br />Humanity and One God". After declaring, "La ilaha illa Llah Muhammad<br />rasula Llah = There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is the Only<br />Prophet", the assertion, "Khul hu vallahu ahad = Only One" clearly<br />brings out the above concept. First the existence of God is asserted<br />in double negative expression, "La ilaha illa Llah" and then,<br />exclusively with "Khul hu vallahu ahad". Here only, the innate<br />Sufist principle is appreciated.<br /><br />Thus, the Siddhas and Sufis have been nearer, together and<br />interacted many times, though, they appear to be at distance or<br />differ externally. In Tamizhagam, definitely, they have moved<br />together, interacted and had encounters with each other in<br />historical perspective as discussed above. Based on the above<br />observations, inference and arguments, the following conclusions are<br />drawn: <br /><br />1. During the 7th century and thereafter, particularly Abbasid<br />period, the meetings and encounters of Siddhas and Sufis would have<br />taken place.<br />2. The established Indo-Persian connections prove the<br />possibilities of 11th ? 12th century meetings.<br />3. If the details of visits of Ramadeva and Bogar to Mecca, the<br />works attributed to Jasbir ibn Hayyan, Omar Khayyam etc., are<br />critically analyzed cross checking with Persian and Arabic sources,<br />such meetings could be strengthened and more facts could be bropught<br />out in historical perspective.<br />4. According to scholars of history of sciences, Mercury was<br />not available in India and it was obtained from China. The earlier<br />Indo-China sojourns prove the fact. The Arabs might have tried to<br />obtain the rasavada methods from Indians and the Siddha-Sufi<br />encounters in Arabia prove the point.<br />5. If these incidences established after critical analysis, the<br />interpolations in the Siddha-Sufi literature can be weeded out and<br />expunged.<br />6. If the contacts of Nishapur / Iran and South India are<br />studied thoroughly, more facts about the Siddha-Sufi contacts might<br />come out.<br />7. Instead of making generalizations as "Siddhas" and "Sufis",<br />they have to be identified as such separating from the poets,<br />scholars and religious sect headers.<br />8. The chronology of Siddhas is divided into four periods - 1.<br />Up tp Tirumular, 2. 7th to 12th century, 3. Up to 13th century, 4 up<br />to 20th century.<br />9. The chronology of Tamil Sufis is divided into four periods ?<br />1. Up to Yacob / Ramadeva, 2. Up to Pir Mohammed appa, 3. Up to<br />Gunangudi Mastan, 4. 20th century onwards.<br />10. Islamization checks, controls and restricts the studies of<br />Sufism.<br />11. As the meetings / encounters of Siddhas and Sufis had taken<br />place recently, the dates could be determined and fixed accurately<br />from the source materials. Then, more light can be thrown on the<br />social, cultural, religious aspects of history. The significance of<br />such meetings / encounters can also be found out and appreciated.<br />12. Common traditional factors can combine different religious<br />thinking with the specific internal symbolism to evolve external<br />symbolism.<br />13. Popular beliefs, traditional prevalent practices and age-old<br />rites, rituals and ceremonies could have made Siddhas and Sufis to<br />come together or the processes of "inculturation" could have<br />necessitated such exigency.<br />14. Nature influences through symmetrical patterns and thus,<br />such symmetry is found in the conceived symbols, signs, marks, lime-<br />light language etc., and later to be converted into external<br />symbolism. Psychologically, hereditary and environmental factors<br />also influence for the symmetrical patterns to be formed.<br />15. As Siddha literature / poems have been classified and<br />published, the Tamil Sufi literature / poems should be classified<br />and published as collection. Such compilation should have authentic<br />history of Sufis, contemporary kings and rulers, Sufis and Siddhas,<br />events with dates.<br /><br /><br />Notes and References<br /><br />The primary sources used are the literature of Siddhas and Sufis in<br />Tamil published during the last 200 years. Some of the songs have<br />been so popular among the commoners and elite.

Ramakrishna Rao, B.Sc., M.A., A.M.I.E.,<br />  C.Eng.&#40;I&#41;., B.L.,<br />  Paper presented during the "World Islamic Tamil<br />  Literary Conference"<br />  held at Colombo, Sri Lanka in October, 2002<br /> <br />  Introduction: About Siddhas and Sufis, so far<br />  Mohammed Abdur Rahman<br />  &#40;1924&#41;, M. Shams &#40;1976&#41;, A. M. Parimanam &#40;1976&#41;, R.<br />  Manickavacagam<br />  &#40;1983&#41;, C. Nayinar Mohammed &#40;1993&#41;, P. Kamalakkannan<br />  &#40;1993&#41;, M.

Here, the comparative studies made<br />  about Hindu-Islam<br />  religions also are considered, as they contain<br />  references about<br />  Siddhas and Sufis2. Originating in the<br />  middle-eastern countries,<br />  developing in Iran, coming to India and mixing with<br />  the factors of<br />  local tradition, culture and heritage, Sufism has<br />  evolved into a<br />  syncretic system in India. The origin of Siddhas has<br />  much more<br />  antiquity than that of Sufis. Though, Siddhas and<br />  their traditions<br />  have been spread throughout India, and even in the<br />  entire world, as<br />  for as the Siddha literature is concerned, the study<br />  has to be<br />  restricted to Tamizhagam. The literature of Sufis is<br />  also available<br />  in many other languages, but it is studied within<br />  the limits of<br />  Tamil literature, and many interesting details are<br />  revealed about<br />  them. As here, the Siddhas and Sufis are studied in<br />  historical<br />  perspective, their original texts are taken as<br />  source material. The<br />  secondary sources are used for interpretations in<br />  the relevant<br />  contexts.<br /> <br />  The Siddhas: The scholars, those who have made<br />  studies on Siddhas,<br />  in their works so far have presented much<br />  contradicting details.<br />  Instead of critically analyzing their literature ?<br />  i. in historical perspective,<br />  ii. fixing their dates based on internal evidences<br />  with other<br />  collateral evidences,<br />  iii. preparing a critical text or edition of their<br />  poems by<br />  pointing out the interpolations etc.,<br />  they have simply mentioned that ? the questions<br />  like,<br />  i. who are Siddhas,<br />  ii. what was their period,<br />  iii. who exactly sang which songs,<br />  iv. how many poems sang etc.,<br />  cannot be answered and so on3. Still some others<br />  have confused the<br />  issue with racial, linguistic and other sectarian<br />  bias to mar the<br />  fruitful study4. Therefore, with the available<br />  evidences, we have to<br />  find plausible and possible answers to the questions<br />  with open mind.<br /> <br />  In Sangam literature, the word "Siddha" is not<br />  found. In Paripadal,<br />  in one place &#40;20:47&#41;, the word "Siddham" is used to<br />  connote "knowledge". Tirumular in his work<br />  Tirumanthiram datable to<br />  4th / 5th / 6th century5, uses many words to denote<br />  and expound the<br />  concept of Siddhars. He uses Siddhu, Cittam,<br />  Siddhasan, Siddhar etc.<br />  He denotes Siddhas through the expression<br />  "Siddhasan" &#40;83, the<br />  number denotes the Sutra of Tirumanthiram&#41;. Then,<br />  specific<br />  word "Sivasiddhar" is used, the "Siddhar" is<br />  mentioned specifically.<br />  Then, it is used in many places &#40;124, 284, 671, 1907<br />  etc&#41;. As he<br />  mentions, "Sivasiddhar", it is evident that there<br />  were other Siddhar<br />  also. He answers in the next Sutra &#40;125&#41; about the<br />  spirituality<br />  level of others ? Siddhar, Nittar, Nimalar, Muttar<br />  etc. Siddhar are<br />  those who have crossed the 36 tatvas. By telling<br />  that there no other<br />  place for Siddhu to reach finally other than Siddhu,<br />  he implies that<br />  the thinking power of man would be restricted to<br />  Cosmic mind. As<br />  there are no four "ca" as in Sanskrit, the scholars<br />  have not given<br />  proper meanings to the words ? Siddha, Cittar,<br />  Siddhi, Cit, Citta<br />  etc. But, Tirumular uses these words properly in the<br />  context to<br />  convey the meanings exactly as follows: <br /> <br />  Cit = the best knowledge or thinking &#40;that is<br />  different<br />  from "acit"&#41;, related to mind<br />  Citta = related to mind, sub-conscious mind and<br />  other layers of mind.<br />  Siddhi = the status of attainment of highest powers,<br />  a state of<br />  perfectness.<br />  Cittu = Mind, the state of mind, the state of<br />  attaining satisfaction<br />  of mind.<br />  Siddhu = miracles beyond the perceptions of man, the<br />  ability to<br />  perform such miracles.<br />  Siddham = thinking, finality, the state of mind, the<br />  refined<br />  thinking process of a perfected mind.<br />  Siddhar = the men who are in such status.<br /> <br />  Sufis: The word "sufi" is derived from the Arabic<br />  words<br />  differently6, and thus "Sufis" are also interpreted<br />  accordingly as<br />  follows: <br /> <br />  1. "safa" = the purity of mind, therefore, the Sufis<br />  are those<br />  who have purified minds. But, safa -  safa -  safavi<br />  to call such<br />  persons as "safavi" and not "Sufis" is the counter<br />  argument.<br />  2. "saf" = the rank or row i.e, the Sufis are the<br />  persons, who<br />  are in the front row before the God or ranked above<br />  all before the<br />  God. But, saf becomes safi and not sufi.<br />  3. Suffa = a chair to sit i.e, there would be chairs<br />  outside<br />  mosques, where the persons who sit there are Sufis.<br />  But, saffa<br />  becomes suffi only and not Sufi.<br />  4. Suf = wool and therefore, those who wore wool<br />  cloth / dress<br />  are called Sufis. Abu Baker al-kalabadhi opines that<br />  this<br />  interpretation fits to the definition of Sufi to<br />  some extent.<br />  5. Sufi might have been derived from the Greek<br />  "Sophia" is<br />  another argument.<br /> <br />  Anyway, Sufis are better understood by themselves,<br />  than the<br />  interpretation of the word Sufi. According to the<br />  research of Imam<br />  Queshayri the word Sufi was in vogue before 822 CE /<br />  2nd hijiri.<br />  Syyed Sahabbuddhin Suhravarti notes that though the<br />  word "sufi" is<br />  not found in Quaran, the word used "muharif"<br />  connotes the same<br />  meaning, as "such people are near to God" 7. He also<br />  points out that<br />  usage of such word was not in vogue even after two<br />  hundred years<br />  after the death of Prophet i.e, up to 9th century8<br />  &#40;632 + 200 =<br />  832&#41;. Ajmalkhan points out that during 7th century<br />  only, such group<br />  might have been originated. But, it was not known as<br />  "sufi".<br /> <br />  Sarraj points out that the word "sufi" was used even<br />  during the<br />  period of Tabin i.e, the successors of the friends<br />  of Prophet,<br />  refuting the argument that it was used first by the<br />  people of<br />  Baghdad. To show that the word sufi was current in<br />  the pre-Islamic<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Explore your hobbies and interests.

Still some others<br />    have confused the<br />    issue with racial, linguistic and other sectarian<br />    bias to mar the<br />    fruitful study4. Therefore, with the available<br />    evidences, we have to<br />    find plausible and possible answers to the questions<br />    with open mind.<br />    <br />    In Sangam literature, the word "Siddha" is not<br />    found. In Paripadal,<br />    in one place &#40;20:47&#41;, the word "Siddham" is used to<br />    connote "knowledge". Tirumular in his work<br />    Tirumanthiram datable to<br />    4th / 5th / 6th century5, uses many words to denote<br />    and expound the<br />    concept of Siddhars. He uses Siddhu, Cittam,<br />    Siddhasan, Siddhar etc.<br />    He denotes Siddhas through the expression<br />    "Siddhasan" &#40;83, the<br />    number denotes the Sutra of Tirumanthiram&#41;. Then,<br />    specific<br />    word "Sivasiddhar" is used, the "Siddhar" is<br />    mentioned specifically.<br />    Then, it is used in many places &#40;124, 284, 671, 1907<br />    etc&#41;. As he<br />    mentions, "Sivasiddhar", it is evident that there<br />    were other Siddhar<br />    also. He answers in the next Sutra &#40;125&#41; about the<br />    spirituality<br />    level of others ? Siddhar, Nittar, Nimalar, Muttar<br />    etc. Siddhar are<br />    those who have crossed the 36 tatvas. By telling<br />    that there no other<br />    place for Siddhu to reach finally other than Siddhu,<br />    he implies that<br />    the thinking power of man would be restricted to<br />    Cosmic mind. As<br />    there are no four "ca" as in Sanskrit, the scholars<br />    have not given<br />    proper meanings to the words ? Siddha, Cittar,<br />    Siddhi, Cit, Citta<br />    etc. But, Tirumular uses these words properly in the<br />    context to<br />    convey the meanings exactly as follows: <br />    <br />    Cit = the best knowledge or thinking &#40;that is<br />    different<br />    from "acit"&#41;, related to mind<br />    Citta = related to mind, sub-conscious mind and<br />    other layers of mind.<br />    Siddhi = the status of attainment of highest powers,<br />    a state of<br />    perfectness.<br />    Cittu = Mind, the state of mind, the state of<br />    attaining satisfaction<br />    of mind.<br />    Siddhu = miracles beyond the perceptions of man, the<br />    ability to<br />    perform such miracles.<br />    Siddham = thinking, finality, the state of mind, the<br />    refined<br />    thinking process of a perfected mind.<br />    Siddhar = the men who are in such status.<br />    <br />    Sufis: The word "sufi" is derived from the Arabic<br />    words<br />    differently6, and thus "Sufis" are also interpreted<br />    accordingly as<br />    follows: <br />    <br />    1. "safa" = the purity of mind, therefore, the Sufis<br />    are those<br />    who have purified minds. But, safa -  safa -  safavi<br />    to call such<br />    persons as "safavi" and not "Sufis" is the counter<br />    argument.<br />    2. "saf" = the rank or row i.e, the Sufis are the<br />    persons, who<br />    are in the front row before the God or ranked above<br />    all before the<br />    God. But, saf becomes safi and not sufi.<br />    3. Suffa = a chair to sit i.e, there would be chairs<br />    outside<br />    mosques, where the persons who sit there are Sufis.<br />    But, saffa<br />    becomes suffi only and not Sufi.<br />    4. Suf = wool and therefore, those who wore wool<br />    cloth / dress<br />    are called Sufis. Abu Baker al-kalabadhi opines that<br />    this<br />    interpretation fits to the definition of Sufi to<br />    some extent.<br />    5. Sufi might have been derived from the Greek<br />    "Sophia" is<br />    another argument.<br />    <br />    Anyway, Sufis are better understood by themselves,<br />    than the<br />    interpretation of the word Sufi. According to the<br />    research of Imam<br />    Queshayri the word Sufi was in vogue before 822 CE /<br />    2nd hijiri.<br />    Syyed Sahabbuddhin Suhravarti notes that though the<br />    word "sufi" is<br />    not found in Quaran, the word used "muharif"<br />    connotes the same<br />    meaning, as "such people are near to God" 7. He also<br />    points out that<br />    usage of such word was not in vogue even after two<br />    hundred years<br />    after the death of Prophet i.e, up to 9th century8<br />    &#40;632 + 200 =<br />    832&#41;. Ajmalkhan points out that during 7th century<br />    only, such group<br />    might have been originated. But, it was not known as<br />    "sufi".<br />    <br />    Sarraj points out that the word "sufi" was used even<br />    during the<br />    period of Tabin i.e, the successors of the friends<br />    of Prophet,<br />    refuting the argument that it was used first by the<br />    people of<br />    Baghdad. To show that the word sufi was current in<br />    the pre-Islamic<br />    <br />  === message truncated ===<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Explore your hobbies and interests.
