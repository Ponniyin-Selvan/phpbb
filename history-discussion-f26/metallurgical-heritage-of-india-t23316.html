Srinivasan and S. Ranganathan<br />Department of Metallurgy, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore <br /><br />Introduction <br />  <br />The history of civilization is in many ways linked to the story of <br />the use of metals in antiquity. Although modern metallurgy has seen <br />an exponential growth since the Industrial Revolution it is <br />interesting that many modern concepts in metallurgy have their seeds <br />in ancient practices that pre-date the Industrial Revolution. Metals <br />were extracted and utilized in the past in stages progressing usually <br />from the use of native metal, to those metals which could be smelted <br />easily from ores, to those which were more difficult to smelt. The <br />commonly used metals in antiquity include gold, silver, copper, iron, <br />tin, lead, zinc and mercury. This brief review takes a synoptic look <br />at some aspects of the early use of metal in a global perspective. It <br />throws light on some of the achievements of ancient Indian <br />metallurgists. Its heritage in metallurgy, medicine, mathematics and <br />astronomy is a matter of pride for India. <br />  <br />Copper<br /> <br />Native copper, i.e. copper metal, is thought to have been the first <br />metal used by man and may have used in ancient Turkey and Mesopotamia <br />by about the seventh millennium BC. Native copper is abundantly <br />available in large masses in the Great Lakes region of North America <br />and was used fairly extensively by the North American Indians to make <br />weapons and implements solely by hammering and annealing so that <br />casting and smelting was not attempted. Clear early evidence for <br />smelting copper comes from the Middle East from about the fourth to <br />third millennium BC onwards, from parts of Israel, Jordan and Egypt <br />where copper oxide ores such as green malachite were smelted at <br />temperatures of around 1200oC. <br />Early copper artifacts of about the sixth millennium BC are also <br />reported from the pre-Indus Valley sites of Baluchistan in the <br />northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent close to the Iranian <br />border. There is also some evidence for smelting furnaces from the <br />Harappan civilizations of the northwestern part of the Indian <br />subcontinent. There is fairly extensive evidence for the ancient <br />mining of copper ores from the Khetri region of Rajasthan in <br />northwestern India dating to about the 3rd-2nd millennium BC. <br /><br />  <br />Gold and Silver <br />  <br />The noble metals, gold and silver, are found in the native state, and <br />as is well known, gold and silver were used to make jewelry and sheet <br />metal due to the great ductility and lustre of the pure metals. Some <br />of the early rich finds of gold artifacts were from the cemeteries in <br />Bulgaria in Europe (5th millennium BC) with accouterments of hammered <br />and sheet gold. Some of the most elegant gold vessels made by the <br />repousse technique come from the Mesopotamia (ca 2500 BC). <br />Spectacular gold castings are known from ancient Pharaohnic Egypt, <br />such as the enigmatic face of the young Pharaoh Tutenkhamen (ca 1300 <br />BC). Early gold and silver ornaments from the Indian subcontinent are <br />found from Indus Valley sites such as Mohenjodaro (ca 3000 BC). These <br />are on display in the National Museum, New Delhi. <br />  <br />Some of the most interesting artifacts of gold are the unique tumbaga <br />alloys from medieval South America which are gold-copper-silver <br />alloys of about 40% gold used for making castings and sheet metals. <br />These were chemically treated to give a surface of pure gold. Also <br />from South America comes unique evidence for use of the metal <br />platinum in antiquity where the sintering of platinum granules with <br />gold was practiced. <br />  <br />In antiquity gold would usually have been collected by panning <br />alluvial sands from placer deposits. However India has the <br />distinction that the deepest ancient mines in the world for gold come <br />from the Maski region of Karnataka with carbon dates from the mid 1st <br />millennium BC. A rather delightful piece of conjecture is that tales <br />of Herodotus, the Greek, about ?gold-digging ants? from India refers <br />to marmot, a type of rodent found in Afghanistan, who dig up the <br />river sand which could then have been panned for gold by the <br />inhabitants. Prof. R.K. Dube has produced literary evidence that the <br />ants gold, refer to in the epic Mahabharath must have been actually <br />produced by ants, if the size of the gold powder is any indication. <br />  <br />The interesting technique of granulation of gold in making jewelry <br />was developed in Egypt and was used extensively by the ancient Greeks <br />(ca 600 BC). Surface tension was used to turn melted gold filings <br />into spheres. The granulation technique was also used to make gold <br />jewelry in India in the late 1st millennium BC to early Christian <br />era. Interestingly, as far as silver production goes, the Aravalli <br />region in north-west India along with Laurion in Greece and the Roman <br />mines of Rio Tinto in Spain ranks amongst the few major ancient <br />silver producing sites from about the mid 1st millennium BC onwards. <br />  <br />Zinc <br />  <br />The earliest firm evidence for the production of metallic zinc is <br />from India. Of the metals used in antiquity zinc is one of the most <br />difficult to smelt since zinc volatalises at about the same <br />temperature of around 1000oC that is needed to smelt zinc ore. As a <br />result it would form as a vapour in the furnace which would <br />immediately get reoxidised and hence lost. Hence metallic zinc is <br />seldom reported in antiquity. However in India there is unique <br />evidence for the extensive and semi-industrial production of metallic <br />zinc at the Zawar area of Rajasthan. An ingenious method was devised <br />of downward distillation of the zinc vapour formed after smelting <br />zinc ore using specifically designed retorts with condensers and <br />furnaces, so that the smelted zinc vapour could be drastically cooled <br />down to get a melt that could solidify to zinc metal. The <br />Rasaratnakara, a text ascribed to the great Indian scientist <br />Nagarjuna, of the early Christian era describes this method of <br />production of zinc. <br />  <br />In Europe, the production of metallic zinc was virtually unknown <br />until William Champion first established commercial zinc smelting <br />operations in Bristol in the 1740?s following which it was <br />industrially produced. Interestingly the method of production adopted <br />by downward distillation bears a strong resemblance to the Zawar <br />process and it has been pointed out that Champion?s process was very <br />likely inspired by the Zawar process which would have been made known <br />to the British during the forays of the East India Company. <br />  <br />Another remarkable artistic innovation by Indian metalworkers of the <br />past was the use of zinc in making highly elegant bidri ware, an <br />inlayed zinc alloy, which came into vogue under the Muslim rulers of <br />the Bidar province in the Hyderabad region from about the 14th <br />century. AD. Several impressive vessels, ewers, pitchers, vessels, <br />huqqa bases etc. were made of bidri ware with patterns influenced by <br />the fine geometric and floral patterns and inlayed metal work of the <br />Islamic world where decorative metalwork reached some its most <br />exquisite heights, for instance in the metalwork of the Ottoman <br />empire. <br />  <br />Iron <br />  <br />Iron occurs in the native metal state as meteoric iron which was <br />exploited by the North American Indians to make weapons. Since iron <br />has a high melting point of around 1550oC it was commonly produced in <br />the Old World by reducing the ore to metal in the solid state to <br />produce bloomery iron which was then wrought to give low carbon <br />wrought iron (0.1-0.2 % C). The Hittite kingdom of the mid second <br />millennium BC was one of the major early iron producing centers and <br />was thought to have a monopoly of iron production, and iron <br />production became widespread in Greece and the Mediterranean by the <br />beginning of the 1st millennium BC. Iron seems to have been used in <br />India from about the late second millennium BC and iron smelting and <br />the use of iron was especially well established in the south Indian <br />megalithic cultures of this period.<br /> <br />The forging of wrought iron seems to have reached its zenith in India <br />in the first millennium AD. The earliest large forging is the famous <br />iron pillar at New Delhi dated by inscription to the Gupta period of <br />the 3rd c. AD at a height of over 7 m and weight of about 6 tons. The <br />pillar is believed to have been made by forging together a series of <br />disc-shaped iron blooms. Apart from the dimensions another remarkable <br />aspect of the iron pillar is the absence of corrosion which has been <br />linked to the composition, the high purity of the wrought iron and <br />the phosphorus content and the distribution of slag. <br />  <br />In fact the use of high-carbon iron alloys was developed in parts of <br />Asia before they came into vogue in Europe. We may mention high-<br />carbon steel from India and cast iron from China, both of which <br />required higher furnace temperatures and more reducing conditions <br />than the bloomery iron process. Cast iron was produced in China prior <br />to other parts of the world in small blast furnaces which were <br />precursors to the modern blast furnaces. Cast iron with a high carbon <br />content of between 2-4% C is a brittle and fairly unworkable alloy <br />with poor strength, but it has the lowest melting point in the iron-<br />carbon system being a eutectic at around 1100oC. By the early <br />Christian era in China cast iron was used on a very large scale for <br />producing tools, weapons, vessels and utensils. <br />In Europe the use of cast iron was not appreciated until after about <br />the 14th c. AD when it was used for making cannons. By the end of the <br />18th century cast iron began to be used extensively in England in <br />building and construction. The famous Mysore Palace in Mysore near <br />Bangalore built by the Wodeyars at the turn of the century was the <br />first royal palace in India to make use of cast iron in architectural <br />construction. <br />  <br />Steel <br />  <br />India has been reputed for its iron and steel since Greek and Roman <br />times with the earliest reported finds of high-carbon steels in the <br />world coming from the early Christian era, while Greek accounts <br />report the manufacture of steel in India by the crucible process. <br />Wootz is the anglicized version of ukku in the languages of the <br />states of Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, a term denoting steel. <br />Literary accounts suggest that steel from the southern part of the <br />Indian subcontinent was exported to Europe, China, the Arab world and <br />the Middle East. In the 12th century the Arab Idrisi says ?The Hindus <br />excel in the manufacture of iron. It is impossible to find anything <br />to surpass the edge from Indian steel?. <br />  <br />Studies on Wootz indicate that it was an ultra-high carbon steel with <br />between 1-2% carbon and was believed to have been used to fashion <br />Damascus blades with a watered steel pattern (Srinivasan and <br />Griffiths 1997). Experimental reconstructions by Wadsworth and Sherby <br />in the 1980?s have demonstrated that ultra-high carbon steels with <br />about 1.5% C can be used to simulate ?Damascus? blades and that these <br />exhibit fascinating superplastic properties. Superplasticity is a <br />remarkable phenomenon which allows a material to change its external <br />shape to a very great extent without changing within. <br />  <br />A description from the Crusades of the Damascus blades is as <br />follows: ?One blow of a Damascus sword would cleave a European helmet <br />without turning the edge or cut through a silk handkerchief drawn <br />across it?. One sixth century writer describes blades as having a <br />water pattern whose ?wavy streaks are glistening-it is like a pond on <br />whose surface the wind is gliding?. <br />  <br />Wootz steel also played an important role in the development of <br />metallurgy. Michael Faraday, the greatest experimenter of all times, <br />tried to duplicate the steel by alloying iron with a variety of <br />metallic additions including noble metals but failed. As he was the <br />son of a blacksmith the extraordinary properties of Wootz steel must <br />have fascinated him. His failure had an unexpected and fortunate <br />outcome as it marked the beginning of alloy steel making. Wootz has <br />been a prime motivating force in the development of metallurgical <br />science and the study of micro-structures. Although iron and steel <br />had been used for thousands of years the role of carbon in steel as <br />the dominant element was found only in 1774 by Tobern Bergman and was <br />due to the efforts of Europeans to unravel the mysteries of Wootz. <br />Similarly the textured Damascus steel was one of the earliest <br />materials to be examined by the microscope. British, French and <br />Russian metallography developed largely due to the quest to document <br />this structure. Wootz was an ?advanced material? of the ancient world <br />used in three continents for well over a millennium. Neither its <br />geographic sway nor its historic dominance is likely to be equalled <br />by advanced materials of our era. <br />  <br />Mercury <br />  <br />Mercury is a metal that has been of great alchemical importance in <br />ancient times. In ancient China there is evidence that mercury was <br />used by the latter half of the first millennium BC mercury while <br />mercury metal is reported from Hellenistic Greece. Mercury is a <br />volatile metal which is easily produced by heating cinnabar followed <br />by downward distillation of the mercury vapour. Some of the earliest <br />literary references to the use of mercury distillation comes from <br />Indian treatises such as the Arthashastra of Kautilya dating from the <br />late first millennium BC onwards. Some evidence for mercury <br />distillation is reported from the ancient Roman world. <br />  <br />In India, vermilion or cinnabar i.e. mercuric sulphide has had great <br />ritual significance, typically having been used to make the red bindi <br />or dot on the forehead usually associated with Hinduism. Ingeniously <br />in ancient Chinese tombs cinnabar was used successfully as a <br />preservative to keep fine silks intact. Mercury was also at the heart <br />many alchemical transmutation experiments in the Middle Ages in <br />Europe as well as in Indian alchemical texts which were precursors to <br />the development of chemistry. <br />  <br />Lead <br />  <br />In ancient Predynastic Egypt (ca 4000-3000 BC) galena or lead <br />sulphide was used in the manufacture of kohl or eyeliner and indeed a <br />striking feature of Egyptian art is the beautiful and exaggerated <br />lining of the eyes. Stone palettes for grinding kohl are found in <br />ancient Egypt along with artifacts of lead indicating that lead was <br />one of the earliest metals to be smelted since lead ore is easily <br />reduced and does not require very high temperatures. Lead was <br />commonly alloyed with copper and bronze for making castings. In De Re <br />Metallica, a Renaissance period text authored by Agricola more than <br />five centuries ago, the Westphalian process of smelting lead ore is <br />described where lead ore is smelted in an open hearth. The mineral-<br />rich Aravalli region of Rajasthan was one of the important early lead <br />mining regions in antiquity. The use of low melting lead-tin eutectic <br />as a solder became common in Europe by the late medieval period. <br />  <br />  <br />Tin <br />  <br />Tin ore occurs as alluvial deposits as well as ore bodies. One of the <br />most extensive tin mining regions in the past was Cornwall in Britain <br />which is thought to have been mined at least by Roman times while <br />Southeast Asia has some of the largest alluvial tin deposits. Tin was <br />alloyed to copper to get harder bronze for making weapons, prior to <br />the use of iron, in the Bronze Age cultures of the world. Tin mines <br />are known from ancient Turkey dating to the third millennium BC. <br />Amongst the earliest bronze castings in the world is the well <br />executed statue of a dancing girl from Mohenjodaro from the Indus <br />Valley, while beautiful bronzes are also known from ancient Egypt <br />such as the famous cat which are thought to have been executed by the <br />lost wax technique. In China very impressive ceremonial vessels were <br />cast into clay moulds by the late second millennium BC to early first <br />millennium BC. The Greek bronze figurines of the first millennium BC <br />are well known. Some of the most beautiful and well executed bronze <br />castings in the world are the icons from the Chola period in the <br />Tanjavur area of south India (ca 10th c. AD). South Indian bronzes <br />were mostly solid cast whereas images from Southeast Asia are mostly <br />hollow cast. Mirrors were made of bronze in different part of old <br />world including India. Investigations by Srinivasan show that that <br />the earliest and continuing use of artifacts of rapidly quenched high-<br />tin bronzes is from the Indian subcontinent. <br />  <br />Suggestions for further reading <br />  <br />Agrawal, D.

Srinivasan and S. Ranganathan<br />  Department of Metallurgy, Indian Institute of<br />  Science, Bangalore<br /> <br />  Introduction<br /> <br />  The history of civilization is in many ways linked<br />  to the story of<br />  the use of metals in antiquity. Although modern<br />  metallurgy has seen<br />  an exponential growth since the Industrial<br />  Revolution it is<br />  interesting that many modern concepts in metallurgy<br />  have their seeds<br />  in ancient practices that pre-date the Industrial<br />  Revolution. Metals<br />  were extracted and utilized in the past in stages<br />  progressing usually<br />  from the use of native metal, to those metals which<br />  could be smelted<br />  easily from ores, to those which were more difficult<br />  to smelt. The<br />  commonly used metals in antiquity include gold,<br />  silver, copper, iron,<br />  tin, lead, zinc and mercury. This brief review takes<br />  a synoptic look<br />  at some aspects of the early use of metal in a<br />  global perspective. It<br />  throws light on some of the achievements of ancient<br />  Indian<br />  metallurgists. Its heritage in metallurgy, medicine,<br />  mathematics and<br />  astronomy is a matter of pride for India.<br /> <br />  Copper<br /> <br />  Native copper, i.e. copper metal, is thought to have<br />  been the first<br />  metal used by man and may have used in ancient<br />  Turkey and Mesopotamia<br />  by about the seventh millennium BC. Native copper is<br />  abundantly<br />  available in large masses in the Great Lakes region<br />  of North America<br />  and was used fairly extensively by the North<br />  American Indians to make<br />  weapons and implements solely by hammering and<br />  annealing so that<br />  casting and smelting was not attempted. Clear early<br />  evidence for<br />  smelting copper comes from the Middle East from<br />  about the fourth to<br />  third millennium BC onwards, from parts of Israel,<br />  Jordan and Egypt<br />  where copper oxide ores such as green malachite were<br />  smelted at<br />  temperatures of around 1200oC.<br />  Early copper artifacts of about the sixth millennium<br />  BC are also<br />  reported from the pre-Indus Valley sites of<br />  Baluchistan in the<br />  northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent close<br />  to the Iranian<br />  border. There is also some evidence for smelting<br />  furnaces from the<br />  Harappan civilizations of the northwestern part of<br />  the Indian<br />  subcontinent. There is fairly extensive evidence for<br />  the ancient<br />  mining of copper ores from the Khetri region of<br />  Rajasthan in<br />  northwestern India dating to about the 3rd-2nd<br />  millennium BC.<br /> <br /> <br />  Gold and Silver<br /> <br />  The noble metals, gold and silver, are found in the<br />  native state, and<br />  as is well known, gold and silver were used to make<br />  jewelry and sheet<br />  metal due to the great ductility and lustre of the<br />  pure metals. Some<br />  of the early rich finds of gold artifacts were from<br />  the cemeteries in<br />  Bulgaria in Europe &#40;5th millennium BC&#41; with<br />  accouterments of hammered<br />  and sheet gold. Some of the most elegant gold<br />  vessels made by the<br />  repousse technique come from the Mesopotamia &#40;ca<br />  2500 BC&#41;.<br />  Spectacular gold castings are known from ancient<br />  Pharaohnic Egypt,<br />  such as the enigmatic face of the young Pharaoh<br />  Tutenkhamen &#40;ca 1300<br />  BC&#41;. Early gold and silver ornaments from the Indian<br />  subcontinent are<br />  found from Indus Valley sites such as Mohenjodaro<br />  &#40;ca 3000 BC&#41;. These<br />  are on display in the National Museum, New Delhi.<br /> <br />  Some of the most interesting artifacts of gold are<br />  the unique tumbaga<br />  alloys from medieval South America which are<br />  gold-copper-silver<br />  alloys of about 40% gold used for making castings<br />  and sheet metals.<br />  These were chemically treated to give a surface of<br />  pure gold. Also<br />  from South America comes unique evidence for use of<br />  the metal<br />  platinum in antiquity where the sintering of<br />  platinum granules with<br />  gold was practiced.<br /> <br />  In antiquity gold would usually have been collected<br />  by panning<br />  alluvial sands from placer deposits. However India<br />  has the<br />  distinction that the deepest ancient mines in the<br />  world for gold come<br />  from the Maski region of Karnataka with carbon dates<br />  from the mid 1st<br />  millennium BC. A rather delightful piece of<br />  conjecture is that tales<br />  of Herodotus, the Greek, about ?gold-digging ants?<br />  from India refers<br />  to marmot, a type of rodent found in Afghanistan,<br />  who dig up the<br />  river sand which could then have been panned for<br />  gold by the<br />  inhabitants. Prof. R.K. Dube has produced literary<br />  evidence that the<br />  ants gold, refer to in the epic Mahabharath must<br />  have been actually<br />  produced by ants, if the size of the gold powder is<br />  any indication.<br /> <br />  The interesting technique of granulation of gold in<br />  making jewelry<br />  was developed in Egypt and was used extensively by<br />  the ancient Greeks<br />  &#40;ca 600 BC&#41;. Surface tension was used to turn melted<br />  gold filings<br />  into spheres. The granulation technique was also<br />  used to make gold<br />  jewelry in India in the late 1st millennium BC to<br />  early Christian<br />  era. Interestingly, as far as silver production<br />  goes, the Aravalli<br />  region in north-west India along with Laurion in<br />  Greece and the Roman<br />  mines of Rio Tinto in Spain ranks amongst the few<br />  major ancient<br />  silver producing sites from about the mid 1st<br />  millennium BC onwards.<br /> <br />  Zinc<br /> <br />  The earliest firm evidence for the production of<br />  metallic zinc is<br />  from India. Of the metals used in antiquity zinc is<br />  one of the most<br />  difficult to smelt since zinc volatalises at about<br />  the same<br />  temperature of around 1000oC that is needed to smelt<br />  zinc ore. As a<br />  result it would form as a vapour in the furnace<br />  which would<br />  immediately get reoxidised and hence lost. Hence<br />  metallic zinc is<br />  seldom reported in antiquity. However in India there<br />  is unique<br />  evidence for the extensive and semi-industrial<br />  production of metallic<br />  zinc at the Zawar area of Rajasthan. An ingenious<br />  method was devised<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br />Warm Regards,<br /><br />Deepa Prakash<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Do you Yahoo!?<br />Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
