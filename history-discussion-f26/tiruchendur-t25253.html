			<div class="content"><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Unfortunate ! The Temple that drove back Tsunami !<br />  <br />  sps</div></blockquote>Have been to this temple so many times, during the early days - it <br />was truly a spiritual experience, combined with the pleasures of <br />eating sillu karuppatti, buying mara choppu sets and ofcourse <br />watching the temple elephants given a bath and body scrub with <br />coconut husk n sengal...but the last few times, the place has become <br />very commerical and you see touts / guides even inside the sanctum <br />santorium.<br /><br />but alas, during all those trips i was blind to history ... which <br />makes me feel bad when i read below....it was there but i was not <br />awake to realise..<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm">http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There are four lithic inscriptions of the Pandya times collected <br />together and planted now in a line in the southeastern corner of the <br />first circuit of the temple. Two of them belong to Pandya Varaguna <br />Maran of about 875 A.C.; the third of Pandya Mara Varman of about <br />1282 A.C.; and the fourth of Vikrama Pandya Deva. The inscriptions <br />of Varaguna speaks of his grant of 1,400 gold kasus or coins to the <br />temple, and the injunction that this sum should be invested as a <br />permanent loan among village assemblies, so that the interest <br />therefrom might be spent on this temple. <br /><br />There is a mention of a shrine to Nakkira Deva, which speaks highly <br />of the literary advancement of the period, when famous poets were <br />deified and worshipped. Nakkirar was the President of the third <br />Tamil academy of poets at Madura and also the author of Tiru-murug-<br />arruppada the first of the Ten Idylls, known as Pathu Pattu; also <br />other works of high literary merit. The descriptive contents of the <br />inscriptions under reference are given below.* The fifth inscription <br />pertains to the local town temple. <br /><br />No. 26 of 1912 (Vatteluttu) on two slabs set up in the Subrahmanya <br />temple. A record in the 13th year of the Pandya king Varaguna <br />Maraya. The inscription was partially copied in 1903. Registers that <br />the king who was a devotee of Subrahmania Bahtara provided 1,400 <br />gold coins (kasus) for the requirements of the temple throughout the <br />twelve months of the year. The money was distributed amongst the <br />sixteen villages which were required only to pay interest at two <br />kalams of paddy per year on each kasu borrowed, without disturbing <br />the principal (Note the rate of interest.) <br />No. 27 of 1912 (Tamil) on a stone pillar set up in the same place. A <br />record in the 13th year of the Pandya king Maravarman alias <br />Tirubuvanachakravarti Konermaikondan Vikrama Pandya Deva. Records <br />gift of two mass of land at Mankalakkurichi in Tiruvaladivalanadu to <br />a Brahmana of Parakrama Pandya Chaturvedimangalam in Karungudinadu. <br />(The king may be identical with him who came to the throne in A.D. <br />1282 and was the conqueror of Viraganda Gopala and Ganapati. Mr. <br />Krishna Sastri, however, believes that he was perhaps a contemporary <br />of Arikesari Parakrama, founder of the Tenkasi temple, as <br />Kaliyugaraman was). <br />No. 28 of 1912 (Tamil) on the same pillar. Records in Kollam Era <br />621, sale of land mentioned in No. 27 to Nakkiradeva Nayanar in the <br />temple of Subrahmania Pillaiyar at Tiruchendil for 630 <br />Kaliyugaranian panam (named after Vira Pandya, the contemporary of <br />Arikesari Parakrama). It is stated that this land which was at <br />Mangalakurichi alias Perunkarnunai Chaturvedimangalam was originally <br />granted to the Brahmana Atthigirinatha Bhattar and two others of <br />Parakrama Pandya Chaturvedimangalam by Ranarangarania Perumal alias <br />Vikrama Pandya Deva. The dedication of a shrine to Nakkira shows the <br />importance attached to in the age to literary greatness. <br />No. 155 of 1903 (Vattehittu) On a slab set up in the second prakara <br />of the Subrahmania temple. A record in the 13th year of Varaguna <br />Marayaharaja II. Records, gifts of money. The object of the <br />inscriptions is thus stated in order to meet the annual requirements <br />of the temple of Subrahmania-Bhatra, which was the deity in the <br />central shrine (Tirumulattanam) at Tiruchendur, Varaguna Maharaja <br />made a grant of 1,400 kasu and entrusted the amount to three of his <br />officers, viz., Iruppaikkudi-Kilavan, Sattamperuman and <br />Alarruranattukkon, with the stipulation that the money should be <br />lent out and with the interest accruing therefrom, the annual <br />requirements of the temple should be met, the capital always <br />remaining intact. No. 156 of 1903 (Tamil)-On the west and southwest <br />walls, of the Sivakkolundiswara temple at Tiruchendur. An incomplete <br />record in Kollam Era 650, Tiruchendr was also called Madevi-<br />Chaturvedil-mangalam</div>
