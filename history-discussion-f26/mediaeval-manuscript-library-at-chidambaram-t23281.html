It refers to the maintenance of the Library, conservation <br />of its palm leaf manuscripts collections, recopying old worn our <br />manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the copying the Mss and such <br />other works. The manuscripts preserved in the Library were in <br />different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits were appointed for <br />copying manuscripts. Their work not only included copying on new <br />leaves but also comparing them with the original manuscripts. There <br />were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were recopied. Among <br />many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta Ratnakara receives <br />special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of the Library who <br />supervised the development of the Library, the works of the Pundits, <br />and also the administration of the manuscripts Library.<br /><br /> <br /><br />It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to denote the <br />Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial Chola times, <br />particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many Rajagurus are <br />mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the Royal inscriptions<br />[4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The Swamidevar <br />mentioned in the record served obviously as the Rajaguru. It is <br />interesting to note that another inscription from Chidambaram, dated <br />one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of Pallava chieftain <br />Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a Royal priest <br />(Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the Uttara-patha. This <br />Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam Udaiyan who made a <br />gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the same Isvara Siva who  <br />supervised the Manuscript Library at Chidambaram. <br /><br /> <br /><br />I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription on the Manuscript <br />Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />among the manuscripts collection. It is known that the Royal <br />preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the text Siddhanta <br />Ratnakara<br /><br />around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the record is the same <br />written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text has not survived. <br />The other point worthy of note is that this Royal preceptor was also <br />named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author of the text and <br />the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the same. The <br />manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati Bhandara <br />i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription. It would thus be <br />evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence in the <br />Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga II, (1150 CE)<br />before the time of the Pandyan record.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on the lives of <br />Saivite NayanmÂ¡rs was written in Chidambarm. It is well known that <br />Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in writing his work. His <br />work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not unlikely that <br />he had access to a manuscript Library when he composed his text. <br />Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga II (1133 to <br />1150). This would take the date of the Library to the mid 12th Cent.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts made by one <br />Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and his son Vikrama <br />Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among various gifts he made <br />is a unique work that deserves special attention. He got all the <br />Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about 8000 verses <br />engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the Chidambaram <br />temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses should have been <br />deposited in the Library of the temple. This would advance the date <br />of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.<br /><br /> <br /><br />An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns is the <br />discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and Nambi Andar <br />Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text ascribed to <br />Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja discovered the <br />Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a locked room, in a <br />corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja discovered them, a <br />considerable number of the leaves of the text were eaten by white <br />ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant hill. Obviously <br />these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in a state of <br />neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The event points <br />out to the existence of the Library in the time of Rajaraja in the <br />beginning of the 11th cent.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover the manuscripts <br />wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63 Saivite saints.[10] <br />The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is known that this <br />text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of Saint Sundaramurti <br />Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with the praise of <br />the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram (Tillai vaz antÂ¸ar). Also it <br />gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously Nambi Andar <br />Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when he discovered <br />the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in Umapati's work  <br />avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the north western <br />corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja temple. The image of <br />Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the direction where the <br />room with the manuscripts was located. The inscription of Sundara <br />Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found in the north <br />western wall of the second enclosure, where the library is said to <br />have been located. The existence of the manuscript library could <br />now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in the 8th cent. <br />The library existed with fluctuating fortunes for nearly 500 years <br />in the temple of Nataraja.</div>

The list follows a random sequence, being neither <br />chronological, nor alphabetical, nor grouped according to caste or <br />occupation. Since Sundarar sang the glory of the saints at the <br />command of God Siva himself, the list became a sanctified one. It <br />was elaborated by Nambi-Andar-Nambi in the tenth century and <br />codified by Sekkilaar in the twelfth-century work Â— the Periya-<br />Puranam Â— but the sequence remained unaltered. The order of this <br />list is meticulously followed in the temples for the placement of <br />bronze or stone images of the Nayanars, as also for their figures on <br />the temple walls.<br /><br /> <br /><br />God Siva's 63 Nayanars:<br />(as given by Saint Sundarar)<br /><br />01.

It refers to the maintenance of the<br />  Library, conservation<br />  of its palm leaf manuscripts collections, recopying<br />  old worn our<br />  manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the copying<br />  the Mss and such<br />  other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />  Library were in<br />  different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits<br />  were appointed for<br />  copying manuscripts. Their work not only included<br />  copying on new<br />  leaves but also comparing them with the original<br />  manuscripts. There<br />  were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were<br />  recopied. Among<br />  many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />  Ratnakara receives<br />  special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of the<br />  Library who<br />  supervised the development of the Library, the works<br />  of the Pundits,<br />  and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />  Library.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />  denote the<br />  Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial Chola<br />  times,<br />  particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />  Rajagurus are<br />  mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />  Royal inscriptions<br />  [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />  Swamidevar<br />  mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />  Rajaguru. It is<br />  interesting to note that another inscription from<br />  Chidambaram, dated<br />  one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of Pallava<br />  chieftain<br />  Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a<br />  Royal priest<br />  &#40;Udaiyar&#41; who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the<br />  Uttara-patha. This<br />  Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />  Udaiyan who made a<br />  gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the same<br />  Isvara Siva who<br />  supervised the Manuscript Library at Chidambaram.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription<br />  on the Manuscript<br />  Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />  Siddhanta ratnakara<br />  among the manuscripts collection. It is known that<br />  the Royal<br />  preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the text<br />  Siddhanta<br />  Ratnakara<br /> <br />  around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the record<br />  is the same<br />  written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text has<br />  not survived.<br />  The other point worthy of note is that this Royal<br />  preceptor was also<br />  named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author<br />  of the text and<br />  the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the<br />  same. The<br />  manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati<br />  Bhandara<br />  i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription.<br />  It would thus be<br />  evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence<br />  in the<br />  Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga<br />  II, &#40;1150 CE&#41;<br />  before the time of the Pandyan record.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on<br />  the lives of<br />  Saivite NayanmÂ¡rs was written in Chidambarm. It is<br />  well known that<br />  Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />  writing his work. His<br />  work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not<br />  unlikely that<br />  he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />  composed his text.<br />  Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga<br />  II &#40;1133 to<br />  1150&#41;. This would take the date of the Library to<br />  the mid 12th Cent.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts<br />  made by one<br />  Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and<br />  his son Vikrama<br />  Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />  various gifts he made<br />  is a unique work that deserves special attention. He<br />  got all the<br />  Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about<br />  8000 verses<br />  engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the<br />  Chidambaram<br />  temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />  should have been<br />  deposited in the Library of the temple. This would<br />  advance the date<br />  of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns<br />  is the<br />  discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and<br />  Nambi Andar<br />  Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text<br />  ascribed to<br />  Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja<br />  discovered the<br />  Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a<br />  locked room, in a<br />  corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja<br />  discovered them, a<br />  considerable number of the leaves of the text were<br />  eaten by white<br />  ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant<br />  hill. Obviously<br />  these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in<br />  a state of<br />  neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The<br />  event points<br />  out to the existence of the Library in the time of<br />  Rajaraja in the<br />  beginning of the 11th cent.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover<br />  the manuscripts<br />  wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63<br />  Saivite saints.[10]<br />  The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is<br />  known that this<br />  text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of<br />  Saint Sundaramurti<br />  Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with<br />  the praise of<br />  the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram &#40;Tillai vaz<br />  antÂ¸ar&#41;. Also it<br />  gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously<br />  Nambi Andar<br />  Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when<br />  he discovered<br />  the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in<br />  Umapati&#39;s work<br />  avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the<br />  north western<br />  corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja<br />  temple. The image of<br />  Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the<br />  direction where the<br />  room with the manuscripts was located. The<br />  inscription of Sundara<br />  Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found<br />  in the north<br />  western wall of the second enclosure, where the<br />  library is said to<br />  have been located. The existence of the manuscript<br />  library could<br />  now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in<br />  the 8th cent.<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Choose the right car based on your needs.

It refers to the maintenance of the<br />      Library, conservation<br />      of its palm leaf manuscripts collections,<br />  recopying<br />      old worn our<br />      manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the<br />  copying<br />      the Mss and such<br />      other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />      Library were in<br />      different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits<br />      were appointed for<br />      copying manuscripts. Their work not only<br />  included<br />      copying on new<br />      leaves but also comparing them with the original<br />      manuscripts. There<br />      were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were<br />      recopied. Among<br />      many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />      Ratnakara receives<br />      special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of<br />  the<br />      Library who<br />      supervised the development of the Library, the<br />  works<br />      of the Pundits,<br />      and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />      Library.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />      denote the<br />      Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />  Chola<br />      times,<br />      particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />      Rajagurus are<br />      mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />      Royal inscriptions<br />      [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />      Swamidevar<br />      mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />      Rajaguru. It is<br />      interesting to note that another inscription<br />  from<br />      Chidambaram, dated<br />      one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of<br />  Pallava<br />      chieftain<br />      Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a<br />      Royal priest<br />      &#40;Udaiyar&#41; who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the<br />      Uttara-patha. This<br />      Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />      Udaiyan who made a<br />      gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the<br />  same<br />      Isvara Siva who<br />      supervised the Manuscript Library at<br />  Chidambaram.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram<br />  inscription<br />      on the Manuscript<br />      Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />      Siddhanta ratnakara<br />      among the manuscripts collection. It is known<br />  that<br />      the Royal<br />      preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the<br />  text<br />      Siddhanta<br />      Ratnakara<br />     <br />      around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the<br />  record<br />      is the same<br />      written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text<br />  has<br />      not survived.<br />      The other point worthy of note is that this<br />  Royal<br />      preceptor was also<br />      named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the<br />  author<br />      of the text and<br />      the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were<br />  the<br />      same. The<br />      manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called<br />  Sarswati<br />      Bhandara<br />      i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in<br />  inscription.<br />      It would thus be<br />      evident that the Manuscript Library was in<br />  existence<br />      in the<br />      Chidambaram temple even from the time of<br />  Kulottunga<br />      II, &#40;1150 CE&#41;<br />      before the time of the Pandyan record.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar<br />  on<br />      the lives of<br />      Saivite NayanmÂ¡rs was written in Chidambarm. It<br />  is<br />      well known that<br />      Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />      writing his work. His<br />      work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is<br />  not<br />      unlikely that<br />      he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />      composed his text.<br />      Sekkilar was at first a court poet under<br />  Kulottunga<br />      II &#40;1133 to<br />      1150&#41;. This would take the date of the Library<br />  to<br />      the mid 12th Cent.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Another record at Chidambaram mentions many<br />  gifts<br />      made by one<br />      Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I<br />  and<br />      his son Vikrama<br />      Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />      various gifts he made<br />      is a unique work that deserves special<br />  attention. He<br />      got all the<br />      Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering<br />  about<br />      8000 verses<br />      engraved on copper plates and deposited them in<br />  the<br />      Chidambaram<br />      temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />      should have been<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Luggage?

Unfortunately this text has<br />      not survived. <br />      The other point worthy of note is that this Royal<br />      preceptor was also <br />      named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author<br />      of the text and <br />      the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the<br />      same. The <br />      manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati<br />      Bhandara <br />      i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription.<br />      It would thus be <br />      evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence<br />      in the <br />      Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga<br />      II, &#40;1150 CE&#41;<br />      before the time of the Pandyan record.<br />      <br />       <br />      <br />      The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on<br />      the lives of <br />      Saivite NayanmÂ¡rs was written in Chidambarm.

This would take the date of the Library to<br />      the mid 12th Cent.<br />      <br />       <br />      <br />      Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts<br />      made by one <br />      Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and<br />      his son Vikrama <br />      Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />      various gifts he made <br />      is a unique work that deserves special attention. He<br />      got all the <br />      Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about<br />      8000 verses <br />      engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the<br />      Chidambaram <br />      temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />      should have been <br />      deposited in the Library of the temple. This would<br />      advance the date <br />      of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.<br />      <br />       <br />      <br />      An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns<br />      is the <br />      discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and<br />      Nambi Andar <br />      Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text<br />      ascribed to <br />      Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja<br />      discovered the <br />      Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a<br />      locked room, in a <br />      corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja<br />      discovered them, a <br />      considerable number of the leaves of the text were<br />      eaten by white <br />      ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant<br />      hill. Obviously <br />      these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in<br />      a state of <br />      neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The<br />      event points <br />      out to the existence of the Library in the time of<br />      Rajaraja in the <br />      beginning of the 11th cent.<br />      <br />       <br />      <br />      Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover<br />      the manuscripts <br />      wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63<br />      Saivite saints.[10] <br />      The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is<br />      known that this <br />      text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of<br />      Saint Sundaramurti <br />      Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with<br />      the praise of <br />      the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram &#40;Tillai vaz<br />      antÂ¸ar&#41;. Also it <br />      gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously<br />      Nambi Andar <br />      Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when<br />      he discovered <br />      the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in<br />      Umapati&#39;s work  <br />      avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the<br />      north western <br />      corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja<br />      temple. The image of <br />      Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the<br />      direction where the <br />      room with the manuscripts was located. The<br />      inscription of Sundara <br />      Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found<br />      in the north <br />      western wall of the second enclosure, where the<br />      library is said to <br />      have been located. The existence of the manuscript<br />      library could <br />      now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in<br />      the 8th cent. <br />      <br />    === message truncated ===<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />           <br />    <br />  <br />_____________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>_______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Choose the right car based on your needs.

			<div class="content">Hi Vijay,<br /><br />Where do you live? You are sending so much of valuable<br />information everyday...

It refers to the maintenance of the<br />        Library, conservation<br />        of its palm leaf manuscripts collections,<br />  recopying<br />        old worn our<br />        manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the<br />  copying<br />        the Mss and such<br />        other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />        Library were in<br />        different languages and scripts. Twenty<br />  Pundits<br />        were appointed for<br />        copying manuscripts. Their work not only<br />  included<br />        copying on new<br />        leaves but also comparing them with the<br />  original<br />        manuscripts. There<br />        were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which<br />  were<br />        recopied. Among<br />        many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />        Ratnakara receives<br />        special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge<br />  of the<br />        Library who<br />        supervised the development of the Library, the<br />  works<br />        of the Pundits,<br />        and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />        Library.<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        It is known that the word Swamidevar was used<br />  to<br />        denote the<br />        Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />  Chola<br />        times,<br />        particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3].<br />  Many<br />        Rajagurus are<br />        mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in<br />  the<br />        Royal inscriptions<br />        [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5].<br />  The<br />        Swamidevar<br />        mentioned in the record served obviously as<br />  the<br />        Rajaguru. It is<br />        interesting to note that another inscription<br />  from<br />        Chidambaram, dated<br />        one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of<br />  Pallava<br />        chieftain<br />        Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva ,<br />  a<br />        Royal priest<br />        &#40;Udaiyar&#41; who hailed from Dakshina Radha in<br />  the<br />        Uttara-patha. This<br />        Isvara Siva had another name<br />  Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />        Udaiyan who made a<br />        gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the<br />  same<br />        Isvara Siva who<br />        supervised the Manuscript Library at<br />  Chidambaram.<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram<br />  inscription<br />        on the Manuscript<br />        Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />        Siddhanta ratnakara<br />        among the manuscripts collection. It is known<br />  that<br />        the Royal<br />        preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the<br />  text<br />        Siddhanta<br />        Ratnakara<br />       <br />        around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the<br />  record<br />        is the same<br />        written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this<br />  text has<br />        not survived.<br />        The other point worthy of note is that this<br />  Royal<br />        preceptor was also<br />        named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the<br />  author<br />        of the text and<br />        the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were<br />  the<br />        same.

It refers to the maintenance of the<br />            Library, conservation <br />            of its palm leaf manuscripts collections,<br />      recopying<br />            old worn our <br />            manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the<br />      copying<br />            the Mss and such <br />            other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />            Library were in <br />            different languages and scripts. Twenty<br />      Pundits<br />            were appointed for <br />            copying manuscripts. Their work not only<br />      included<br />            copying on new <br />            leaves but also comparing them with the<br />      original<br />            manuscripts. There <br />            were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which<br />      were<br />            recopied. Among <br />            many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />            Ratnakara receives <br />            special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge<br />      of the<br />            Library who <br />            supervised the development of the Library, the<br />      works<br />            of the Pundits, <br />            and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />            Library.<br />            <br />             <br />            <br />            It is known that the word Swamidevar was used<br />      to<br />            denote the <br />            Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />      Chola<br />            times, <br />            particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3].<br />      Many<br />            Rajagurus are <br />            mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in<br />      the<br />            Royal inscriptions<br />            [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5].<br />      The<br />            Swamidevar <br />            mentioned in the record served obviously as<br />      the<br />            Rajaguru. It is <br />            interesting to note that another inscription<br />      from<br />            Chidambaram, dated <br />            one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of<br />      Pallava<br />            chieftain <br />            Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva ,<br />      a<br />            Royal priest <br />            &#40;Udaiyar&#41; who hailed from Dakshina Radha in<br />      the<br />            Uttara-patha. This <br />            Isvara Siva had another name<br />      Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />            Udaiyan who made a <br />            gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the<br />      same<br />            Isvara Siva who  <br />            supervised the Manuscript Library at<br />      Chidambaram. <br />            <br />             <br />            <br />            I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram<br />      inscription<br />            on the Manuscript <br />            Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />            Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />            among the manuscripts collection. It is known<br />      that<br />            the Royal <br />            preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the<br />      text<br />            Siddhanta <br />            Ratnakara<br />            <br />            around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the<br />      record<br />            is the same <br />            written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this<br />      text has<br />            not survived. <br />            The other point worthy of note is that this<br />      Royal<br />            preceptor was also <br />            named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the<br />      author<br />            of the text and <br />            the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were<br />      the<br />            same.

It<br />    is<br />        well known that <br />        Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />        writing his work. His <br />        work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is<br />    not<br />        unlikely that <br />        he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />        composed his text. <br />        Sekkilar was at first a court poet under<br />    Kulottunga<br />        II &#40;1133 to <br />        1150&#41;. This would take the date of the Library<br />    to<br />        the mid 12th Cent.<br />        <br />         <br />        <br />        Another record at Chidambaram mentions many<br />    gifts<br />        made by one <br />        Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I<br />    and<br />        his son Vikrama <br />        Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />        various gifts he made <br />        is a unique work that deserves special<br />    attention. He<br />        got all the <br />        Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering<br />    about<br />        8000 verses <br />        engraved on copper plates and deposited them in<br />    the<br />        Chidambaram <br />        temple[9].
