			<div class="content">anaivarukkum iniya puthandu vazhthukkal.......<br /><br />Hope the new year sees many more great events in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group... wishing good luck to all the <br />new plans that we have ahead....<br /><br />Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after talking with my friend in <br />Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new year. The happenings in <br />TN disturbed me....<br /><br />This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and even the moderators might be <br />requested to delete this posting......<br /><br />I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the new year is only 2 or 3 <br />compared to the previous years...Hope people got me where I am coming to....<br /><br />THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to celebrate Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from a few. I was shocked to hear <br />from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..<br /><br />I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people say that this group is not <br />the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly in our groups purview. When we <br />say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this not a big hitto our culture?<br /><br />'Nenju porukudhillaye..intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont have the back bone to fight <br />against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I talked with my friend around <br />1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. Wondering where the country is <br />heading.. <br /><br />Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even a mention of this in our <br />group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the new year. If tanjai periya <br />koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest saying that its a hit for our <br />culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?<br /><br />who gave these people such authority to change religious things as they wish. Will these <br />people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam eout of Indiawe should not <br />follow that calendar? <br /><br />Ravi, <br /><br />I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu mythology. I used to think in <br />those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel these are also mini <br />pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. <br /><br />If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the caveat of creamy layer, our <br />so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit the criteria for creamy <br />layer..<br /><br /><br />For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state and the country, say that <br />without these people their community could not have improved, I like to quote Swami <br />Chinmayananda,<br /><br />'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they could have donebetter, if the <br />situations were different'.<br /><br />How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will be bashing the hindu and <br />their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but who the hellare they to say <br />that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? <br /><br />Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not on the streets. <br /><br />Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what should be written in this <br />group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try to brush things under the <br />carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and gain and spread knowledge <br />about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion theory is a myth, we still <br />stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.<br /><br />And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and preserve culture, but dont <br />spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br /><br />Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from others perspective, this mail is <br />surely not related this group.<br /><br />God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Satish, your passion is well placed. I also hear that<br />temples are not allowed to read 'panchangam' and are<br />being forced to abide by english new year. I am very<br />much shocked myself. But at this time I believe there<br />are more things to be shocked. The food crisis is #1<br />on the list. Farmers are committing suicide more than<br />ever. No vegetable is less than 40 Rs per kg and riots<br />are happening all over the world.<br /><br />As a humanist first and foremost I prefer to pay heed<br />to this more than what the stupid DMK government does.<br />Our religion and tradition has survived years of<br />assault and will survive this also.<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>anaivarukkum iniya puthandu vazhthukkal.......<br /> <br />  Hope the new year sees many more great events in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />  group... wishing good luck to all the<br />  new plans that we have ahead....<br /> <br />  Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really<br />  happy, after talking with my friend in<br />  Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish<br />  for the new year.

I talked with my friend around <br />1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. Wondering where the country is <br />heading.. <br /><br />Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even a mention of this in our <br />group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the new year. If tanjai periya <br />koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest saying that its a hit for our <br />culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?<br /><br />who gave these people such authority to change religious things as they wish.

I used to think in <br />those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel these are also mini <br />pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. <br /><br />If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the caveat of creamy layer, our <br />so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit the criteria for creamy <br />layer..<br /><br />For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state and the country, say that <br />without these people their community could not have improved, I like to quote Swami <br />Chinmayananda,<br /><br />'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they could have donebetter, if the <br />situations were different'.<br /><br />How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will be bashing the hindu and <br />their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but who the hellare they to say <br />that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? <br /><br />Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not on the streets. <br /><br />Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what should be written in this <br />group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try to brush things under the <br />carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and gain and spread knowledge <br />about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion theory is a myth, we still <br />stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.<br /><br />And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and preserve culture, but dont <br />spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br /><br />Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from others perspective, this mail is <br />surely not related this group.<br /><br />God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />	 <br />	<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Yahoo! for Good helps you make a difference</div>

Will these <br />    people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it <br />cam eout <br />  of India we should not <br />    follow that calendar? <br />    <br />    Ravi, <br />    <br />    I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on <br />Hindu <br />  mythology. I used to think in <br />    those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I <br />feel <br />  these are also mini <br />    pralaya&#39;s where the dharma is being disturbed. <br />    <br />    If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with <br />the <br />  caveat of creamy layer, our <br />    so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will <br />revisit <br />  the criteria for creamy <br />    layer..<br />    <br />    <br />    For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the <br />state and <br />  the country, say that <br />    without these people their community could not have <br />improved, I <br />  like to quote Swami <br />    Chinmayananda,<br />    <br />    &#39;The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />could <br />  have done better, if the <br />    situations were different&#39;.<br />    <br />    How long these atrocities can go on? How long these <br />people will be <br />  bashing the hindu and <br />    their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, <br />but who <br />  the hell are they to say <br />    that panchangam should not be read in the temples on <br />cithirai 1? <br />    <br />    Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if <br />not on <br />  the streets. <br />    <br />    Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and <br />what <br />  should be written in this <br />    group. As rightly pointed out by Arun &#40;is that Arun? &#41; we <br />try to <br />  brush things under the <br />    carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it <br />and <br />  gain and spread knowledge <br />    about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan <br />invasion <br />  theory is a myth, we still <br />    stick to it because talking about it going to create <br />controversy.<br />    <br />    And we say that this group likes to bring out true history <br />and <br />  preserve culture, but dont <br />    spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br />    <br />    Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from <br />others <br />  perspective, this mail is <br />    surely not related this group.<br />    <br />    God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Sri,<br /><br />The 2 or 3 wishes which i mentioned includes those 2 <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But still till <br />last year we had floods of wishes,and even for Jan 1 we do get flooded.<br /><br />Changing Tamil new year from chitirai 1 to thai 1 is ofcourse <br />political, but forcing not to read panchangam in temples on chitirai 1 -<br />what do you want to call it? And if I am not wrong, panchangam is <br />prepared and read by brahmins in most of the temples (or all?). I have <br />never witnessed it so I am not sure who reads it or what they read. But <br />still its a attack on the hindu beliefs. Will Karunanidhi dare to do <br />this with other religions? Will he dare to say that in TN only thai 1 <br />should be observed as new year and hence there should be no prayers in <br />the church on 1st Jan? <br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Bharathi is a genius.. again a poor soul who was neglected by the <br />govts. for the simple reason that he was a brahmin by birth. Again for <br />people who say Bharathi has been respected by all and has been given <br />the due respect, I beg to differ, no Dravida katchi quotes him and they <br />quote only Bharathidasan, no govt. officials garland him on his birth <br />or death anniversay.<br /><br />I used to wonder, If he had sung so broken hearted in those days, what <br />would have he sung if he is alive today? Probably he would have took up <br />arms? He was a revolutionist in his own sense for his period.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Humble Groups" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>http://youtube.com/watch?v=T3gHFvTjp_g</div></blockquote></div>
