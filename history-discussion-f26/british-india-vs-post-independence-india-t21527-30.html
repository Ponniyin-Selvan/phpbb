			<div class="content">Dear Ravi<br />I am afraid your arguement is hollow<br /><br />Tamilnadu is just one example...you just have to turn into history books to see the sects and sections good example rajputs...marathas...<br /><br />Who said people didnt fight against them<br />History books again Kalingas resisted Ashoka...Bloody War<br />Pulikesin resisted Harshavardana<br />Sivaji fought Aurangazeb.....<br /><br />The only difference between Then and the British for 300 years the Indians were enslaved the free ones that is under the british and joined a man who cared for them....<br />the Maharajas were still bystnaders negotiating their future with the brits...OOOps the enemies<br /><br />Regards<br />Sri<br /><br /><br />ravi venu  wrote: <br /><img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Agreed to that point.<br />And it is true that I will never accept the supremacy of the crown.<br /><br />Pakistan vs India is something of a different ghost and again points to british (may be i can give them credit for a useful side effect).<br /><br />What was india called before ... this is funny, it just shows that your argument is very very limited to tamil nadu, i dont blame it but then thats what the english achieved. There was a country called 'BHARAT' or as we say ' Bharatam'. Does the name Bharatham make any sense ?<br /><br />Read thirupugazh (1400 AD) and you will know how much of sanskrit and other bharat languages are mixed in that... mixing up dark ages with the light of a train coming out of a dark tunnel is not in the best interests of bharat.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: R.venketesh <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2007 3:16:21 AM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence India<br /><br /><br />Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and<br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.<br /><br />but just tell me<br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850,<br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such<br />entity.<br /><br />today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we<br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi<br />driver in ajman UAE.<br /><br />borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic<br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir,<br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting<br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese<br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case<br />against them.<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, ravi venu  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venkatesh<br /> <br />  Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best.<br />You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a</div></blockquote>bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages. Well, ask the<br />remaining of community to see who can beat spielberg in recreating<br />history.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Paying taxes or attending to schools were a force of rule.

What made these dumb guys so patriotic that they could not<br />tolerate the british but could tolerate every other ruler even as<br />horrible as aurangazeb ?<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Oh I forgot, we were split into so many zamindars and duh how the<br />heck did they all unite under a half naked man ?<br /> <br />  Every country has its dark age, every economy has its fall, every<br />kingdom has to crash, every corporate has to buckle sometime, law of</div></blockquote>nature.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>5th century to 1000 AD was british dark age, India started from<br />1100 to 1700 - not as a dark age but as unstable period. 1300 - 1600</div></blockquote>was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances (many people<br />opposing the mugal autocratic rule) during that time when the country<br />was 'rediscovering' itself, which people like you conveniently call<br />as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled<br />for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250.<br />Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many<br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the<br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of<br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was<br />spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil<br />heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals<br />tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah</div></blockquote>ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of<br />their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were<br />they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was<br />educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people<br />such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst<br />you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going<br />the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>India, an internal economy, there in was her strength, the british<br />wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on</div></blockquote>Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the<br />industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the<br />Imperial Gazzetter of 1881: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>some experts<br />  1903-04 Data is Lakh Rupees &#40;Rupees of that Era&#41;<br />  Items Imports Exports &#40;Textile&#41;<br />  Apparels 172 16<br />  Raw Cotton 5 2438<br />  Cotton Goods 31288 10<br />  Wool Items 215 27<br />  My country paid &#40;imported&#41; Rs 31,680 lakhs and sold &#40;exported&#41;<br />Rs.2500 lakh... rocket science on the numbers. This is only in</div></blockquote>textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see that<br />a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for 100<br />years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with<br />their rule.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Gandhi systematically counteracted them by dismantling their<br />managerial capacities, hitting them where it mattered the most, Tata</div></blockquote>built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for Tata,<br />they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and<br />Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from<br />India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and<br />that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead.<br />  You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our<br />money.<br />  And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still<br />available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan of</div></blockquote>chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british<br />rule to MLA's of republic of India. We are still at war with our<br />neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will<br />always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise<br />today or tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont<br />release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool!<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>This is a great country, no matter how many people work hard on<br />demotivating us or plundering us, we will prove our mettle.

Frustration on post independence<br />India<br />  is not to be diverted as &#39;oh the british were better&#39;, that is<br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.<br />   <br />    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability,<br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly<br />  set afire by the British.<br />   <br />    Sati: <br />    1. A certain &#39;indian&#39; by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core<br />of<br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. &#40;British never<br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have<br />  added more points below.&#41;<br />    2.Talk about a widow&#39;s life without her husband was not easy at<br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage.<br />honestly<br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life<br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />  1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of<br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />  hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />  with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It ties<br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />  where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />   <br />    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />open.<br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new<br />  definition as caste politics now.<br />   <br />    Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />kaamanai<br />  vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39;<br />was<br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />dating<br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />is<br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our<br />great<br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />were<br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />dated<br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; to<br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life.<br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or the<br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />  &#39;talent&#39;.<br />   <br />    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious<br />comment<br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />serious<br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />in<br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country.<br />   <br />    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />  by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy<br />  trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />management<br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />british<br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty British<br />-<br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />india<br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />  Kalki&#39;s<br />    comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />Britain<br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />were<br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />worthless<br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />  does<br />    not exist without the west.<br />   <br />    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain<br />is<br />  Europe&#39;s crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation<br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is<br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them<br />making<br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather<br />than<br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.<br />   <br />    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more<br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor<br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.<br />   <br />   <br />    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real<br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.<br />   <br />    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british<br />able<br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were<br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have<br />an<br />  idea now.<br />   <br />    -- Ravi<br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: viru <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 8:21:21 AM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence<br />  India<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Dear Venkateswaran,<br />   <br />    I would definitely be against all your points. What you<br />described,<br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />  characteristics of india.<br />   <br />    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />  of ourself.<br />   <br />    Ok. let me counter your points.<br />   <br />    1&#41; The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />you<br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />a<br />  women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in the following link&#41;<br />   <br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />   <br />    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />dress<br />  style is entirely different..<br />   <br />    3. Untouchability: <br />   <br />    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste&#39;s family.<br />   <br />    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />india,<br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />   <br />    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br />   <br />    4. Education & Employment: <br />   <br />    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />  ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />in<br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />  today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />  all over madras presidency.<br />   <br />    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.<br />   <br />     tree.zip <br />   <br />    5&#41; Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />  western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th<br />  century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />   <br />    6. Devadasi: <br />   <br />    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />   <br />    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />  sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />the<br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />effect.&#41;<br />   <br />    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />bharatanatyam,<br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded<br />to<br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />   <br />   <br />    7. Slavery: <br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br />   <br />    8. Child Marriage: <br />   <br />    Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />  girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The<br />  girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her<br />  childhood and get adapted to it.<br />   <br />    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />  days.<br />   <br />    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in<br />the<br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />   <br />    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />  it is considered as evil.<br />   <br />    9. Priestly Class<br />   <br />    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />and<br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />with<br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />  vellalars.<br />   <br />    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />   <br />    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed<br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br />   <br />    10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />   <br />    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />  mother tongues..<br />   <br />    11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />   <br />    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its<br />sacrificed<br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br />   <br />    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />  community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is barbarious,<br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />   <br />    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />   <br />    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />that,<br />  let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />   <br />   <br />    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />   <br />    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br />  is barbaric.<br />   <br />    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />our<br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />  still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K<br />   wrote: <br />     <br />      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations: <br />     <br />      1&#41; The Sati system<br />      2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3&#41; Untouchability & bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4&#41; Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5&#41; Fate of widows<br />      6&#41; Marriage of girls to gods &#40; pottu kattutal &#41; & the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7&#41; Slavery<br />      8&#41; Marriage at childhood<br />      9&#41; Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10&#41; Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />     <br />      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed.<br />     <br />      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!

They assumed they were monarch and we were blinded by that over time. Our shanmadhams are common across the country from afganistan to srilanka there are temples, I consider temples that were atleast 3000 years old to start with, how did the people so far and across pray the same god as the people down south ?

I dont remember language being a barrier when Vatapi was conquered and when gangai konda cholapuram was built or saraboji ruled south.... the british could not understand what the heck we speak or how the hell we communicated... hence the rift was build. Please read Feb 19th 1835 UK parliment address of Lord Maculay.

Arunagiri was a womanizer prior to writing thirupugazh, valmiki was a thief prior to writing ramayana... so what ? It is not the question of what we did, but how soon we realize and what happened after that. Like I said, there are sensible people across the globe. There are honest god and peace abiding citizens everywhere, they see the difference between how or what is happening, the public opinion is bound to go towards the supressed and justice. The concept of public jury in the US lives and is a great way of providing justice.<br />India has a lot to offer the world, it will and it does.

I would not even be surprised if Mountbatten funded the tennis courts and academies they built. Again, we accept anything we get. What Gandhi did in his personal life is of no consequence to us and it would be vulgar to think follow collins into &#39;gandhi and his &#39;girls&#39; &#39; concepts.</div></blockquote>Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the nobels had the right of PrimaNocte.. .spending the first night with all their subjects was their right.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>may be lapierre and collins tried to justify longshank type protocal to justify scottish policy ?</div></blockquote>Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians who were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all those ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>right... thats the breed that let traders rule...thats the breed that let muguls dominate...may be thats the breed, if i were to believe collins and co, involved in deflowering... a segment of our own people who believe in destroying the country.</div></blockquote>Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because they were victorious but they kept their word.<br />-- this is a funny argument, ever seen pictures of england after the nazis gave them a run down ? right, they were like afganistant two years from now <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> and Gandhi was a thorn in their flesh - do they have a choice ? India became more of a problem than as a party at that time. Never fight two wars at the same time, simple policy. British had no choice. They needed India however had no other choice. Infact Mr.Churchil thought it was stupid to release us... he wanted to 'milk' us and rebuild England....<br /><br />The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two old fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a country already tiorn by a partition... It was the Pakistani Chief of Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.<br />--- yeah right, the british had nothing to do with the partition or its after math.<br /><br />The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in caves...<br />We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of our own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to blam not them.<br />-- True, but it is still slipping as we still keep thinking west as the savior. Unless we recognize the fact that our country and culture teaches us the true human values, we will not progress much anyway.</div>

Frustration on post independence<br />India<br />  is not to be diverted as &#39;oh the british were better&#39;, that is<br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.<br />   <br />    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability,<br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly<br />  set afire by the British.<br />   <br />    Sati: <br />    1. A certain &#39;indian&#39; by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core<br />of<br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. &#40;British never<br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have<br />  added more points below.&#41;<br />    2.Talk about a widow&#39;s life without her husband was not easy at<br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage.<br />honestly<br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life<br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />  1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of<br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />  hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />  with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It ties<br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />  where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />   <br />    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />open.<br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new<br />  definition as caste politics now.<br />   <br />    Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />kaamanai<br />  vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39;<br />was<br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />dating<br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />is<br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our<br />great<br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />were<br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />dated<br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; to<br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life.<br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or the<br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />  &#39;talent&#39;.<br />   <br />    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious<br />comment<br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />serious<br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />in<br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country.<br />   <br />    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />  by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy<br />  trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />management<br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />british<br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty British<br />-<br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />india<br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />  Kalki&#39;s<br />    comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />Britain<br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />were<br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />worthless<br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />  does<br />    not exist without the west.<br />   <br />    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain<br />is<br />  Europe&#39;s crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation<br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is<br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them<br />making<br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather<br />than<br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.<br />   <br />    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more<br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor<br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.<br />   <br />   <br />    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real<br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.<br />   <br />    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british<br />able<br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were<br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have<br />an<br />  idea now.<br />   <br />    -- Ravi<br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: viru <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 8:21:21 AM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence<br />  India<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Dear Venkateswaran,<br />   <br />    I would definitely be against all your points. What you<br />described,<br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />  characteristics of india.<br />   <br />    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />  of ourself.<br />   <br />    Ok. let me counter your points.<br />   <br />    1&#41; The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />you<br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />a<br />  women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in the following link&#41;<br />   <br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />   <br />    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />dress<br />  style is entirely different..<br />   <br />    3. Untouchability: <br />   <br />    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste&#39;s family.<br />   <br />    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />india,<br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />   <br />    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br />   <br />    4. Education & Employment: <br />   <br />    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />  ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />in<br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />  today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />  all over madras presidency.<br />   <br />    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.<br />   <br />     tree.zip <br />   <br />    5&#41; Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />  western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th<br />  century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />   <br />    6. Devadasi: <br />   <br />    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />   <br />    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />  sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />the<br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />effect.&#41;<br />   <br />    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />bharatanatyam,<br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded<br />to<br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />   <br />   <br />    7. Slavery: <br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br />   <br />    8. Child Marriage: <br />   <br />    Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />  girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The<br />  girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her<br />  childhood and get adapted to it.<br />   <br />    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />  days.<br />   <br />    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in<br />the<br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />   <br />    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />  it is considered as evil.<br />   <br />    9. Priestly Class<br />   <br />    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />and<br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />with<br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />  vellalars.<br />   <br />    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />   <br />    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed<br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br />   <br />    10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />   <br />    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />  mother tongues..<br />   <br />    11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />   <br />    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its<br />sacrificed<br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br />   <br />    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />  community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is barbarious,<br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />   <br />    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />   <br />    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />that,<br />  let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />   <br />   <br />    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />   <br />    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br />  is barbaric.<br />   <br />    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />our<br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />  still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K<br />   wrote: <br />     <br />      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers.

Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed.<br />     <br />      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!

What happens in a widows life<br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />  1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of<br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />  hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />  with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It ties<br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />  where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />   <br />    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />open.<br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new<br />  definition as caste politics now.<br />   <br />    Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />kaamanai<br />  vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39;<br />was<br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />dating<br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />is<br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our<br />great<br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />were<br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />dated<br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; to<br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life.<br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or the<br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />  &#39;talent&#39;.<br />   <br />    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious<br />comment<br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />serious<br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />in<br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country.<br />   <br />    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />  by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy<br />  trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />management<br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />british<br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty British<br />-<br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />india<br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />  Kalki&#39;s<br />    comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />Britain<br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />were<br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />worthless<br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />  does<br />    not exist without the west.<br />   <br />    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain<br />is<br />  Europe&#39;s crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation<br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is<br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them<br />making<br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather<br />than<br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.<br />   <br />    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more<br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor<br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.<br />   <br />   <br />    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real<br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.<br />   <br />    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british<br />able<br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were<br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have<br />an<br />  idea now.<br />   <br />    -- Ravi<br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: viru <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 8:21:21 AM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence<br />  India<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Dear Venkateswaran,<br />   <br />    I would definitely be against all your points. What you<br />described,<br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />  characteristics of india.<br />   <br />    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />  of ourself.<br />   <br />    Ok. let me counter your points.<br />   <br />    1&#41; The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />you<br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />a<br />  women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in the following link&#41;<br />   <br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />   <br />    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />dress<br />  style is entirely different..<br />   <br />    3. Untouchability: <br />   <br />    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste&#39;s family.<br />   <br />    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />india,<br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />   <br />    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br />   <br />    4. Education & Employment: <br />   <br />    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />  ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />in<br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />  today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />  all over madras presidency.<br />   <br />    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.<br />   <br />     tree.zip <br />   <br />    5&#41; Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />  western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th<br />  century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />   <br />    6. Devadasi: <br />   <br />    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />   <br />    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />  sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />the<br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />effect.&#41;<br />   <br />    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />bharatanatyam,<br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded<br />to<br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />   <br />   <br />    7. Slavery: <br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br />   <br />    8. Child Marriage: <br />   <br />    Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />  girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The<br />  girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her<br />  childhood and get adapted to it.<br />   <br />    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />  days.<br />   <br />    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in<br />the<br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />   <br />    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />  it is considered as evil.<br />   <br />    9. Priestly Class<br />   <br />    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />and<br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />with<br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />  vellalars.<br />   <br />    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />   <br />    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed<br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br />   <br />    10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />   <br />    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />  mother tongues..<br />   <br />    11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />   <br />    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its<br />sacrificed<br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br />   <br />    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />  community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is barbarious,<br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />   <br />    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />   <br />    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />that,<br />  let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />   <br />   <br />    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />   <br />    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br />  is barbaric.<br />   <br />    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />our<br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />  still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K<br />   wrote: <br />     <br />      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers.

Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed.<br />     <br />      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!

Frustration on post independence<br />India<br />  is not to be diverted as &#39;oh the british were better&#39;, that is<br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.<br />   <br />    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability,<br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly<br />  set afire by the British.<br />   <br />    Sati: <br />    1. A certain &#39;indian&#39; by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core<br />of<br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. &#40;British never<br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management<br />strategy, i have<br />  added more points below.&#41;<br />    2.Talk about a widow&#39;s life without her husband was not easy at<br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage.<br />honestly<br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life<br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />  1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out<br />of<br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />  hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />  with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It ties<br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />  where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />   <br />    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />open.<br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />  1000 years now. It is not<br />called untouchability now, it has a new<br />  definition as caste politics now.<br />   <br />    Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />kaamanai<br />  vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39;<br />was<br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />dating<br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />is<br />  taboo. We know what many<br />teens of our era are doing vs what our</div></blockquote>great<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />were<br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />dated<br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; to<br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life.<br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or the<br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />  &#39;talent&#39;.<br />   <br />    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />  African way. I<br />would first need to know if that is a serious</div></blockquote>comment<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />serious<br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />in<br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country.<br />   <br />    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />  by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy<br />  trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />management<br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of<br />the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />british<br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty British<br />-<br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />india<br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />  Kalki&#39;s<br />    comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />Britain<br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />were<br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are</div></blockquote>worthless<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />  does<br />    not exist without the west.<br />   <br />    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere.

What you<br />described,<br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />  characteristics of india.<br />   <br />    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />  of ourself.<br />   <br />    Ok. let me counter your points.<br />   <br />    1&#41; The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />you<br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />a<br />  women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in<br />the following link&#41;<br />   <br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />   <br />    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />dress<br />  style is entirely different..<br />   <br />    3. Untouchability: <br />   <br />    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC<br />caste&#39;s family.<br />   <br />    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />india,<br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />   <br />    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br />   <br />    4. Education & Employment: <br />   <br />    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />  ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />in<br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />  today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />  all over madras presidency.<br />   <br />    You can find more details in the following book of<br />dharampal.<br />   <br />     tree.zip <br />   <br />    5&#41; Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />  western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th<br />  century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />   <br />    6. Devadasi: <br />   <br />    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />   <br />    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />  sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />the<br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />effect.&#41;<br />   <br />    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />bharatanatyam,<br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are<br />degraded</div></blockquote>to<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />   <br />   <br />    7. Slavery: <br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br />   <br />    8. Child Marriage: <br />   <br />    Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />  girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The<br />  girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her<br />  childhood and get adapted to it.<br />   <br />    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />  days.<br />   <br />    "When comparing to the<br />sexual abuse of girl child happening in</div></blockquote>the<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />   <br />    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />  it is considered as evil.<br />   <br />    9. Priestly Class<br />   <br />    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />and<br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />with<br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />  vellalars.<br />   <br />    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />   <br />    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />  castes are allowed.. its not<br />like that.. the people who performed<br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br />   <br />    10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />   <br />    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />  mother tongues..<br />   <br />    11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />   <br />    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its<br />sacrificed<br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br />   <br />    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />  community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is barbarious,<br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />   <br />   <br />Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />   <br />    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />that,<br />  let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />   <br />   <br />    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />   <br />    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br /><br />  is barbaric.<br />   <br />    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />our<br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />  still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K<br />   wrote: <br />     <br />      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers.

Thats the<br />      main crux to<br />be focussed.<br />     <br />      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi<br />I always felt history books should be read like physics or chemistry <br />books. then you dont get emotional about boyle's law.<br /><br />the resistance against mughals, men riding out to the last battle and <br />the women commiting jauhar is still acknowledged in the west and <br />north parts of india. to them its more emotional than the struggle <br />against the british.<br /><br />the war against the mughals by the sikhs, rajputs, and the marattas <br />was eternal. it was an on going process for 300 years.<br />the shiv sena is based on those ideals.<br />the hindu muslim issues including babri masjid are ofshoots of those.<br /><br />people blame the british for the india pakistan divide. but just <br />imagine with a 17 percent population we have so much friction. what <br />if they had occupied 45 percent in an udivided india.<br /><br />venketesh</div>

Well, ask the <br />  remaining of community to see who can beat spielberg in recreating <br />  history.<br />    <br />    Paying taxes or attending to schools were a force of rule. Looks <br />  like people such as your self would always prefer to be a slave to <br />  white skin and sing their lullaby anytime. <br />    <br />    Give me a single reason: <br />    Why would the so called tribal indians, who are barbaric and had <br />  been binded to so many social evils and did not speak &#39;one&#39; <br />language <br />  &#39;unite&#39; against a massive british &#39;Godly&#39; rule and take them down <br />in <br />  the path that has NEVER ever before been done in the history of the <br />  world. What made these dumb guys so patriotic that they could not <br />  tolerate the british but could<br />  tolerate every other ruler even as <br />  horrible as aurangazeb ? <br />    <br />    Oh I forgot, we were split into so many zamindars and duh how the <br />  heck did they all unite under a half naked man ? <br />    <br />    Every country has its dark age, every economy has its fall, every <br />  kingdom has to crash, every corporate has to buckle sometime, law <br />of <br />  nature. <br />    5th century to 1000 AD was british dark age, India started from <br />  1100 to 1700 - not as a dark age but as unstable period. 1300 - <br />1600 <br />  was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances &#40;many people <br />  opposing the mugal autocratic rule&#41; during that time when the <br />country <br />  was &#39;rediscovering&#39; itself, which people like you conveniently call <br />  as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals <br />ruled <br />  for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />  Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />  states, so what ? US is 50+ states,<br />  china was so many states the <br />  biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />  the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was <br />  spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil <br />  heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country. <br />    <br />    Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals <br />  tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah <br />  ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of <br />  their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were <br />  they can spread their culture, education &#40;as if no one else was <br />  educated&#41;, systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people <br />  such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. <br />Whilst <br />  you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us <br />going <br />  the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.<br />    <br />    India, an internal<br />  economy, there in was her strength, the british <br />  wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on <br />  Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the <br />  industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the <br />  Imperial Gazzetter of 1881: <br />    some experts<br />    1903-04 Data is Lakh Rupees &#40;Rupees of that Era&#41;<br />    Items Imports Exports &#40;Textile&#41;<br />    Apparels 172 16<br />    Raw Cotton 5 2438<br />    Cotton Goods 31288 10<br />    Wool Items 215 27<br />    My country paid &#40;imported&#41; Rs 31,680 lakhs and sold &#40;exported&#41; <br />  Rs.2500 lakh... rocket science on the numbers. This is only in <br />  textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see <br />that <br />  a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for <br />100 <br />  years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with <br />  their rule.<br />    <br />    Gandhi systematically counteracted them by dismantling their <br />  managerial capacities,<br />  hitting them where it mattered the most, Tata <br />  built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for <br />Tata, <br />  they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and <br />  Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from <br />  India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield. <br />    Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and <br />  that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead. <br />    You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our <br />  money. <br />    And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still <br />  available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan <br />of <br />  chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british <br />  rule to MLA&#39;s of republic of India. We are still at war with our <br />  neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will <br />  always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise <br />  today or<br />  tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont <br />  release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool! <br />    <br />    This is a great country, no matter how many people work hard on <br />  demotivating us or plundering us, we will prove our mettle. One <br />thing <br />  is for sure, it is immaterial if Maculay really said his famous <br />quote <br />  in 1835, what is alleged definitely is happening today. They have <br />  successfully planted their domain in minds of many indians. It is <br />  another test for the great nation and I am sure she will come good <br />as  <br />  usual.<br />    <br />    -- Ravi<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: R.venketesh <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 11:17:15 PM<br />    Subject: <br />  [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence <br />  India<br />    <br />    Hi Venu<br />    I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />    thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid <br />their <br />    taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.<br />    <br />    most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs <br />who <br />    saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />  war. <br />    the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />    what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />    nation called india in say 1600.<br />    if you were born in 1600 &#40; or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />  not <br />    come at all&#41; you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />    pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />  ramnad <br />    or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />   <br />  madurai.<br />    that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />    you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />  show <br />    of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />  opened <br />    negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />    hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of <br />tranvancore, <br />    the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />    this would have united south india.<br />    then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />  hindu <br />    muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings&#40; ar you will <br />be <br />    calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon&#41; <br />to <br />    unite one democratic nation called india.<br />    you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />    even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />  sardar <br />    to join the indian confedration.<br />    the<br />  maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />    you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and <br />pelf <br />  so <br />    that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />    its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.<br />    <br />    have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things <br />exisited <br />    in this part of the world along with the social evils we have <br />been <br />    discussing.<br />    <br />    to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />    trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.<br />    <br />    patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />  not <br />    be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"<br />    <br />    what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />  the <br />    slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />  united <br />    india.<br />    regards<br />    venketesh<br />    <br />   <br />    <br />      Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a <br />barbaric <br />    tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in <br />a <br />    shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />  pathetic <br />    and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />    people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />  India <br />    is not to be diverted as &#39;oh the british were better&#39;, that is <br />    childish and namesake pathetic argument.<br />      <br />      Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, <br />untouchability, <br />    child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and <br />clearly <br />    set afire by the British. <br />      <br />      Sati: <br />      1. A certain &#39;indian&#39; by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />  of <br />    issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. &#40;British <br />never <br />    allow any controversy to brew,excellent management<br />  strategy, i have <br />    added more points below.&#41;<br />      2.Talk about a widow&#39;s life without her husband was not easy at <br />    that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />  honestly <br />    how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows <br />life <br />    is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />    treatment she gets even today.<br />      We had been a warring community according to some,by logic,  <br />where <br />    there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />    there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />    during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />      The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was <br />opted <br />    by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they <br />have <br />    lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />    1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out<br />  of <br />    compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />    hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to <br />do <br />    with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />      Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It <br />ties <br />    up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like <br />now <br />    where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />      <br />      Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />    concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />    middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />  open. <br />    Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />    etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />    book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />    untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />    1000 years now. It is not<br />  called untouchability now, it has a new <br />    definition as caste politics now.<br />      <br />      Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />  kaamanai <br />    vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, <br />during <br />    the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model <br />of <br />    Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />    their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; <br />  was <br />    to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />    reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to <br />think <br />    what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />  dating <br />    was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />    reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western <br />model <br />    and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where <br />sex <br />  is <br />    taboo. We know what many<br />  teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />  great <br />    grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />  were <br />    children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. <br />Compare <br />    the success of child<br />      mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />  dated <br />    concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; <br />to <br />    follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an <br />answer <br />    our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, <br />where <br />    girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life. <br />    Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />    internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or <br />the <br />    energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />    &#39;talent&#39;. <br />      <br />      A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />    African way. I<br />  would first need to know if that is a serious <br />  comment <br />    or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />    understand the basics of India can really try very hard and <br />compare <br />    India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />  serious <br />    literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />  in <br />    Africa is more or less degrading my country. <br />      <br />      A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really <br />did, <br />    by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy <br />    trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />      There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />  management <br />    people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />      people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard <br />like <br />    dyre or jackson the<br />      british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />      supporters of<br />  the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />    even<br />      caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />  british <br />    to rethink a motive. That<br />      is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty <br />British <br />  - <br />    I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - <br />english<br />      patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />  india <br />    was<br />      definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />    Kalki&#39;s<br />      comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />  Britain <br />    is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />  were <br />    the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />   <br />  worthless <br />    and sing<br />      hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the <br />India <br />    does<br />      not exist without the west. <br />      <br />      Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here <br />is<br />      equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />  is <br />    Europe&#39;s crime<br />      hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />    recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It <br />is <br />    like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />  making <br />    mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />  than <br />    adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.<br />      <br />      A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />  worry.<br />      What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />  citizens<br />      who helped the british then, only that we are<br />  all indians.<br />      <br />      <br />      I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the <br />real <br />    Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.<br />      <br />      On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />  able <br />    to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />    Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />  an <br />    idea now. <br />      <br />      -- Ravi<br />      ----- Original Message ----<br />      From: viru <br />      To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />      Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 8:21:21 AM<br />      Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post <br />Independence <br />    India<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />   <br />    <br />      Dear Venkateswaran,<br />      <br />      I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />  described, <br />    may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />    characteristics of india.<br />      <br />      I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in <br />capturing <br />    our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak <br />ill <br />    of ourself.<br />      <br />      Ok. let me counter your points.<br />      <br />      1&#41; The Sati system<br />      The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />    Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />  women.<br />      Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />    areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />  you <br />    to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke <br />to <br />  a <br />    women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in<br />  the following link&#41;<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />      <br />      I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />    this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. <br />We <br />    should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />  dress <br />    style is entirely different..<br />      <br />      3. Untouchability: <br />      <br />      This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />    Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />    caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, <br />the <br />    SC castes do not drink water in other SC<br />  caste&#39;s family.<br />      <br />      Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than <br />those <br />    semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />  india, <br />    the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />    semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />      <br />      The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british <br />creation. <br />      <br />      4. Education & Employment: <br />      <br />      Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />    ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />  in <br />    Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />    today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />      The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />    all over madras presidency.<br />      <br />      You can find more details in the following book of<br />  dharampal.<br />      <br />       3beautiful- <br />    tree.zip <br />      <br />      5&#41; Fate of widows<br />      You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />    they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />    western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th <br />    century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />      <br />      6. Devadasi: <br />      <br />      Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />    were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />    devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />      <br />      The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with <br />the <br />    highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />    sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />    devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />    choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />  the <br />    concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />  effect.&#41;<br />      <br />      See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />  bharatanatyam, <br />    were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, <br />like <br />    lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />      Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />    prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />    cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are<br />  degraded <br />  to <br />    prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />    rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />      <br />      <br />      7. Slavery: <br />      Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point <br />of <br />    time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim <br />invaders.<br />      <br />      8. Child Marriage: <br />      <br />      Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />    usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />    relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that <br />the <br />    girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The <br />    girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her <br />    childhood and get adapted to it.<br />      <br />      Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />    days.<br />      <br />      "When comparing to the<br />  sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />  the <br />    west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />      <br />      If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on <br />why <br />    it is considered as evil.<br />      <br />      9. Priestly Class<br />      <br />      Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />  and <br />    spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />    profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />  with <br />    brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />    vellalars.<br />      <br />      also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to <br />be <br />    priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />    untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />      <br />      So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />    castes are allowed.. its not<br />  like that.. the people who performed <br />    priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our <br />country.<br />      <br />      10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />      <br />      This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all <br />our <br />    mother tongues..<br />      <br />      11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />      <br />      Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that <br />the <br />    animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its <br />  sacrificed <br />    in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. <br />      <br />      Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />    slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />      Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />    community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is <br />barbarious, <br />    and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />      <br />     <br />  Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />      <br />      Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />  that, <br />    let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />      <br />      <br />      we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />      <br />      I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />    committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />    Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />    committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />      <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which <br />one<br />   <br />    is barbaric. <br />      <br />      No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its <br />really <br />    a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form  <br />of <br />  our <br />    culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we <br />going <br />    to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />    paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />    still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />      <br />      Regards,<br />      Senthil Raja<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K <br />     wrote: <br />       <br />        The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />        about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />        really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />        those modern thinking, some of the elements of<br />  our<br />        society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />        today, when compared with contemporary nations: <br />        <br />        1&#41; The Sati system<br />        2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />        garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />        3&#41; Untouchability & bad treatment of lower caste.<br />        4&#41; Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />        5&#41; Fate of widows<br />        6&#41; Marriage of girls to gods &#40; pottu kattutal &#41; & the<br />        devadasi system<br />        7&#41; Slavery<br />        8&#41; Marriage at childhood<br />        9&#41; Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />        10&#41; Suppression of mother tongues.<br />        11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />        <br />        But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />        main crux to<br />  be focussed. <br />        <br />        The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />        children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />        pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />        truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />        enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />        should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />        illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />        they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!<br />        <br />       <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />     <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />    <br />  For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!
