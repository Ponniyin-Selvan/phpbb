			<div class="content">Dear Venkatesans,<br /><br />As directed by Moderator R Venkatesan, I wind up discussion on this <br />subject.<br /><br />The undermentioned post was prior to reading his directive.. <br /><br />S U B H A M ...<br /><br />sps<br /><br /><br />=========================================================     <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>SPS Sir,<br />      Please note the word "siRu deivam" referring to Govindarajar. <br />  The <br />      same Govindarajar was glorified by the Azhwar as DevAdhi <br />Devan. <br />  ================<br />  <br />  Dear V. Venkatesh,<br />  <br />  Please answer this simple question :: <br />  <br />  In which Ancient Literature it is mentioned that the presiding <br />deity <br />  is named as GOVINDARAJAR in Chitrakudam - Chidambaram. <br />  <br />  To find more details, I just skimmed through 108 Divya Desangal by <br />  Karaikkudi based Vishnava Siddhantha Noorpadhipu kazhagam - <br />Ethijan.<br />  <br />  <br />  He quotes : <br />  <br />  Siru + Ambalam = Chithambaram !<br />  <br />  Whereas most of us know that " THE KOIL " is Srirangam for <br />  Vaishnavites and CHIDAMBARAM for Saivaites...<br />  <br />  Chith &#40;Chitham - Determination in Mind &#41; which itself a Temple is <br />  the root word.<br />  <br />  Pls read quotes on CONCEPT OF SIVA &#40;By Dr. Nagaswamy&#41; posted by me <br />a <br />  year back in the Archieves.<br />  <br />  Also pls read Jagasirpiyan fiction.  <br />  <br />  The Chidambaram temple is a CONCEPT temple : <br />  <br />  With number of bones,<br />  number of breathes &#40;nails &#41; ,<br />  number of veins &#40;cross beams &#41;etc.,<br />  <br />  Karbagraham like heart<br />  with an inlet / outlet etc...<br />  depicting human body ..<br />  in which Moolasthanam &#40;Moolattanar - Appar hymned in 7th AD&#41; is <br />Chit-<br />  Ambalam - which LINGAM is supposedly erected on the JEEVA SAMADHI <br />of <br />  Thirumoolar - who is reportedly hymned 1 Stanza one year for 3000 <br />  years - which later became to be known as Thirumandhiram ! Which <br />is <br />  Devine Manthra for the Tamil World.<br />  <br />  In that Hall Adhiseshan is reportedly gave details on Mahabashyam <br />  behind a curtain and a lonely student &#40;with others cutting the <br />  class&#41; when opened the curtain got perished ..<br />  <br />  Pls read my quote on " AJABA " in the Archieves..<br />  <br />  Jaba .. repeatedly chanting / adopting with effort.<br />  <br />  A+Jaba : Spontaneous :: without effort<br />  <br />  Over the heart of Sriman Narayan Nataraja is positioned .. and HIS <br />  MOVEMENTS - SPONTANEOUS AND EFFORTLESS SYNCRONISING WITH SRIMAN <br />  NARAYAN&#39;S BREATHE - IS A DANCE KNOWN AS " AJABA" . When you come <br />  out of Thiruvarur Temple Sanctum &#40;East facing, So southern exit&#41;, <br />on <br />  the South facing wall - you will find the pictorial depiction of <br />  this.<br />  <br />  Our respected member Kathie has rightly put - Saivism and <br />  Vaishanavism are intertwined in weaving the lovely Hindusim fabric.<br />  <br />  When a Scholar of Dr. Nagaswamy&#39;s stature is referring <br />Ottakothar&#39;s <br />  statement as NIRMALYAM, we have to bring this into open.<br />  <br />  When another Scholar SR Balasubramanian observes after discussing <br />in <br />  detail that Kulothunga I & St Ramanujar&#39;s rift was without <br />evidence <br />  that also has to be brought out ..  <br />  <br />  <br />  If we think a Sculpture of present Govindaraja&#39;s magnitude is <br />  identified as " Siru Deivam " by Ottakoothar then he has erred..<br />  <br />  But if Krishnas with almost 10 leelas, Ulagalandan, sitting vishnu <br />+ <br />  2 Devis, standing Rama &#40;Sri Rama was never alone without Sita + <br />  Lakshman + Hanuman atleast&#41; with " ARAVANAIYIL KIDANTHAN " as <br />could <br />  be seen from 7th Century hymns, I leave it you to name this entity <br />  whether could have been as bigger as of present Sculpture..<br />  <br />  And in the entire Discussion the CURCIAL WORD CHITRA &#40;picture&#41; IS <br />  NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION !<br />  <br />  We are all talking of Sculptures !!!<br />  <br />  I earlier concluded that Kulothunga II in his 18 years span has <br />  contributed only to 5 temples including chidambaram + Srirangam. <br />  <br />  Please read on Kulothunga II.<br />  <br />  His officials behaved with &#40;Independent&#41; Authority..<br />  <br />  And Poet would have been more loyal than the King in certain <br />issues..<br />  <br />  anbudan / sps<br />  -----------------<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  So <br />      the fact that Ottakoothar has reflected the thoughts of <br />  Kulothunga <br />    II <br />      that he considered the Vishnu as "siRu dheivam" speaks of his <br />    lesser <br />      reverence for anyone other than Siva. <br />      <br />    <br />    <br />    Hi venkatesh<br />    <br />    Can you see the Urdhava thandavam sculpture of perur in the <br />above <br />    link<br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/05/27/stories/2005052700390300.htm">http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/05/27/stor ... 390300.htm</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    this sculpture is true to rendition of the dance form...&#40; had <br />  posted <br />    an extract of the book on Nataraja by C. Sivaramoorthi <br />earlier.... <br />    quoting the same at the end of the post&#41;<br />    <br />    Now brahma is shown with the chai chak sorry jalra &#40; opps sorry -<br /> <br />    ithukku per ennappa &#41;....and vishnu is playing the drum. Now you <br />    cannot fault the sculpture /artist....for he is following the <br />    dicition &#40; watch the size of paravati in the entire <br />composition&#41; - <br />    interesting to note the the dwarf muhilagan&#39;s size in comparison <br />  to <br />    vishnu, brahma and parvathi...<br />    <br />    now coming back to ottakutthar verse - in the context of this  <br />    sculptural composition mal siru deivam thane....<br />    <br />    rgds<br />    vj<br />    <br />    As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, <br />in <br />    the<br />    loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the <br />  goddess <br />    of<br />    prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />    nritta<br />    aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, <br />with<br />    the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon <br />emerging <br />    into<br />    light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />    prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord&#39;s <br />    musical<br />    orchestra: <br />    astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />    cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />    samalakshyata nakalakshmih &#40;Haravijya 19.5&#41;.<br />    <br />    This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />    music,<br />    Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping <br />  time<br />    and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is <br />an<br />    adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, <br />  there <br />    is<br />    an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />    Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and <br />Nali: <br />    vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi <br />tali<br />    nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />    &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11&#41; tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />  hyaninditah<br />    &#40;Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21&#41; naikatanaratas svarah <br />  &#40;Lingamahapurana <br />    1,<br />    65, 40&#41;. The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />  provided<br />    with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina.

At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, <br />  with<br />      the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon <br />  emerging <br />      into<br />      light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />      prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord&#39;s <br />      musical<br />      orchestra: <br />      astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />      cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />      samalakshyata nakalakshmih &#40;Haravijya 19.5&#41;.<br />      <br />      This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady <br />of <br />      music,<br />      Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma <br />keeping <br />    time<br />      and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself <br />is <br />  an<br />      adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, <br />    there <br />      is<br />      an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described <br />as<br />      Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and <br />  Nali: <br />      vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi <br />  tali<br />      nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha <br />sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />      &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11&#41; tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />    hyaninditah<br />      &#40;Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21&#41; naikatanaratas svarah <br />    &#40;Lingamahapurana <br />      1,<br />      65, 40&#41;. The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />    provided<br />      with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva <br />delights <br />  in<br />      innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature <br />of <br />    the<br />      svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita <br />  svaras,<br />      the seven famous notes.

In the <br />Sivasahasranama, <br />      there <br />        is<br />        an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is <br />described <br />  as<br />        Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and <br />    Nali: <br />        vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha <br />panavi <br />    tali<br />        nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha <br />  sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />        &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11&#41; tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />      hyaninditah<br />        &#40;Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21&#41; naikatanaratas svarah <br />      &#40;Lingamahapurana <br />        1,<br />        65, 40&#41;. The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />      provided<br />        with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva <br />  delights <br />    in<br />        innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very <br />nature <br />  of <br />      the<br />        svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita <br />    svaras,<br />        the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: <br />akshayo<br />        rathagitas cha &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44&#41;. Ratha is <br />      Rathantarasama,<br />        by the chant of which he is invoked.

So if you are still interested, <br />I will frame it and send you personally with a copy to Vijay.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a beautiful weekend as my wife was yelling at me <br />too, and she got a huge support from my kids as well. Now I hope you <br />understand why I envy all of you!!! Ha Ha Ha.<br /><br />Thanks for including me in the family. I am learning a lot here. I <br />am reading all the previous posts one by one, but as I am late to <br />join, they are enormous.

			<div class="content">Dear SPS,<br /><br />Thanks for the encouraging words. I just read that and posted my <br />comments in Dinamalar as well. I dont know if it will be published. <br /><br />However it is really funny to note that this person jumping to <br />conclusions regarding Kamal's character in the movie. I (and we) <br />could not conclude anywhere that he is playing Ramanuja. Then where <br />is the question of faulting the history there.<br /><br />I dont know about stepping on Om and Bhagavadh Gita, but definitely <br />like one of the "self styled atheists" had asked in the comments why <br />was a case not filed for other movies, where definitely the Hindu <br />symbols of ThiruNeeru and ThirumAN were made fun off. <br /><br />Publicity????<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear V Venkatesh,<br />  <br />  Today&#39;s Dinamalar tamil daily &#40;Chennai Edn&#41; reports that <br />  Sriramanujar Dasan of a Sri Vaishnavite Forum has approached <br />Madras <br />  High Court re the movie - seeking certain modifications .!<br />  <br />  I want to record my hearty appreciations to yourself :: <br />  <br />  You have listened to other&#39;s views and responded positive.<br />  <br />  And chosen words carefully not to disrupt the harmony.<br />  <br />  Very well &#40;being&#41; done.. <br />  <br />  Looking forward for more contributions..<br />  <br />  anbudan /<br />  <br />  sps</div></blockquote></div>
