GANESAN<br /><br />This bas-relief at Kazhugumalai has three rows of Jaina Tirthankaras<br />seated on lotus pedestals.<br /><br />WE were completely unprepared for what awaited us as A. Gangadurai,<br />the caretaker, opened the locks of the single gate near a barbed wire<br />fence and led us down a flight of narrow steps hewn out of a hill at<br />Kazhugumalai.<br /><br />On the rock surface, frozen in time, was a superbly sculpted Jaina<br />Tirthankara seated in the ardhapariyankasana pose on a lion pedestal,<br />with a triple umbrella above his head. Around the enlightened one were<br />celestial maidens, dancing inside coils of creepers or playing the<br />flute or a percussion instrument. Their merry abandon signified the<br />occasion of his attaining kevalagnana, or enlightenment. On either<br />side was a chowrie (flywhisk)-bearer. Below them, two devotees stood<br />with flowers in their hands.<br /><br /><br />The sculpted panel also had two fish-headed makaras, with a warrior<br />coming forth from the mouth of each. Other warriors, on horseback,<br />were there to see the great soul attain enlightenment. On top were the<br />carvings of Surya and Chandra, and Indra on his elephant Airavatham.<br />Below this bas-relief was an inscription in Tamil vatteluttu (a<br />rounded script).<br /><br />Every image in this sculpture is rich in details. "Every figure is<br />richly carved while the Tirthankara himself looks so plain. This is a<br />sculpture of unsurpassed beauty," said V. Vedachalam, retired Senior<br />Epigraphist, Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology, whose forte is the<br />study of Jaina sites in the State. With the ease of an expert, he read<br />the vatteluttu inscriptions below the bas-reliefs.<br /><br />Kazhugumalai in Tamil means a hill inhabited by eagles. A small town<br />in Thoothukudi district in Tamil Nadu, it is about 100 kilometres from<br />Madurai and 25 km from Kovilpatti.<br /><br />The name Kazhugumalai is of relatively recent origin Â– about 200 years<br />old. The original name was Ilanelchuram, meaning area full of fertile<br />paddy fields. It was also called Araimalai or Tirumalai.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this bas-relief, Tirthankara Parsvanatha is shown with snake hoods<br />over his head. The yaksha Dharnendra is seen protecting him, and<br />Kamdan, who tried to kill him by throwing a huge piece of rock at him,<br />is seen as surrendering. Yakshi Padmavathi is also depicted in the<br />sculpture.<br /><br />The hilltop offers a breathtaking view of paddy fields interspersed<br />with palmyra trees. There are ponds on either side of the hill. A<br />church spire jabs the sky on one side and around the church is the<br />small town.<br /><br />Vedachalam explained: "Kazhugumalai was an active centre of Jaina<br />learning for 300 years from the 8th century A.D. It was a place of<br />worship, a monastery and a college. Jains from Tirucharanam and<br />Kottaru [both in present-day Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu] came<br />to Kazhugumalai to teach and learn. There were women teachers also here."<br /><br />The male teacher was called "kuravar" and the female teacher<br />"kurathi". The inscriptions here give the names of a number of kurathis.<br /><br />"Monks were also called Battarar," said T. Arun Raj, Deputy<br />Superintending Archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India (Chennai<br />Circle). "Nuns called kurathis came to Kazhugumalai from different<br />Jaina centres such as Tirunarungkondai, Tirucharanam, Tirukottaru and<br />Tirumalai [near Vellore] in the Tamil country."<br />Treasure trove<br /><br />Kazhugumalai is a treasure trove of indescribably beautiful Jaina<br />sculptures. An amazing sight confronted us as we clambered up the<br />hill. On a long rock surface were three rows of bas-reliefs of<br />Tirthankaras, all seated in pedestals made of two rows of lotus<br />flowers. Blossomed lotuses formed the upper row while inverted lotuses<br />formed the lower row.<br /><br /><br /><br />At an Ayyanar temple, hidden inside the sanctum sanctorum, are these<br />sculptures of Tirthankaras seated in ardhapariyankasana. The temple,<br />which came up about 100 years ago, obscures some of the bas-reliefs.<br /><br />R. Champakalakshmi, former Professor of History at Jawaharlal Nehru<br />University, Delhi, in her essay titled "From natural caverns to<br />rock-cut and structural temples: the changing context of Jain<br />religious tradition in Tamil Nadu", calls the three rows of<br />Tirthankaras "a unique group of the 24 of three kalas, or ages, i.e.,<br />Trikala Caturvimsati TirthankarasÂ…." The essay has been published in<br />Airavati, a felicitation volume brought out by Varalaaru.com in honour<br />of the epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan in August 2008.<br /><br />A few hundred metres from the rock surface is Vettuvan Kovil, a<br />monolithic temple hewn out of a hill. The late C. Sivaramamurti, who<br />was the Director of the National Museum in New Delhi, in his book<br />Kalugumalai and Early Pandyan Rock-cut Shrines, describes it as "by<br />far the most beautiful rock-cut temple of the Pandya periodÂ… a<br />half-finished free-standing monolith which recalls the famous temple<br />of Siva at Ellora". The Jaina sites at Kazhugumalai and Vettuvan Kovil<br />are under the State Department of Archaeology.<br /><br />Apart from Vedachalam's articles in the Kalvettu magazine published by<br />the State Department of Archaeology, Kazhugumalai finds considerable<br />mention in the work of scholars such as Champakalakshmi, A.<br />Ekambaranathan (Professor, Department of Ancient History and<br />Archaeology, University of Madras, and author of a book in Tamil on<br />Kazhugumalai) and S.M. Ganapathi (retired Curator, Tamil Nadu<br />Department of Archaeology and author of a book in Tamil titled<br />Kazhugumalai, Vettuvan Kovil).<br />Jaina settlements<br /><br />Jaina settlements came into being in the Tamil country around Madurai<br />in the 3rd century B.C. with the arrival of monks from the north.<br />Pandya kings and merchant guilds patronised these monks.<br /><br />In the 7th century A.D., with the rise of the Bhakti Movement led by<br />Saivite saints such as Tirunavukkarasar and Tirugnanasambandar,<br />Jainism suffered a setback in the region. It also lost royal patronage<br />with the Pandya king Kun Pandyan and the Pallava ruler Mahendravarman<br />embracing Saivism.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this bas-relief, celestial beings visit a Tirthankara attaining<br />enlightenment.<br /><br />However, there was a revival of Jainism in the Tamil country after the<br />8th century A.D. From a non-theistic religion, where monks lived in<br />natural caverns, it became a theistic religion, absorbing rituals on<br />the way. Several structural Jaina temples came up during this time.<br /><br />There were more than 100 Jaina sites in the Pandya country (comprising<br />the present-day districts of Madurai, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga,<br />Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari in southern<br />Tamil Nadu).<br /><br />The most notable among these were the sites at Madurai, Kazhugumalai,<br />Kurandi (near Aruppukottai) and Nagercoil (Kottaru).<br /><br />"It is not true that Jainism was rooted out of Tamil Nadu after the<br />7th century A.D. A good example of the revival of Jainism in the Tamil<br />country after the 8th century is Kazhugumalai," said Vedachalam.<br /><br />Arun Raj said important Jaina sites in the southern districts were<br />Tiruparankunram, Anai Malai, Azhagar Malai, Mankulam, Arittapatti,<br />Kizhavalavu, Vikramangalam, Mettupatti, Muthupatti, Kongarpuliyankulam<br />and Karuvalangudi. Jainism also flourished at Sitthannavasal in<br />Pudukottai district. In northern Tamil Nadu, there were Jaina sites at<br />Tirunarungkondai, Tirunatharkunru, Mel Kudalur, Mel Sithamur, Jambai,<br />Tirumalai, Thondur, Paraiyan Pattu and Thalavanur.<br /><br />Structural Jaina temples came up at Agazhur near Ginjee, Veedur near<br />Villupuram, Peramallur and Mel Sithamur (both near Tindivanam),<br />Tirunarungkondai near Ulundurpet, Melmalayanur, and Tiruparutikunram,<br />3 kilometres from Kancheepuram.<br /><br />Of all these sites, the largest number of Jaina bas-reliefs is found<br />at Kazhugumalai. "There are more Jaina sculptures here than even at<br />Tirumalai. The sculptures here have richness and variety. They are not<br />monotonous," said Vedachalam.<br /><br />On top of the Kazhugumalai hills is an Ayyanar temple, which is about<br />a hundred years old. The temple obscures some of the basÂ–reliefs<br />behind it. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple is inside a natural<br />cavern. As the priest lit a lamp to show us the roof of the dark<br />cavern, three bas-reliefs of Tirthankaras came into view near the<br />Ayyanar image.<br /><br />Two of them sat side by side and the third was a few feet away. They<br />were seated in ardhapariyankasana, under a triple umbrella. It is<br />difficult to say whether these Jaina carvings have been documented.<br />Remarkable Beauty<br /><br />A bas-relief of remarkable beauty in Kazhugumalai depicts the legend<br />of the yakshi Ambika. The sculpture shows a tall and elegant Ambika,<br />with her two children and her husband, a simha (a lion) and a<br />"kalpavriksha". The husband seems to be in a state of sheer awe, for<br />one of his hands is raised in a state of shock.<br /><br />Legend has it that Ambika violated a religious canon by giving away<br />food she had cooked for her pitrus (ancestors) on a day of<br />remembrance. When her relatives who had come to take part in the<br />ceremony had gone out, a Jaina monk came to her house seeking food.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this long frieze on the vimana of Vettuvan Kovil ganas can be seen<br />dancing and playing musical instruments.<br /><br />When the relatives returned home and found that she had given away the<br />food to the monk, they were enraged with her and drove her out. She<br />sought out the monk and asked him to help.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Yakshi Ambika with her children, the simha (lion) and<br />kalpavriksha. Her husband is shown with a hand raised and his face has<br />no detailing so as to depict his awe and the glare from her "golden<br />appearance" falling on him.<br /><br />He pleaded helplessness and suggested that she go back to her husband.<br />Scared of her husband's wrath, Ambika, committed suicide. She reached<br />heaven and became an attendant, that is, a yakshi, of Tirthankara<br />Neminatha.<br /><br />But Ambika was unable to forget her past and Indra granted her a boon<br />that she could return to earth and live with her husband while at the<br />same time being a yakshi. Back home, her husband demanded that she<br />show him her "golden appearance" to prove she was a yakshi.<br /><br />When Ambika revealed her true self, the husband was taken aback by the<br />dazzling halo. That is why his hand, in the sculpture, is raised and<br />the face, with the glare, perhaps, is not deliberately sculpted.<br /><br />"There are sculptures of the yakshi Ambika at Sitharal [near<br />Nagercoil], Anai Malai and Samana Malai [both near Madurai] and<br />Tirumalai. But this one at Kazhugumalai is the masterpiece," said<br />Vedachalam.<br /><br />Another masterpiece is the sculpture of Bahubali (Gomatesvara)<br />standing in meditation in a forest, with creepers entwining his legs,<br />and his sisters Brahmi and Sundari telling him to shed his ego.<br />Bahubali was one of the two sons of the first Tirthankara, Adinatha.<br />(Bahubali himself is not a Tirthankara.)<br /><br /><br /><br />THE VIMANA OF Vettuvan Kovil shows Dakshinamurti playing the<br />mridangam. He is generally shown playing the veena.<br /><br />Adinatha split his kingdom between his two sons, Bahubali and<br />Bharatha, before renouncing the world. A conflict between the two<br />brought their armies against each other. But not wanting lives to be<br />lost, Bahubali and Bharatha decided to settle it between themselves.<br /><br />Bahubali won two of the three combats but when he was about to kill<br />his brother in the third, he had a change of heart. He renounced<br />everything. He went to the forest to meditate, but was not able to<br />shed his ego. So Adinatha sent his two daughters, who told him to "get<br />rid of the elephant in his head".<br /><br />A third carving depicts the story of the Tirthankara Parsvanatha Â–<br />with snakehoods over his head, Kamdan throwing a huge piece of rock to<br />kill him, the yaksha Dharnendra protecting him, and finally Kamdan<br />surrendering to him. Yakshi Padmavathi is also seen.<br /><br />Sivaramamurti has written that "the panel of standing Parsvanatha with<br />the snakehoods over his head is a gem of early Pandya art".<br />Vatteluttu Inscriptions<br /><br />Kazhugumalai is also famous for its surfeit of vatteluttu<br />inscriptions. There are inscriptions below many bas-reliefs Â– they are<br />called label inscriptions.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bahubali, or Gomatesvara, stands in meditation in a forest, with<br />creepers entwined around his legs. His sisters Brahmi and Sundari are<br />seen as telling him to "shed his ego".<br /><br />There are 102 inscriptions at Kazhugumalai said Arun Raj. Of them, 100<br />relate to Jainism and the remaining, Saivism. The Jaina inscriptions<br />mainly talk about the Tirthankaras and the donors who paid for<br />sculpting their bas-reliefs. The donors included local merchants,<br />carpenters, teachers, students, and so on.<br /><br />The bas-reliefs were made in memory of dead relatives, too.
