			<div class="content">There are many translations for this specific one stanza of Anubuthi.<br />Anubuthi is a brilliant work and my personal favourite. Each hymn, is <br />very thoughtful, intense and deep. <br /><br />Here is what I believe in, it is long, I hope to keep it a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> crisp <br />and interesting with Why and How included: <br /><br />Uruvai Aruvai ulathai ilathai, <br />The form that you have taken from being a formless (ONE) entity, you <br />are being that of existant and that is nonexistant.<br /><br />Maruvai malarai,<br />The material of flower and its life of fragrance, the beauty of jewel <br />and its potrayal by light.<br />A flower without fragrance is not to be on value, hence the lord <br />gives the flower and its fragrance, Skanda does the purpose and the <br />sense of purpose.<br /><br />maniyai oliyai<br />Same with the jewel, when a gem is in a dark room, it is not going to <br />be of value, that light that makes the stone to a jewel is what <br />skanda offers, our Guha has the Self embodied into it, He is the <br />light of Guru, which brings the Self out of its Guha as Guru Guha.<br />(read - subramanya bujangam - Guha is explained below).<br /><br />Karuvai Uyirai<br />The Body and the Self, you are the Self and its Shell and the five <br />layers connecting between them. Karu is body as in Siva and Uyir is <br />Self as in Shakti as per one one thought.<br /><br />Gathiyai vithiyai<br />The solace who is my destiny to remove my bondage of life and death.<br /><br />Guruvai varuvai arulvai Guhane.<br />You are my master, The Lord here as prescribed is to be taken in <br />words from above prior to bottling him up as a master who does <br />upadesam. The Guru is everything, any one you learn from becomes a <br />Guru - for that instant, the God's representative, hence is greater <br />than God himself for the presentation layer is everythin. Hence you <br />learn from the day you are born, mother is a Guru, Father is, your <br />educator is, God is... so Guru is you, My Lord.<br />Let me know the bliss, Guhane - that word Guhane is extremely apt in <br />here. It shows the relation from the words as above, where Guru <br />Arunagiri points one to the Self inside the Guha, our Self that sits <br />beyond Body - Breath - Mind - Memory - Intellect - Ego - The SELF.<br />The first 6 parts constitute the dark cave or Guhai and the one who <br />is eternal and lives inside that waiting for the call is the form of <br />all prevading light called as Guhan.<br /><br />-- R<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Original Tamil poem in my blog<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06 ... anuputi51/</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  You who have form and who are formless,<br />  you who are both being and non being,<br />  who are the fragrance and the blossom,<br />  who are the jewel and its lusture,<br />  who are the seed of life and life itself,<br />  who are mode and act of existence,<br />  who are supreme guru,come<br />  bestow your grace,o Guha.<br />  Translated by Kamil V Zvelebil<br />  <br />  Formed,Formless;<br />  Being,Non being;<br />  Flower,Fragrance;<br />  Jewel,Radiance;<br />  Embryo,Life;<br />  Goal and Way;<br />  Come,Guha,Guru;<br />  Grant your Grace.<br />  Translated by Fred W Clothey<br />  <br />  The one who appears as Formed,as formless;as a Being,as a Non-Being;<br />  as Fragrance,as a Flower;as a Jewel, as its Radiance;<br />  as an Embryo,as a Life; as a way<br />  and as destiny;As a Guru come here; Grant your Grace to me Guha.<br />  My own translation &#40;very close to the structure of the Original <br />Tamil<br />  poem,slightly modified Clothey&#39;s Translation to match the structure<br />  of the original Tamil poem&#41;<br />  <br />  Unless and until you know Tamil and you can read this poem in <br />Tamil, you<br />  can never completely enjoy this poem.

			<div class="content">Hi SPS<br /><br />Thirupugazh is translated by many, Indians and westerners also. Each <br />one gets his own interpretation.<br />Pure literature wise, it is rich but the translation alone makes not <br />much sense.<br /><br />However, if you read it with various views in place, it is possibly <br />the best known poem collection of over 1300 songs in tamil (16000 in <br />actual only 1322 have been recovered). If we translate Guru <br />Arunagiri's works as just simple tamil translation, it will be likely <br />to land up as erotic literature in most cases.<br /><br />Thiru Muruga Vaariyar had translated a lot of these songs, I am <br />gifted to be blessed with some of those books. I can try and post a <br />few of that along with other translations. I will thank the Lord for <br />using me.<br /><br />Thirupugazh is also a form of The Githa in tamil, if I may say. The <br />prime difference being thirupugazh talks of all paths to God and does <br />not conclude on who is the One. Guru Arunagiri, lets us take these <br />songs and move us to invoke our own creativity and travel inside.<br /><br />For ex, his first thirupugazh song: <br />Muthai tharu pathith thirunagai<br />athikkirai satthi saravana<br />muthikkoru vithukkurupara....<br /><br />English literal translation: <br />You are the Consort of Devayaanai* with a beautiful smile and lovely <br />teeth looking like pearls! <br />You are SaravaNabhava holding the powerful spear called SakthivEl!<br />You are the foremost seed for the Heaven"<br /><br /><br />He starts of saying 'Oh Consort of Devayani, who has smile as clear <br />as a string of pearls'<br />Invoking Devayani - the power of creativity, kriya shakti. He calls <br />her to help the 'sol' or 'vaaku' or 'pulamai' hence addresses the <br />smile of the lord as string of pearls, now if you read deeper and <br />repuzzle his words, you can see that he wants Mother Devayani to <br />guide the Lord to talk through him.<br />Perumal kitte varam ketta kidaikathu, thayar siru <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> jadai kidaithal <br />mukthiye kidaikum nu soluvanga, same story here.<br />Now the next two lines, Sathi saravana - the shakti vel (use of the <br />term shaktivel - potent energy) that raises from the kundalini sows <br />the seed that leads one to mukthi by the words of the upadesam of the <br />Almighty Guru himself.<br />The words are so carefully pinned into each other that they can be <br />easily dismissed without any notice when we read them as literature.<br /><br />in 4 lines, Guru Arunagiri has so much meaning, it is a whole library <br />to decode his works.<br /><br />But then, it has to start somewhere.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>- Dear Ravi,<br />  <br />  That is DENSE Translation - with deep inner meaning !<br />  <br />  Excellent..
