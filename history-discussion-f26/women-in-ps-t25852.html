She involved herself too much in 'porantha veedu' (like most of the females do after they get married) the only difference is she was ahead that she wanted to marry a person who gives her a hand in doing that(mind u she doesn't choose a dumb person like kandamaran/parthiban who would be even more obliging than vandiyatevan) . she believed in Horoscope of her brother 100% that he will go places. Take into fact that chola desam at the stage was badly in need of a shape and good team co-ordination she goes one step ahead leading the good set of males she knew(vandiyatevan/rajaraja and in future rajendra).

			<div class="content">You know .. I am most fascinated by Kundavai (the historical character.. not <br />the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> character). Think about it this way.. Tamizh Nadu, even today is <br />fairly male dominated and male chauvinistic. Let us assume for an instance <br />that things haven't changed all that much in over a 1000 years (of course <br />people might well claim that a 1000 years ago TN was less male chauvinistic <br />than it is today.. although I wouldn't want to bet on it). In which case the <br />fact that a woman was so heavily involved in her "porantha veedu" is <br />completely amazing.. Given societal norms, would Vandiyathevan have been a <br />laughing stock of the makkaL in general? Kinda like "atho paaru da.. <br />pondatti avanai vittututu inga irukkan".. "avanukku pondattiya vechchu <br />kaappaaththa thuppu illai" etc <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Just something to ponder about!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />AK<br /><br />On 9/8/05, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>ithaththaan<br />  <br />  ithaththaan<br />  naan ethir paarththEn<br />  <br />  meena now tell me how many of the 4 women really achieved what they<br />  had set to achieve<br />  <br />  who were the success stories and who the failures?<br />  <br />  <br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, meenakshi perumal<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    We should take into account the important fact that character &<br />  behaviour of every women in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is greatly influenced by the way they<br />  were brought up/comforts/family background/exposture.Family plays a<br />  very important role as females are more emotionally attached to<br />  everything.No women in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is potrayed as blunt rude or villi.<br />   <br />    Accept the fact or not male races are greatly influenced by women<br />  in general knowingly or unknowingly.<br />   <br />    Kundavai- She had maids to attend her personal chores, all the<br />  comforts and exposture and the freedom of voice and offcource her<br />  drive to learn new things. She involved herself too much in &#39;porantha<br />  veedu&#39; &#40;like most of the females do after they get married&#41; the only<br />  difference is she was ahead that she wanted to marry a person who<br />  gives her a hand in doing that&#40;mind u she doesn&#39;t choose a dumb<br />  person like kandamaran/parthiban who would be even more obliging than<br />  vandiyatevan&#41; . she believed in Horoscope of her brother 100% that he<br />  will go places.

			<div class="content">Dear Arun Krishnan,<br /><br /><br />Yes. I agree that tamil society was occupied by the<br />male cahvinists once. Being a Girl, it is<br />apprecitiable that Kundavan had a committment to be in<br />Chola Desam only which was very rare decision. In that<br />context that's ok. But, Kuzhali can drive the boat<br />alone, she could guide Vanthiyathevan,... i feel, if<br />we ask "is there any Bharthai kanda Puthumai pen in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>?, i would say Kuzhali rather than Kunthavai.<br /><br />anbudan, Ramki<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br />Click here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://store.yahoo.com/redcross-donate3/">http://store.yahoo.com/redcross-donate3/</a><!-- m --></div>
