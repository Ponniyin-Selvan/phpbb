			<div class="content">continuing from the prev post<br /><br />Phanum rung<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sundial.thai-isan-lao.com/phanom_rung_sun-rises.html">http://www.sundial.thai-isan-lao.com/ph ... rises.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The rays of the sun pass straight through the door-ways of Prasat <br />Phanom Rung 4 times a year (2 sunrises and 2 sunsets). The sunrise <br />events are in April and September, the sunset events are in March <br />and October.<br />Each solar event last 3 days, on the 2nd of which the sun is <br />visible aligned straight with the structure of the ancient Khmer <br />Hindu temple. On the 1st and 3rd day the sun is observable passing <br />one of the corners of the door-ways.<br />If the temple was oriented straight east (90 degrees from true <br />north) the solar events would happen on the 2 equinox days, but the <br />orientation of Prasat Phanom Rung is 84.5 degrees. This difference <br />in orientation results in that the solar events as a rule of thumb <br />fall 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after equinox. The calculation of <br />the solar events at Prasat Phanom Rung is therefore rather simple: <br />Determine the equinox days and add/subtract 14 days.<br />It must be emphasised that this rule of thumb must be followed <br />by more exact calculations for the year in question<br /><br />The pyramids<br /><br />The pyramids, however, are set out with the greatest accuracy. Mr <br />Petrie's careful survey shows that the Great Pyramid deviated only <br />5Ã‚Â´, and he says that it is the world that has shifted rather than <br />the structureÃ¢Â€"no fault to its builders! The group of three, <br />moreover, stand en echelon, so that each has its four sides clear to <br />the four quarters to which Mariette says they were dedicated. On the <br />east side of each was a small isolated temple with its door <br />eastward. One of these is the so-called temple of the Sphinx. 'It is <br />to be noticed,' Mr Proctor says, 'that the peculiar figure and <br />position of the pyramids will bring about the following relations. <br />Between the autumn and the spring equinoxes the rays of the rising <br />and setting sun illuminated the southern face of the pyramids; <br />whereas during the rest of the year, that is, the six months between <br />the spring and autumn equinoxes, the rays of the rising and setting <br />sun illuminated the northern face.' The slanting passage appears to <br />have pointed directly to the pole star.<br /><br />Examples in india:<br /><br />Statue of Surya at Konarak Temple in India<br /><br />The temple was designed so that the rays of the rising and setting <br />sun at the time of the equinoxes illuminated the image of Surya.<br /><br />Vidyashankara Temple<br /><br />The temple architecture is also an exhibition of the astronomical <br />expertise of medieval south Indian temple builders. The main temple <br />hall features 12 pillars designated for the 12 signs of the zodiac. <br />Windows and doors along the temple walls are arranged such that at <br />the start of each solar month in the Indian calendar, the sun's rays <br />fall on the pillar designated for the zodiac sign of that month.<br /><br />Thiru Vattaaru - Sri Aadhikesava Perumal Temple<br /><br />Another speciality of this sthalam is the way in which the perumal <br />is positioned. He is found in such a way that everyday he gives his <br />seva to Chandiran, the moon god. During the setting of sun, the rays <br />of the sun is falling on the Moolavar's face as though it says that <br />it will leave today and come tomorrow. After the sun sets, the moon <br />appears (or) rises from the same direction where the sun sets and <br />first sees the Moolavar and get his dharshan. This is one of the <br />speciality of this sthalam (ie) the perumal's position. <br /><br />Belur - Chennakeshavaswamy Temple<br /><br />Hassan - "Rashmi Utsava", for next three days at the sun's rays <br />will pass through the main entrance of the temple in three different <br />directions and illuminate the feet of Channakeshavaswamy idol, - sun-<br />rays will enter the sanctum sanctorum through the main entrance from <br />the right corner on the first day and from the left corner on second <br />day. the third day - is an important day as the rays will pass <br />through the central point of the main entrance and touch the feet of <br />the idol. This day will be the ninth day of Mesha month in the Hindu <br />almanac, the line connecting the east and west will be at 180 <br />degrees.<br /><br />THE TIRUPPALTHURAI Mahadeva temple 14 km. from Tiruchi, on the <br />Srirangam-Grand Anicut road, belongs to the 9th century<br /><br />On the third day of the Tamil month of Purattasi and Panguni the <br />rays of the rising sun used to fall on the Adimuleswarar Lingam in <br />the sanctum sanctorum. <br /><br />Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple, (Indian rock-cut architecture) <br />bangalore<br /><br />The ancient temple was cut out of the rock probably in the 9th <br />century. It is a natural monolith rock formation with the cave <br />temple carved out of it. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple <br />has four monolithic pillars and a rare idol of Agni, the God of fire.<br /><br />Thousands of devotees come in January every year on Makar sankranti <br />Day to this cave temple. This is a special day when the sunrays fall <br />on the Sivalinga for one hour as it passes between the horns of the <br />Nandi. Such was the knowledge of architecture and astronomy that the <br />ancient sculptors could craft the horns of the stone bull outside <br />the temple so that the sun's rays would pass through its horns and <br />light up the deity Shiva Linga inside the cave<br /><br />look forward to expert comments - how about the settings in the <br />shore temple of mamallapuram or the big temple. eager to know<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Many cultures celebrate various combinations of the winter and <br />  summer solstices, the equinoxes, and the midpoints between them, <br />  leading to various holidays arising around these events. <br />  <br />  In most cultures the solstices and equinoxes also determine the <br />  midpoint of the seasons, which can be seen in the celebrations <br />  called midsummer and midwinter. <br />  <br />  Right from the stone henge <br />  <br />  &#40;http://homepages.tcp.co.uk/%7Eait/pics05/ghstone.jpg&#41; to the <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060621.html">http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060621.html</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  temples of angkor - man has built structures keeping the <br />solistices <br />  in mind...<br />  <br />  <br />  machu peechu<br />  <br />  A number of features distributed throughout the site are aligned <br />  with the June solstice azimuth of 65-245 degrees.

			<div class="content">Nageswaran Temple<br /><br />Nageswaran Temple, is dedicated to Shiva in the guise of Nagaraja, <br />the serpent king. Also known as "Koothandavar Kovil", it is located <br />near the Kumbakonam old bus stand. Aditya Chola constructed this <br />temple during the 12th century. It stands as a great marvel of Chola <br />architecture, building technology and astronomy. The design and <br />orientation are structured in such a way that it allows sunlight <br />inside the temple only during the Tamil month of Chithirai <br />(April/May), therefore, it bears another name called Surya Kottam or <br />Keel Kottam. ...vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>continuing from the prev post<br />  <br />  Phanum rung<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sundial.thai-isan-lao.com/phanom_rung_sun-rises.html">http://www.sundial.thai-isan-lao.com/ph ... rises.html</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  The rays of the sun pass straight through the door-ways of Prasat <br />  Phanom Rung 4 times a year &#40;2 sunrises and 2 sunsets&#41;. The sunrise <br />  events are in April and September, the sunset events are in March <br />  and October.<br />  Each solar event last 3 days, on the 2nd of which the sun is <br />  visible aligned straight with the structure of the ancient Khmer <br />  Hindu temple. On the 1st and 3rd day the sun is observable passing <br />  one of the corners of the door-ways.<br />  If the temple was oriented straight east &#40;90 degrees from <br />true <br />  north&#41; the solar events would happen on the 2 equinox days, but <br />the <br />  orientation of Prasat Phanom Rung is 84.5 degrees. This difference <br />  in orientation results in that the solar events as a rule of thumb <br />  fall 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after equinox. The calculation of <br />  the solar events at Prasat Phanom Rung is therefore rather simple: <br />  Determine the equinox days and add/subtract 14 days.<br />  It must be emphasised that this rule of thumb must be <br />followed <br />  by more exact calculations for the year in question<br />  <br />  The pyramids<br />  <br />  The pyramids, however, are set out with the greatest accuracy. Mr <br />  Petrie&#39;s careful survey shows that the Great Pyramid deviated only <br />  5Ã‚Â´, and he says that it is the world that has shifted rather than <br />  the structureÃ¢Â€Â¦quot;no fault to its builders! The group of three, <br />  moreover, stand en echelon, so that each has its four sides clear <br />to <br />  the four quarters to which Mariette says they were dedicated. On <br />the <br />  east side of each was a small isolated temple with its door <br />  eastward. One of these is the so-called temple of the Sphinx. &#39;It <br />is <br />  to be noticed,&#39; Mr Proctor says, &#39;that the peculiar figure and <br />  position of the pyramids will bring about the following relations. <br />  Between the autumn and the spring equinoxes the rays of the rising <br />  and setting sun illuminated the southern face of the pyramids; <br />  whereas during the rest of the year, that is, the six months <br />between <br />  the spring and autumn equinoxes, the rays of the rising and <br />setting <br />  sun illuminated the northern face.&#39; The slanting passage appears <br />to <br />  have pointed directly to the pole star.<br />  <br />  Examples in india:<br />  <br />  Statue of Surya at Konarak Temple in India<br />  <br />  The temple was designed so that the rays of the rising and setting <br />  sun at the time of the equinoxes illuminated the image of Surya.<br />  <br />  Vidyashankara Temple<br />  <br />  The temple architecture is also an exhibition of the astronomical <br />  expertise of medieval south Indian temple builders. The main <br />temple <br />  hall features 12 pillars designated for the 12 signs of the <br />zodiac. <br />  Windows and doors along the temple walls are arranged such that at <br />  the start of each solar month in the Indian calendar, the sun&#39;s <br />rays <br />  fall on the pillar designated for the zodiac sign of that month.<br />  <br />  Thiru Vattaaru - Sri Aadhikesava Perumal Temple<br />  <br />  Another speciality of this sthalam is the way in which the perumal <br />  is positioned. He is found in such a way that everyday he gives <br />his <br />  seva to Chandiran, the moon god. During the setting of sun, the <br />rays <br />  of the sun is falling on the Moolavar&#39;s face as though it says <br />that <br />  it will leave today and come tomorrow. After the sun sets, the <br />moon <br />  appears &#40;or&#41; rises from the same direction where the sun sets and <br />  first sees the Moolavar and get his dharshan. This is one of the <br />  speciality of this sthalam &#40;ie&#41; the perumal&#39;s position. <br />  <br />  Belur - Chennakeshavaswamy Temple<br />  <br />  Hassan - "Rashmi Utsava", for next three days at the sun&#39;s rays <br />  will pass through the main entrance of the temple in three <br />different <br />  directions and illuminate the feet of Channakeshavaswamy idol, - <br />sun-<br />  rays will enter the sanctum sanctorum through the main entrance <br />from <br />  the right corner on the first day and from the left corner on <br />second <br />  day. the third day - is an important day as the rays will pass <br />  through the central point of the main entrance and touch the feet <br />of <br />  the idol. This day will be the ninth day of Mesha month in the <br />Hindu <br />  almanac, the line connecting the east and west will be at 180 <br />  degrees.<br />  <br />  THE TIRUPPALTHURAI Mahadeva temple 14 km. from Tiruchi, on the <br />  Srirangam-Grand Anicut road, belongs to the 9th century<br />  <br />  On the third day of the Tamil month of Purattasi and Panguni the <br />  rays of the rising sun used to fall on the Adimuleswarar Lingam in <br />  the sanctum sanctorum. <br />  <br />  Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple, &#40;Indian rock-cut architecture&#41; <br />  bangalore<br />  <br />  The ancient temple was cut out of the rock probably in the 9th <br />  century. It is a natural monolith rock formation with the cave <br />  temple carved out of it. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple <br />  has four monolithic pillars and a rare idol of Agni, the God of <br />fire.<br />  <br />  Thousands of devotees come in January every year on Makar <br />sankranti <br />  Day to this cave temple. This is a special day when the sunrays <br />fall <br />  on the Sivalinga for one hour as it passes between the horns of <br />the <br />  Nandi. Such was the knowledge of architecture and astronomy that <br />the <br />  ancient sculptors could craft the horns of the stone bull outside <br />  the temple so that the sun&#39;s rays would pass through its horns and <br />  light up the deity Shiva Linga inside the cave<br />  <br />  look forward to expert comments - how about the settings in the <br />  shore temple of mamallapuram or the big temple. eager to know<br />  <br />  vj<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Many cultures celebrate various combinations of the winter and <br />    summer solstices, the equinoxes, and the midpoints between them, <br />    leading to various holidays arising around these events. <br />    <br />    In most cultures the solstices and equinoxes also determine the <br />    midpoint of the seasons, which can be seen in the celebrations <br />    called midsummer and midwinter. <br />    <br />    Right from the stone henge <br />    <br />    &#40;http://homepages.tcp.co.uk/%7Eait/pics05/ghstone.jpg&#41; to the <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060621.html">http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060621.html</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    temples of angkor - man has built structures keeping the <br />  solistices <br />    in mind...<br />    <br />    <br />    machu peechu<br />    <br />    A number of features distributed throughout the site are aligned <br />    with the June solstice azimuth of 65-245 degrees. The Sacred <br />Plaza <br />    is enclosed on three sides but is open to the west with an <br />  alignment <br />    of 245 degrees. The Temple of the Three Windows forming the <br />  easterly <br />    side of the plaza, opens to the plaza and faces the solstice <br />  sunset. <br />    The Intihuatana platform is oriented to 65-245 degrees with a <br />  shaped <br />    replica stone of Huayna Picchu in its center. The solstice <br />    alignment, and the importance of solstice ritual to the Inca, <br />    suggest that this was a primary ceremonial consideration of this <br />    shrine. The Torreon is popularly called the Temple of the Sun. A <br />    stone enclosed within the Torreon is reported to receive a ray <br />of <br />    sun light through the east facing window during the June <br />solstice. <br />    <br />    <br />    New grange - ireland<br />    <br />    The passage and chamber of Newgrange are illuminated by the <br />winter <br />    solstice sunrise.
