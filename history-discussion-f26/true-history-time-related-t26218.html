			<div class="content">Vairam,<br /><br />Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your site, i was wondering about the <br />intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about criticizing a community (atleast <br />to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in any of the sitthar songs<br /><br />First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. Second is just acomparison to <br />say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this method of comparison.<br /><br />Can you post the full song and the translation from the book are quoting this? Please post <br />from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses were criticizing brahmin <br />dominated community?<br /><br />Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those years. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Original Tamil poems are in the blog<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/17/civakaviyam2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05 ... akaviyam2/</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the Brahmin<br />  dominated society and caste system of his period.

			<div class="content">The words in tamil sound different from words in english...to me <br />atleast. <br />As with any words, it is in the eye of the beholder.<br />I read it as a hardcore siva thathuvam and i would also deduce the <br />pariah / brahmin to iccha/kriya to be embedded inside the body.<br />I am not to believe Sivavakiyar was into social reforms and there is <br />no reason to believe so. His words from other poems also seem <br />pointing to a higher end of philosophy and siva thathuvams.<br />--- etho yen sitrarivukku yettiyathu...<br /><br />Mr.Vairam, revisiting the older thread, has there been any study of <br />the St.Bogar and his uruva vazhipadu of Lord Muruga compared to the <br />1st sangam age? <br />Any documentation of Bogar's time line to Nakeerar or pallava <br />dynasty, i would be curious.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam,<br />  <br />  Thanks for the post.

When I read the tamil lines from your site, i<br />    was wondering about the <br />      intro given. None of the two stanza&#39;s talk anything about<br />    criticizing a community &#40;atleast <br />      to my knowledge&#41;. Both are very generic and a common trend in any <br />  of<br />    the sitthar songs<br />      <br />      First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. Second <br />  is<br />    just a comparison to <br />      say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this method <br />  of<br />    comparison.<br />      <br />      Can you post the full song and the translation from the book are<br />    quoting this? Please post <br />      from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses were<br />    criticizing brahmin <br />      dominated community?<br />      <br />      Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those years. <br />      <br />      Regards,<br />      Satish<br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br />       <br />        <br />        Original Tamil poems are in the blog<br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/17/civakaviyam2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05 ... akaviyam2/</a><!-- m --><br />        <br />        Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the Brahmin<br />        dominated society and caste system of his period.
