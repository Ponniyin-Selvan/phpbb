			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I was in the Surpeme Court covering the Ram Setu hearing today. SubramaniamSwamy today read out this letter in the court telling the judges how a British wanted ASI survey on Ram Setu.<br /><br />A.Vaidyanathan<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Vijay Kumar .S <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Wednesday, May 7, 2008 5:36:12 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] A British Governorâ€™s romance with Ram Sethu <br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://newstodaynet.com/printer">http://newstodaynet.com/printer</a><!-- m -->. php?id=7165<br /><br />A British Governor's romance with Ram Sethu <br /><br /><br /><br />V SUNDARAM | Mon, 05 May, 2008 , 03:22 PM <br />. <br /><br />It is reliably understood that in the ongoing Ram Sethu Case, the <br />Hon. Supreme Court of India asked the Senior Counsel <br />Sri.Venugopal `Did anybody request the Archeological Survey of India <br />(ASI) to undertake an extensive survey of the area in and around Ram <br />Sethu in Rameswaram, even prior to 1999?' The answer to this <br />question is straight and simple.<br /><br /><br />The Rt. Honourable Lord Pentland (1860-1925 )<br />Governor of Madras (1912-1919)<br /><br /><br />Lord Pentland, a British Governor of Madras Presidency from 1912 <br />to 1919, had a great fascination for Rameshwaram in general and Ram <br />Sethu in particular. Before coming to Madras in 1912, he had a <br />distinguished career as Secretary of Scotland and as Aide-de-Camp <br />and Official Secretary to Lord Aberdeen in Ireland in 1886 and in <br />Canada. He sat as Liberal member for Dumbartonshire and Forfarshire <br />in the House of Commons and acted as Parliamentary Secretary to Sir <br />Henry Campbell Bannerman for many years. He did outstanding War work <br />between 1914 and 1918 in the Presidency of Madras, ably assisted by <br />his public-spirited wife Lady Pentland. Both of them together raised <br />a large sum of money for building a magnificent Hospital Ship <br />equipped and maintained by the people of Madras, during the I World <br />War. This Hospital Ship created military history by plying <br />regularly between Africa and India, and subsequently between <br />Mesapotomia and India and rendering a splendid and much needed <br />medical service in those hectic and turbulent days. <br /><br />Lord and Lady Pentland were deeply interested in Hindu Religion, <br />Hindu culture, Hindu mythology and Hindu philosophy.Lord Pentland <br />visited Rameshwaram in 1914 when Sir Alexander Tottenham (1873-1946) <br />was the District Collector of Ramanathapuram. Lord Pentland was so <br />overwhelmed by what he saw in Rameshwaram that he wrote as follows <br />to Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India on 1st December <br />1914: `For me Rameshwaram, very much like India as a whole is the <br />real world. We English men live in a mad house of abstractions. <br />Vital life in Rameshwaram has not yet withdrawn into the capsule of <br />the head. It is the whole body that lives. No wonder the English man <br />feels dreamlike: the complete life of Rameshwaram is something of <br />which he merely dreams.... I did not see an English man in India who <br />really lived there. They are all living in England, that is, in a <br />sort of bottle filled with English air.... History can be events or <br />memory of events.... along the Bay of Bengal the Madras Presidency <br />runs, with the well-governed city of Madras at its center and the <br />sublime and glorious temples of Tanjore, Tiruchi, Madurai and <br />Rameshwaram adorning its Southern boundaries. And then Adam's Bridge-<br />a reef of sunken islands' beckons us across the Palk Straits to <br />Ceylon, where civilization flourished more than 2000 years <br />ago....Linga stones may be seen in many places on the highways in my <br />Presidency. Hindus break upon them the coconuts which they are about <br />to offer in sacrifice. Usually the phallic ritual is simple and <br />becoming; it consists in anointing the stone with consecrated water <br />or oil, and decorating it with leaves. At the Rameshwaram temple, <br />the Linga stone is daily washed with Ganga water, which is <br />afterwards sold to the pious, as holy water or mesmerized water has <br />been sold in Europe. All these are a little part of my beloved <br />Presidency - indeed my favourite India. Right from the dawn of <br />history, India is extraordinarily continuous in time. In space, on <br />the other hand, it is extraordinarily discontinuous. ... from early <br />times in India, it is ethnology, philology, and archaeology that <br />give and will give us some notions of the truth. From archaeology <br />much can be expected. I would earnestly request you to direct the <br />Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to undertake an extensive and <br />intensive survey of Rameshwaram and its beautiful environs, <br />particularly with reference to the historic and primordial Adam's <br />Bridge'. After 93 years and 60 years after our independence, this <br />very request of Lord Pentland made in 1914 for the conduct of an <br />intensive and extensive archeological survey of Rameswaram and Ram <br />Sethu by the ASI , was again reiterated by Dr Subramanian Swamy in <br />his letter sent to Mrs Ambika Soni, Union Minister for Culture on <br />March 3, 2007. This known anti-Hindu Christian Minister for Culture <br />(a political tenant- at â€“will totally at the mercy of Sonia Gandhi!) <br />treated Dr.Swami's reasonable request made in the larger public <br />interest with supreme-Sonia contempt and hatred.<br /><br />Sir. Alexander Tottenham I.C.S. <br />( 1873-1946)<br />B Dewan of Pudukkottai <br />(1934-1946)<br /><br />I got to know about Lord Pentland's letter of December 1914 <br />addressed to Lord Hardinge from my friend Late Shri.K.Nagarajan of <br />Pudukkottai. He was a great friend of Sir.Alexander Tottenham ICS <br />who was Dewan of Pudukkotttai from 1934 to 1946. Tottenham passed <br />away in Pudukkotai on December 13 1946. He lies buried in the <br />Lutheran Mission Churchyard at Machuvadi in Pudukkottai. As Dewan of <br />Pudukkottai, Tottenham became a legend as a great public servantâ€”a <br />good man, noble,, just and generous. <br />Tottenham had given the excerpts from the letter of Lord Pentland <br />addressed to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India (already referred <br />to above) to Shri.K.Nagarajan and Shri.K.Nagarajan was good enough <br />to give me in December 1984, a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham's <br />letter dated 6th December 1941 addressed to Shri.K.Nagarajan. This <br />is a historic letter which speaks for itself. I am giving below a <br />facsimile of this letter of Sir.Alexander Tottenham dated 6th <br />December 1941.<br /><br />Though Lord Pentland had recommended a Survey of the area in and <br />around Ram Sethu in December 1914 to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of <br />India, yet no action was immediately taken by the Government of <br />India because of the intervention of the I World War Even after the <br />end of the I World War, nothing was done because the allocation of <br />funds for archeological work was substantially reduced during the <br />inter-war period between 1919 to 1939. The political turmoil created <br />by the rising independence movement in India also contributed to <br />this process. With the advent of II World War on September 3 1939, <br />all archeological survey work came to a standstill till 1945. This <br />position was clearly explained by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Director <br />General of Archeology in 1946. <br /><br />After our Independence, the Congress Government under Nehru <br />functioned as an Islamic anti-Hindu Government. The assassination of <br />Mahatma Gandhi on 30th January 1948, only strengthened the hands of <br />Congress Party to crush the spirit and culture of the Hindus of <br />India in a systematic manner. Nehru saw to it that the new <br />Constitution of India gave greater privileges and protection to the <br />anti-national Muslims of India who had just 1 year earlier in 1946 <br />voted enmasse for Muslim League and Pakistan. In a criminal <br />fashion, Nehru admitted the very same anti-national Muslim members <br />into the Congress Party, who had earlier voted for Jinnah and his <br />Pakistan. This `glorious' anti-Hindu tradition has reached its <br />climax under UPA Government today. The anti-national Sachar <br />Committee is an instance in point. Our surrogate Prime Minister is a <br />disposable pawn in the hands of a woman imposter from Italy who owes <br />no allegiance to the Indian State or the Indian Constitution. As a <br />known anti-Hindu Roman Catholic, she is acting as an active agent of <br />the Pope in Rome whose only programme is to evangelize India by <br />hook or by crook. Their larger hidden plan is to dismember India. It <br />is against this background, in these columns I had written as <br />follows in September 2007: `In my view, Union Shipping Minister TR <br />Baalu, Union Minister for Culture Ambika Soni, Tamil Nadu Chief <br />Minister Karunanidhi are all guilty of uttering unabashed falsehoods <br />when they say in unison, flanked and blessed by non-Hindu and anti-<br />Hindu Sonia Gandhi: `There is no credible or valid or tenable or <br />acceptable archeological or scientific evidence about the existence <br />of Ram Sethu Bridge'. Their deliberate falsehoods, individually or <br />collectively or severally, dished out in this context, not only come <br />into fierce conflict with historically established truths but also <br />raucously (if not `rationally' in the dastardly Dravidian sense!) <br />quarrel among themselves. Das Munshi, Union Minister for <br />Parliamentary Affairs, has squarely beaten the virulently anti-Hindu <br />trio of TR Baalu, Ambika Soni and Karunanidhi by declaring that Ram <br />Sethu Bridge would not be allowed to be destroyed during the UPA <br />rule like the Babri Masjid that was demolished when BJP was in power <br />in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992! More and more original fireworks <br />of similar diabolic duplicity and wickedness can be expected from <br />other anti-Hindu and Islam-embracing Union Ministers like Arjun <br />Singh, Antulay, Mani Shankar Iyer on this very exciting, excitable <br />and Congress-titillatin g `secular theme' of planned destruction of <br />Ram Sethu Bridge as an integral part of the Sethusamudram Shipping <br />Canal Project (SSCP).&quot;<br /><br />K.NAGARAJA IYER (1891-1986)<br /><br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I am indebted to Shri.K.Nagarajan for his <br />kindness in giving me a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham's letter to <br />me. K.Nagarajan was born on 20th June 1893. His father, Shri <br />A.G.Krishnaswamy Aiyar, was the Chief of the Pudukkottai State <br />Police Service. After graduating from Madras Christian College, he <br />joined the Madras Law College and completed his Bachelor of Law <br />course. After 2 years of legal practice in Madurai from 1913 to <br />1915, he settled down as a lawyer in Pudukkottai and continued in <br />his profession till his 82nd year in 1975. He was also State Vakil <br />and Public Prosecutor in Pudukkottai State. In 1980, the Department <br />of Archives of the Tamil Nadu Government, commissioned K.Nagarajan <br />to write a book on the life of Sir.Alexander Tottenham. He completed <br />this work and soon thereafter he passed away in the summer of 1986.<br /><br />The historian is both discoverer and creator. To the uniqueness of <br />his role we have a clue in the very word `HISTORY', which means both <br />the course of the past and the legible account of the past. The <br />historian is always trying to reduce or remove, that ambiguity. If <br />he is successful, he leads his readers to takeâ€”or mistakeâ€”his <br />account for what was really there. Thus the historian sets himself a <br />dangerous, even an impossible, task. That is why, the great Dutch <br />historian, JH Huizinga used the phrase `A Wrestler with the Angel' <br />to describe a historian. The historian can rediscover the past only <br />by the relics it has left for the present. What his imagination is <br />to the poet, facts are to the historian. His exercise of judgement <br />comes in their selection, his art in their arrangement. His method <br />is narrative. His subject is the story of man's past. His function <br />is to make it known.<br /><br />(concluded)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />know-it-all with Yahoo!

Supreme Court of India asked the Senior Counsel <br />  Sri.Venugopal `Did anybody request the Archeological Survey of <br />India <br />  &#40;ASI&#41; to undertake an extensive survey of the area in and around <br />Ram <br />  Sethu in Rameswaram, even prior to 1999?&#39; The answer to this <br />  question is straight and simple.<br />  <br />  <br />  The Rt. Honourable Lord Pentland &#40;1860-1925 &#41;<br />  Governor of Madras &#40;1912-1919&#41;<br />  <br />  <br />  Lord Pentland, a British Governor of Madras Presidency from 1912 <br />  to 1919, had a great fascination for Rameshwaram in general and <br />Ram <br />  Sethu in particular. Before coming to Madras in 1912, he had a <br />  distinguished career as Secretary of Scotland and as Aide-de-Camp <br />  and Official Secretary to Lord Aberdeen in Ireland in 1886 and in <br />  Canada. He sat as Liberal member for Dumbartonshire and <br />Forfarshire <br />  in the House of Commons and acted as Parliamentary Secretary to <br />Sir <br />  Henry Campbell Bannerman for many years. He did outstanding War <br />work <br />  between 1914 and 1918 in the Presidency of Madras, ably assisted <br />by <br />  his public-spirited wife Lady Pentland. Both of them together <br />raised <br />  a large sum of money for building a magnificent Hospital Ship <br />  equipped and maintained by the people of Madras, during the I <br />World <br />  War. This Hospital Ship created military history by plying <br />  regularly between Africa and India, and subsequently between <br />  Mesapotomia and India and rendering a splendid and much needed <br />  medical service in those hectic and turbulent days. <br />  <br />  Lord and Lady Pentland were deeply interested in Hindu Religion, <br />  Hindu culture, Hindu mythology and Hindu philosophy.Lord Pentland <br />  visited Rameshwaram in 1914 when Sir Alexander Tottenham &#40;1873-<br />1946&#41; <br />  was the District Collector of Ramanathapuram. Lord Pentland was so <br />  overwhelmed by what he saw in Rameshwaram that he wrote as follows <br />  to Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India on 1st December <br />  1914: `For me Rameshwaram, very much like India as a whole is the <br />  real world. We English men live in a mad house of abstractions. <br />  Vital life in Rameshwaram has not yet withdrawn into the capsule <br />of <br />  the head. It is the whole body that lives. No wonder the English <br />man <br />  feels dreamlike: the complete life of Rameshwaram is something of <br />  which he merely dreams.... I did not see an English man in India <br />who <br />  really lived there. They are all living in England, that is, in a <br />  sort of bottle filled with English air.... History can be events <br />or <br />  memory of events.... along the Bay of Bengal the Madras Presidency <br />  runs, with the well-governed city of Madras at its center and the <br />  sublime and glorious temples of Tanjore, Tiruchi, Madurai and <br />  Rameshwaram adorning its Southern boundaries. And then Adam&#39;s <br />Bridge-<br />  a reef of sunken islands&#39; beckons us across the Palk Straits to <br />  Ceylon, where civilization flourished more than 2000 years <br />  ago....Linga stones may be seen in many places on the highways in <br />my <br />  Presidency. Hindus break upon them the coconuts which they are <br />about <br />  to offer in sacrifice. Usually the phallic ritual is simple and <br />  becoming; it consists in anointing the stone with consecrated <br />water <br />  or oil, and decorating it with leaves. At the Rameshwaram temple, <br />  the Linga stone is daily washed with Ganga water, which is <br />  afterwards sold to the pious, as holy water or mesmerized water <br />has <br />  been sold in Europe. All these are a little part of my beloved <br />  Presidency - indeed my favourite India. Right from the dawn of <br />  history, India is extraordinarily continuous in time. In space, on <br />  the other hand, it is extraordinarily discontinuous. ... from <br />early <br />  times in India, it is ethnology, philology, and archaeology that <br />  give and will give us some notions of the truth. From archaeology <br />  much can be expected. I would earnestly request you to direct the <br />  Archaeological Survey of India &#40;ASI&#41; to undertake an extensive and <br />  intensive survey of Rameshwaram and its beautiful environs, <br />  particularly with reference to the historic and primordial Adam&#39;s <br />  Bridge&#39;. After 93 years and 60 years after our independence, this <br />  very request of Lord Pentland made in 1914 for the conduct of an <br />  intensive and extensive archeological survey of Rameswaram and <br />Ram <br />  Sethu by the ASI , was again reiterated by Dr Subramanian Swamy <br />in <br />  his letter sent to Mrs Ambika Soni, Union Minister for Culture on <br />  March 3, 2007. This known anti-Hindu Christian Minister for <br />Culture <br />  &#40;a political tenant- at Ã¢Â€&quot;will totally at the mercy of Sonia <br />Gandhi!&#41; <br />  treated Dr.Swami&#39;s reasonable request made in the larger public <br />  interest with supreme-Sonia contempt and hatred.<br />  <br />  Sir. Alexander Tottenham I.C.S. <br />  &#40; 1873-1946&#41;<br />  B Dewan of Pudukkottai <br />  &#40;1934-1946&#41;<br />  <br />  I got to know about Lord Pentland&#39;s letter of December 1914 <br />  addressed to Lord Hardinge from my friend Late Shri.K.Nagarajan of <br />  Pudukkottai. He was a great friend of Sir.Alexander Tottenham ICS <br />  who was Dewan of Pudukkotttai from 1934 to 1946. Tottenham passed <br />  away in Pudukkotai on December 13 1946. He lies buried in the <br />  Lutheran Mission Churchyard at Machuvadi in Pudukkottai. As Dewan <br />of <br />  Pudukkottai, Tottenham became a legend as a great public servantÃ¢Â€&quot;a <br />  good man, noble,, just and generous. <br />  Tottenham had given the excerpts from the letter of Lord Pentland <br />  addressed to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India &#40;already referred <br />  to above&#41; to Shri.K.Nagarajan and Shri.K.Nagarajan was good enough <br />  to give me in December 1984, a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham&#39;s <br />  letter dated 6th December 1941 addressed to Shri.K.Nagarajan. This <br />  is a historic letter which speaks for itself. I am giving below a <br />  facsimile of this letter of Sir.Alexander Tottenham dated 6th <br />  December 1941.<br />  <br />  Though Lord Pentland had recommended a Survey of the area in and <br />  around Ram Sethu in December 1914 to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of <br />  India, yet no action was immediately taken by the Government of <br />  India because of the intervention of the I World War Even after <br />the <br />  end of the I World War, nothing was done because the allocation of <br />  funds for archeological work was substantially reduced during the <br />  inter-war period between 1919 to 1939. The political turmoil <br />created <br />  by the rising independence movement in India also contributed to <br />  this process. With the advent of II World War on September 3 1939, <br />  all archeological survey work came to a standstill till 1945. This <br />  position was clearly explained by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Director <br />  General of Archeology in 1946. <br />  <br />  After our Independence, the Congress Government under Nehru <br />  functioned as an Islamic anti-Hindu Government. The assassination <br />of <br />  Mahatma Gandhi on 30th January 1948, only strengthened the hands <br />of <br />  Congress Party to crush the spirit and culture of the Hindus of <br />  India in a systematic manner. Nehru saw to it that the new <br />  Constitution of India gave greater privileges and protection to <br />the <br />  anti-national Muslims of India who had just 1 year earlier in <br />1946 <br />  voted enmasse for Muslim League and Pakistan. In a criminal <br />  fashion, Nehru admitted the very same anti-national Muslim members <br />  into the Congress Party, who had earlier voted for Jinnah and his <br />  Pakistan. This `glorious&#39; anti-Hindu tradition has reached its <br />  climax under UPA Government today. The anti-national Sachar <br />  Committee is an instance in point. Our surrogate Prime Minister is <br />a <br />  disposable pawn in the hands of a woman imposter from Italy who <br />owes <br />  no allegiance to the Indian State or the Indian Constitution. As a <br />  known anti-Hindu Roman Catholic, she is acting as an active agent <br />of <br />  the Pope in Rome whose only programme is to evangelize India by <br />  hook or by crook. Their larger hidden plan is to dismember India. <br />It <br />  is against this background, in these columns I had written as <br />  follows in September 2007: `In my view, Union Shipping Minister TR <br />  Baalu, Union Minister for Culture Ambika Soni, Tamil Nadu Chief <br />  Minister Karunanidhi are all guilty of uttering unabashed <br />falsehoods <br />  when they say in unison, flanked and blessed by non-Hindu and anti-<br />  Hindu Sonia Gandhi: `There is no credible or valid or tenable or <br />  acceptable archeological or scientific evidence about the <br />existence <br />  of Ram Sethu Bridge&#39;. Their deliberate falsehoods, individually <br />or <br />  collectively or severally, dished out in this context, not only <br />come <br />  into fierce conflict with historically established truths but also <br />  raucously &#40;if not `rationally&#39; in the dastardly Dravidian sense!&#41; <br />  quarrel among themselves. Das Munshi, Union Minister for <br />  Parliamentary Affairs, has squarely beaten the virulently anti-<br />Hindu <br />  trio of TR Baalu, Ambika Soni and Karunanidhi by declaring that <br />Ram <br />  Sethu Bridge would not be allowed to be destroyed during the UPA <br />  rule like the Babri Masjid that was demolished when BJP was in <br />power <br />  in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992! More and more original <br />fireworks <br />  of similar diabolic duplicity and wickedness can be expected from <br />  other anti-Hindu and Islam-embracing Union Ministers like Arjun <br />  Singh, Antulay, Mani Shankar Iyer on this very exciting, excitable <br />  and Congress-titillatin g `secular theme&#39; of planned destruction <br />of <br />  Ram Sethu Bridge as an integral part of the Sethusamudram Shipping <br />  Canal Project &#40;SSCP&#41;.&quot;<br />  <br />  K.NAGARAJA IYER &#40;1891-1986&#41;<br />  <br />  <br />  As I mentioned earlier, I am indebted to Shri.K.Nagarajan for his <br />  kindness in giving me a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham&#39;s letter <br />to <br />  me. K.Nagarajan was born on 20th June 1893. His father, Shri <br />  A.G.Krishnaswamy Aiyar, was the Chief of the Pudukkottai State <br />  Police Service. After graduating from Madras Christian College, he <br />  joined the Madras Law College and completed his Bachelor of Law <br />  course. After 2 years of legal practice in Madurai from 1913 to <br />  1915, he settled down as a lawyer in Pudukkottai and continued in <br />  his profession till his 82nd year in 1975. He was also State Vakil <br />  and Public Prosecutor in Pudukkottai State. In 1980, the <br />Department <br />  of Archives of the Tamil Nadu Government, commissioned K.Nagarajan <br />  to write a book on the life of Sir.Alexander Tottenham. He <br />completed <br />  this work and soon thereafter he passed away in the summer of 1986.<br />  <br />  The historian is both discoverer and creator. To the uniqueness of <br />  his role we have a clue in the very word `HISTORY&#39;, which means <br />both <br />  the course of the past and the legible account of the past. The <br />  historian is always trying to reduce or remove, that ambiguity. If <br />  he is successful, he leads his readers to takeÃ¢Â€&quot;or mistakeÃ¢Â€&quot;his <br />  account for what was really there. Thus the historian sets himself <br />a <br />  dangerous, even an impossible, task. That is why, the great Dutch <br />  historian, JH Huizinga used the phrase `A Wrestler with the Angel&#39; <br />  to describe a historian. The historian can rediscover the past <br />only <br />  by the relics it has left for the present. What his imagination is <br />  to the poet, facts are to the historian. His exercise of judgement <br />  comes in their selection, his art in their arrangement. His method <br />  is narrative. His subject is the story of man&#39;s past. His function <br />  is to make it known.<br />  <br />  &#40;concluded&#41;<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />      <br />  <br />  <br />        <br />_____________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>_______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />  know-it-all with Yahoo!

To the uniqueness of his role we have a clue in the very word `HISTORY', which means both the course of the past and the legible account of the past. The historian is always trying to reduce or remove, that ambiguity. If heis successful, he leads his readers to takeâ€”or mistakeâ€”hisaccount for what was really there. Thus the historian sets himself a dangerous, even an impossible, task. That is why, the great Dutch historian, JH Huizinga used the phrase `A Wrestler with the Angel' to describe a historian. The historian can rediscover the past only by the relics it has left for the present. What his imagination is to the poet, facts are to the historian. His exercise of judgement comes in their<br />selection, his art in their arrangement. His method is narrative. His subject is the story of man's past. His function is to make it known.(concluded)<br /><br />Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile. Try it now. <br /><br /><br /> Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage.
