			<div class="content">I am giving below the first para of an article from TOI, 19 aug. I could<br />not find the link from toi website; I will post it when it is made<br />available.<br /><br />What The Gita Says About Free Will And Destiny<br />'Paramarthi Raina'<br /><br />We take for granted that we have the free will to make conscious<br />decisions to choose between different possible courses of action.<br />However, recently conducted experiments in the Max Planck Institute in<br />Germany on the functioning of the human brain, have put that presumption<br />into doubt. The researchers have concluded that free will could, in<br />fact, be "little more than an illusion".<br /><br />The experiments indicated that our subconscious mind decides on and<br />dictates our actions, long before our conscious mind actually realises<br />it.<br /><br />Food for thought!!<br /><br />Sampath<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vinjamoor_venkatesh"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Atpu,<br /> <br />  Just my two cents worth.<br /> <br />  But before that a Caveat: As said earlier, this is based on<br />  philosophies of one particular sect. Does not necessarily mean that<br />  this is the only correct view. It still could be, from a human point<br />  of view but from the all-mercy Almighty&#39;s point of view, there can be<br />  absolutely nothing wrong. For Him, everything is just correct. I will<br />  explain the supporting verses for this caveat later.<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "atpu555" atpu555@ wrote: <br /> <br />    Does this mean that we don&#39;t have any &#39;free will&#39; at all?<br />    If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first<br />  place?<br />   <br />    I thought that when we say &#39;All Thy Will&#39; as all the<br />    Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of<br />  mind to<br />    have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.<br /> <br />  Yes, according to this philosophy, there is absolutely no free will<br />  on part of the Athma. This, is a point of debate between various<br />  sects of Hinduism and even within Srivaishnavism itself. Some say<br />  that the Atma is indeed given a free will first, and based on its<br />  initial action, the good or bad karma starts accumulating for the<br />  Atma. This case is presented, so that one shall not say that the God<br />  is biased when He supposedly blesses some while troubling &#40;I wouldn&#39;t<br />  call it a punishment&#41; others for no mistake of the Atma.<br /> <br />  And some others say that the Athma is absolutely independant and<br />  hence the karma accrues to it according to its deed.<br /> <br />  A Logical Rational Analysis:-<br /> <br />  The people who ascribe a "Free Will" to Atma just to ensure that no<br />  one says anything wrong on the part of the God, forget the fact that<br />  when there is absolutely no one equal to or greater than Him, no<br />  blame accumulate on His part. When He is THE Supreme Being and the<br />  owner of everything, just about everything, then can&#39;t He act the way<br />  He wishes? Why should He be bound by what the mere humans, created by<br />  Him thinks?<br /> <br />  On the other hand, the supporters of "No Free Will" just resign to<br />  the fact that He is the Sarva Swami &#40;Swami-means the absolute owner<br />  of everything&#41; and that we are all willing slaves. No matter whatever<br />  we think about Him, He is what He is. Just think about this. No<br />  matter what a person thinks about it, a Mountain is indeed a<br />  Mountain. Just take case of Brahmaputra river. While we in India call<br />  it as Brahmaputra, the Chinese at it origin call it Yang Tse. Does it<br />  changes the character of the river? Similarly, the God remains unique<br />  in all aspects and He just acts the way He wishes, no matter what His<br />  creatures think of Him. Thinking that He is biased is the limitation<br />  of the Jeevatma. He is definitely not bound by what the Jeeva thinks.<br />  The moment one says that He is bounded by what the Jeevatma thinks of<br />  Him, then immediately the Supremity of the God is put to question as<br />  how can a person, who can be questioned for His acts, be called a<br />  Supreme Being or Brahman.<br /> <br />  And I would never think that the Azhwars and Nayanmars were doing Lip<br />  Service when they said that "It is Him who acts and not them the<br />  mortals". They had absolute faith on this aspect of God and that is<br />  what is the essence of their wonderful pourings.<br /> <br />  Finally as I said in the caveat above, let me give you the supporting<br />  verses which confirm that there is no "one correct" method to reach<br />  the God.<br /> <br />  Nammazhwar says in Thiruviruttham,<br /> <br />  vaNangum thuRigaL pala pala Akki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />  piNangum samayam pala pala Akki, avai avai thORu<br />  aNangum pala pala Akki, nin mUrthy parappi vaithhAi<br />  iNangu innOrai illai, nin <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> vEtkai yezhuvippanE.<br /> <br />  The essence of the above pAsuram is that:- He has created so many<br />  religions and hence so many ways for the Jeevatma to attain Him and<br />  then He is present as the Supreme God in every Religion of the world<br />  and such God is created a non-ending thirst on part of the Azhwar to<br />  reach His lotus feet as soon as possible.<br /> <br />  This is the proof that every religion, sect, subsect et all are just<br />  different routes to attain God.<br /> <br />  And finally, God Himself ensures that all His creations reach Him<br />  back when He wishes. Nammazhwar, again, this time in Thiruvaimozhi,<br />  says, "avar avar vidhi vazhi adaya ninRanarE" in the first decad and<br />  in the penultimate decad says " vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar<br />  vidihyE". This two gives a better understanding of what is Destiny<br />  or "vidhi". That, everyone born in this world are destined to reach<br />  Him and that Destiny is He Himself and His wishes.<br /> <br />  The fact that everyone reaches Him finally is also corroborated by<br />  Thirumangai Azhwar. I have quoted this just two days back<br /> <br />  "manjADu varai yEzhum, vAnagamum maNNagamum, maRRum ellAm<br />  enjAmal vayiRRadakki Alin mEl Or iLam thaLiril <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> vaLarndha eesan"<br /> <br />  So, forgetting the fact that one sect is ascribing to this<br />  philosophy, when one does a logical analysis, then I am sure they<br />  will come to this conclusion.<br /> <br />  In fact this is exactly why I wanted our members to come out with an<br />  answer of what they perceive their Ideal God to possess as.<br /> <br />  I dont know if I was able to satisfy your query. Please let me know<br />  if you need more clarifications on this perspective.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br /> <br /> <br />    I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />    Thank you.<br />   <br />    Atpu.<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vinjamoor_venkatesh"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      Smt Malathi,<br />     <br />      You said: <br />      ==================Quote========================<br />      That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of<br />      those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or<br />      anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great<br />      hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel<br />  things<br />      happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these<br />  are<br />      just some challenges with that approach.<br />      ==================Unquote=======================<br />     <br />      You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people<br />      saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they<br />      encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there<br />  are<br />      indeed some who even stop believing in His existence.<br />     <br />      But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism<br />  Philosophy<br />      perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief<br />  on<br />      Him, is done by Him only.<br />     <br />      Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhaviruttham says,<br />     <br />      naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai,<br />      vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl,<br />  aRindhanan<br />      nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE<br />     <br />      Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of<br />      giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable<br />  of<br />      taking it back. So please do not do that&#40;taking away your<br />  thoughts&#41;<br />      to me. I know you!!!<br />     <br />      Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and<br />      anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is<br />  the<br />      sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.<br />     <br />      The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs<br />  that<br />      I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE<br />      kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".<br />     <br />      Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be<br />  so<br />      merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as<br />  the<br />      Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there<br />  would<br />      be no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind about what He can do, considering<br />  the<br />      Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.<br />     <br />      This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences<br />      between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to<br />      Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by<br />      different names.

			<div class="content">I am no philoshpical expert but a practical two cents -<br />Free will is not an illusion. It is limited than what we think that is all.Just having choices does not mean person can make them. It depends on yourbackground, psychological mindset, and several factors to be able to make a choice. <br />Â <br />I don't remember who said it but someone I read - It is more dangerous to believe you dont' have a choice than it is to actually not have a choice. Inother words human confidence is based on the assumption that we have a free will or choice. If we negate that completely eeryone will be wimpy slavesof some power most people dont' really know. Only very few people are confident slaves, sages and saints of great spiritual maturity.<br /><br /><br />--- On Sat, 8/23/08, S Sampath  wrote: <br /><br />From: S Sampath <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Saturday, August 23, 2008, 8:28 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I am giving below the first para of an article from TOI, 19 aug. I could not find the link from toi website; I will post it when it is made available.<br /><br />What The Gita Says About Free Will And Destiny<br />'Paramarthi Raina'<br /><br />We take for granted that we have the free will to make conscious decisions to choose between different possible courses of action. However, recently conducted experiments in the Max Planck Institute in Germany on the functioning of the human brain, have put that presumption into doubt. The researchers have concluded that free will could, in fact, be "little more than an illusion".<br /><br />The experiments indicated that our subconscious mind decides on and dictates our actions, long before our conscious mind actually realises it.<br /><br />Food for thought!!<br /><br />Sampath<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vinjamoor_venkates h"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Atpu,<br />  <br />  Just my two cents worth.<br />  <br />  But before that a Caveat: As said earlier, this is based on <br />  philosophies of one particular sect. Does not necessarily mean that <br />  this is the only correct view. It still could be, from a human point <br />  of view but from the all-mercy Almighty&#39;s point of view, there can be <br />  absolutely nothing wrong. For Him, everything is just correct. I will <br />  explain the supporting verses for this caveat later.<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "atpu555" atpu555@ wrote: <br />  <br />    Does this mean that we don&#39;t have any &#39;free will&#39; at all?<br />    If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first <br />  place?<br />    <br />    I thought that when we say &#39;All Thy Will&#39; as all the <br />    Thevaaram/Thiruvaas agam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of <br />  mind to <br />    have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.<br />  <br />  Yes, according to this philosophy, there is absolutely no free will <br />  on part of the Athma. This, is a point of debate between various <br />  sects of Hinduism and even within Srivaishnavism itself. Some say <br />  that the Atma is indeed given a free will first, and based on its <br />  initial action, the good or bad karma starts accumulating for the <br />  Atma. This case is presented, so that one shall not say that the God <br />  is biased when He supposedly blesses some while troubling &#40;I wouldn&#39;t <br />  call it a punishment&#41; others for no mistake of the Atma.<br />  <br />  And some others say that the Athma is absolutely independant and <br />  hence the karma accrues to it according to its deed.<br />  <br />  A Logical Rational Analysis:- <br />  <br />  The people who ascribe a "Free Will" to Atma just to ensure that no <br />  one says anything wrong on the part of the God, forget the fact that <br />  when there is absolutely no one equal to or greater than Him, no <br />  blame accumulate on His part. When He is THE Supreme Being and the <br />  owner of everything, just about everything, then can&#39;t He act the way <br />  He wishes? Why should He be bound by what the mere humans, created by <br />  Him thinks? <br />  <br />  On the other hand, the supporters of "No Free Will" just resign to <br />  the fact that He is the Sarva Swami &#40;Swami-means the absolute owner <br />  of everything&#41; and that we are all willing slaves. No matter whatever <br />  we think about Him, He is what He is. Just think about this. No <br />  matter what a person thinks about it, a Mountain is indeed a <br />  Mountain. Just take case of Brahmaputra river. While we in India call <br />  it as Brahmaputra, the Chinese at it origin call it Yang Tse. Does it <br />  changes the character of the river? Similarly, the God remains unique <br />  in all aspects and He just acts the way He wishes, no matter what His <br />  creatures think of Him. Thinking that He is biased is the limitation <br />  of the Jeevatma. He is definitely not bound by what the Jeeva thinks. <br />  The moment one says that He is bounded by what the Jeevatma thinks of <br />  Him, then immediately the Supremity of the God is put to question as <br />  how can a person, who can be questioned for His acts, be called a <br />  Supreme Being or Brahman.<br />  <br />  And I would never think that the Azhwars and Nayanmars were doing Lip <br />  Service when they said that "It is Him who acts and not them the <br />  mortals". They had absolute faith on this aspect of God and that is <br />  what is the essence of their wonderful pourings.<br />  <br />  Finally as I said in the caveat above, let me give you the supporting <br />  verses which confirm that there is no "one correct" method to reach <br />  the God. <br />  <br />  Nammazhwar says in Thiruviruttham,<br />  <br />  vaNangum thuRigaL pala pala Akki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />  piNangum samayam pala pala Akki, avai avai thORu<br />  aNangum pala pala Akki, nin mUrthy parappi vaithhAi<br />  iNangu innOrai illai, nin <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> vEtkai yezhuvippanE.<br />  <br />  The essence of the above pAsuram is that:- He has created so many <br />  religions and hence so many ways for the Jeevatma to attain Him and <br />  then He is present as the Supreme God in every Religion of the world <br />  and such God is created a non-ending thirst on part of the Azhwar to <br />  reach His lotus feet as soon as possible.<br />  <br />  This is the proof that every religion, sect, subsect et all are just <br />  different routes to attain God. <br />  <br />  And finally, God Himself ensures that all His creations reach Him <br />  back when He wishes. Nammazhwar, again, this time in Thiruvaimozhi, <br />  says, "avar avar vidhi vazhi adaya ninRanarE" in the first decad and <br />  in the penultimate decad says " vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar <br />  vidihyE". This two gives a better understanding of what is Destiny <br />  or "vidhi". That, everyone born in this world are destined to reach <br />  Him and that Destiny is He Himself and His wishes.<br />  <br />  The fact that everyone reaches Him finally is also corroborated by <br />  Thirumangai Azhwar. I have quoted this just two days back<br />  <br />  "manjADu varai yEzhum, vAnagamum maNNagamum, maRRum ellAm<br />  enjAmal vayiRRadakki Alin mEl Or iLam thaLiril <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> vaLarndha eesan"<br />  <br />  So, forgetting the fact that one sect is ascribing to this <br />  philosophy, when one does a logical analysis, then I am sure they <br />  will come to this conclusion.<br />  <br />  In fact this is exactly why I wanted our members to come out with an <br />  answer of what they perceive their Ideal God to possess as. <br />  <br />  I dont know if I was able to satisfy your query. Please let me know <br />  if you need more clarifications on this perspective.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  <br />    I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />    Thank you.<br />    <br />    Atpu.<br />    <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vinjamoor_venkates h" <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      Smt Malathi,<br />      <br />      You said: <br />      ============ ======Quote= ========= ========= =====<br />      That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />      those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />      anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />      hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel <br />  things <br />      happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these <br />  are <br />      just some challenges with that approach.<br />      ============ ======Unquote= ========= ========= ====<br />      <br />      You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />      saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />      encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there <br />  are <br />      indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. <br />      <br />      But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism <br />  Philosophy <br />      perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief <br />  on <br />      Him, is done by Him only. <br />      <br />      Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhavirutth am says,<br />      <br />      naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />      vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, <br />  aRindhanan <br />      nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE<br />      <br />      Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />      giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable <br />  of <br />      taking it back. So please do not do that&#40;taking away your <br />  thoughts&#41; <br />      to me. I know you!!! <br />      <br />      Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />      anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is <br />  the <br />      sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.<br />      <br />      The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs <br />  that <br />      I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu.. ." and "kaNNanE <br />      kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".<br />      <br />      Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be <br />  so <br />      merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as <br />  the <br />      Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there <br />  would <br />      be no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind about what He can do, considering <br />  the <br />      Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.<br />      <br />      This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />      between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />      Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />      different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />      visualisation of the Form &#40;I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means <br />  Vishnu <br />      and Maan-Mazhu means Siva&#41; when one tries to fit the God in the <br />      above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then <br />  Siva <br />      and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. <br />      <br />      This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,<br />      <br />      thAzh sadaiyum &#40;Siva&#41; nIL mudiyum &#40;Vishnu&#41; oN mazhuvum &#40;Siva&#41; <br />      chakkaramum &#40;Vishnu&#41; sUzh aravum &#40;Siva&#41; pon nANum &#40;Vishnu&#41; <br />  thOndRum <br />      mAL.

Only <br />when we realize that we do not control anything, right from the air <br />we breathe to the action that happens, we must resign ourselves to <br />the fact that the I has never been there in the first place and we <br />are holding on to something that is never been there, hence we have <br />been cast out from our real space with the eternity. <br /><br />This 'I' here is totally not related or combined with the sentence 'I <br />am ravi or I am satish' - that I is physical, very much there. <br /><br />The I here is above the physical concept, it is attached to the mind <br />and action or thought....<br /><br />Romba kozappiteno <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />-- R<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I am no expert like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>, Ravi et al.<br />  <br />  Just trying to put forth what I understand.<br />  <br />  The first step of bondage of the self is to think that we are not<br />  free. The atman is free and till we recognize it we are caught in <br />the<br />  samsara sagaram. This is because we attribute every action to &#39;I&#39;,<br />  thinking that I am doing this, I am doing that. This &#39;I&#39; is the <br />cause<br />  of Karma. Once we relinquish this &#39;I&#39; and do our duty, then we are <br />not<br />  bound by karma. Very difficult to realize and attain this and trying<br />  to do things without expecting results is the first step of <br />karmayoga.<br />  <br />  Easiest way is bakthi yoga, where we surrender to the God saying<br />  everything is yours, whatever I do is because of you. When we come <br />to<br />  this state,as <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> referred as &#39;willing slaves&#39;, then we dont take<br />  responsibility of our actions, and slowly the &#39;I&#39; in us will be<br />  dissolved and we can be free. Till then, yes, there is no free will<br />  but the struggle of life is only to be free.<br />  <br />  There is nothing called wrong or right in this world.

			<div class="content"><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>, There are research books written extensively on origins and interpolations in both Ramayana and Mahabharat. IÂ  have not read any on Mahabharat but the Ramayana there is a very good book written by Paula Richman, Many Ramayanas - where she talks of significant gaps in the story that appear to be material dropped, and changes in style of writing that do not appear likethe same author. She says a big gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile and why Sri Rama did not seek his brother's help instead of travelling south to Lanka alone. We have to know sanskrit prety well to look into changes in writing but it appears like very possible that the Ramayana after Sita's kidnapping may have been authored by someone else.<br />Â <br />I agree with Satish's point that the Mahabharat appears very close knit to assume anything happened with the original. But 'vaai vazhi kadhai' will have gaps all the time. Even two discourses on the same original are not the same. <br />Â <br />Learning scripture by heart is fine, I agree. I learnt lot of things like that,Â all the suprabhats, sahasranaas and various slokas. Â Mahabharat isnot a scripture to be learnt that way and from what I know it is even forbidden to read it at home.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br />--- On Sat, 8/23/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  wrote: <br /><br />From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Saturday, August 23, 2008, 5:10 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sathish,<br /><br />Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it (Kanchi Periyava's <br />stance) too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for by-<br />hearting.<br /><br />I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 days, <br />just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day onwards, <br />he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if we <br />keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and even <br />if we do so we will forget it soon. <br /><br />Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />closed for the next 10-12 days. <br /><br />One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />personally I would say that, they were more conservative and there <br />would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new ideas. <br />Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything new <br />that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />those days it would have been more.<br /><br />I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is very <br />much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.<br /><br />Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that would <br />have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like you, <br />that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But at <br />the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened in <br />the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by the <br />Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking the <br />bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from the "urai" <br />pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself and <br />yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many Tamizh <br />scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy but <br />atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no controversy <br />and the project was itself in the godown.<br /><br />So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity & honesty of the <br />Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the last <br />millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during the <br />times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />presume it could not have happened. <br /><br />But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's statement) <br />are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have ample <br />proofs.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came to<br />  India and started documenting everything, the mode of education in<br />  India was by sishya parampara. Guru teaches the sishya, sishya has <br />to<br />  memorize it, upside down,downside up and what not. In veda&#39;s we call<br />  it gana padam.....repeating everything in the reverse order. Even<br />  today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathul a ezhupi ketalum <br />theriyanum.<br />  <br />  That was the quality of education we had and if that was the case,<br />  just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years where <br />the<br />  human mind would have been more clear to remember things.

If there is no documents, we will strive to<br />  remember, if we have a book, we will lazy thinking, ok i have the<br />  book, I can refer to it anytime, but we will never refer.

As I understand whatever we have now is the<br />  record of Vaishampayana&#39; s narration, not Vyasa&#39;s original. There <br />fore<br />  3 degrees of narration within the same epic it is wholly possible<br />  things were left out, added and so on.</div></blockquote></div>

In fact I have heard it &#40;Kanchi Periyava&#39;s <br />  stance&#41; too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />  Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for by-<br />  hearting.<br />  <br />  I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars&#39; <br />  Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 days, <br />  just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day onwards, <br />  he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if we <br />  keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and <br />even <br />  if we do so we will forget it soon. <br />  <br />  Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />  closed for the next 10-12 days. <br />  <br />  One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />  personally I would say that, they were more conservative and there <br />  would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new ideas. <br />  Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything new <br />  that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />  those days it would have been more.<br />  <br />  I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is very <br />  much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />  supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />  when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />  considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.<br />  <br />  Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />  resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that would <br />  have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like <br />you, <br />  that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But at <br />  the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened in <br />  the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by <br />the <br />  Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking <br />the <br />  bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />  supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from the "urai" <br />  pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself and <br />  yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />  statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many Tamizh <br />  scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />  idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy but <br />  atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no <br />controversy <br />  and the project was itself in the godown.<br />  <br />  So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity & honesty of the <br />  Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />  back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the last <br />  millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during <br />the <br />  times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />  presume it could not have happened. <br />  <br />  But all that we say &#40;either Your statement or Malathi&#39;s statement&#41; <br />  are only "possibilities" and we can&#39;t conclude until we have ample <br />  proofs.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Thats where we differ from our ancestors.

			<div class="content">Ravi, I agree with you that all versions are same conceptually. The storyline which is a manifestation of the concept is not that way, yes it is a vision but how do we know the vision was passed down or even interpreted correctly by followers? There are Ramayanas world over by the way, not just in India. Some of them are very offensive to indian sentimens such as Rama and Sita being siblings, or Sita Ravana&#39;s daughter and so on.

They even quoted <br />     supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from <br />  the "urai" <br />     pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself <br />  and <br />     yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />     statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many <br />  Tamizh <br />     scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />     idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy <br />  but <br />     atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no <br />   controversy <br />     and the project was itself in the godown. <br />     <br />     So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity & honesty of <br />  the <br />     Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />     back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the <br />  last <br />     millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during <br />   the <br />     times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />     presume it could not have happened. <br />     <br />     But all that we say &#40;either Your statement or Malathi&#39;s <br />  statement&#41; <br />     are only "possibilities" and we can&#39;t conclude until we have <br />  ample <br />     proofs. <br />     <br />     Regards, <br />     Venkatesh <br />     <br />     <br />     --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar <br />  Arunachalam" <br />      wrote: <br />       <br />       Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came <br />  to <br />       India and started documenting everything, the mode of education <br />  in <br />       India was by sishya parampara. Guru teaches the sishya, sishya <br />   has <br />     to <br />       memorize it, upside down,downside up and what not. In veda&#39;s we <br />   call <br />       it gana padam.....repeating everything in the reverse order. <br />  Even <br />       today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathul a ezhupi ketalum <br />     theriyanum. <br />       <br />       That was the quality of education we had and if that was the <br />  case, <br />       just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years <br />  where <br />     the <br />       human mind would have been more clear to remember things. So 3 <br />     degrees <br />       of narration and errors...I dont think that crept in....then we <br />     would <br />       have lost almost all the veda&#39;s and upanishads by now. <br />       <br />       Kanchi mahaperiyaval says that,we started forgeting things only <br />     after <br />       documenting them. If there is no documents, we will strive to <br />       remember, if we have a book, we will lazy thinking, ok i have <br />  the <br />       book, I can refer to it anytime, but we will never refer. Thats <br />   why <br />       the people who knew sanskrit and veda&#39;s have come down <br />   drastically <br />     in <br />       just a century, whereas our forefathers have preserved for eons <br />     together. <br />       <br />       Regards, <br />       Satish <br />       <br />       --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br />    <br />       wrote: <br />         <br />         Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was <br />  related <br />   by <br />       his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna&#39;s grandson Janamejaya in <br />  the <br />       great &#39;sarpa yagna&#39;. As I understand whatever we have now is the <br />       record of Vaishampayana&#39; s narration, not Vyasa&#39;s original. <br />  There <br />     fore <br />       3 degrees of narration within the same epic it is wholly <br />  possible <br />       things were left out, added and so on.</div></blockquote></div>
