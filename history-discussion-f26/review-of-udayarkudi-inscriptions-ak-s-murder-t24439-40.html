			<div class="content">Hi all<br /><br /><br />antha naal niyaabakam.......<br /><br />a literal flood of knowledgable mails.<br /><br />I would like to express my views too.<br /><br />first of all we should be able to seperate and see the attributes of a <br />king.<br />if building temples is the only criterion for a good king uthama was <br />better off than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. a shaivaite revivalism happened during his times.<br />the other face of the cholas was made visible to history during his <br />rule.<br /><br />I still beleive the pandyas were responsible for aaditya karikalans <br />murder. they avenged the atrocities of AK ( not arun krishnan) in <br />sevuur.<br />but for a common enemy , the remaining cholas would not have been <br />united thereafter.just imagine the scenario <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> spurning the throne <br />and the same deed repeated by uthama's son 14 years later.<br /><br /><br />in case uthama was the culprit ,just a thought. would we term the <br />pandavas of mahabaratha as murderors for killing their cousins? they <br />were trying to get their throne back( though it righfully belonged to <br />the kauravas) similarly uthama as a kshatriya was allowed to get back <br />his rightful throne by any means.<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All,<br />  <br />  wow.. quite a lot of mails <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> Looks like I really set the cat <br />amongst the<br />  pigeons here!<br />  <br />  Dear SPS,<br />  <br />  I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue &#40;or that I <br />had made<br />  it so &#41; is <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym> fallacious. It doesn&#39;t matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> built the <br />Periya<br />  Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of <br />worship<br />  I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many <br />kalanjiams of<br />  gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous <br />politicians<br />  visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis,<br />  Tirupathi&#39;s lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn&#39;t <br />happened.<br />  Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> might not <br />have<br />  been as innocent as one is assured that he was &#40;on what basis one <br />does not<br />  know&#41; does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of<br />  building the Periya Kovil.<br />  <br />  Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was completely <br />dominated by<br />  Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. <br />However, with<br />  age comes maturity &#40;and wisdom hopefully&#41;. Or perhaps he turned to <br />religion<br />  later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is <br />usual human<br />  nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the <br />things we<br />  did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had a<br />  change of heart later...<br />  <br />  However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, I believe Kundavai&#39;s role needs to be delved <br />into...<br />  <br />  As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK&#39;s death to <br />reclaim<br />  the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and <br />Kundavai<br />  assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>gone, the throne would automatically come to <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> ..<br />  Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like<br />  Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective <br />weights<br />  behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with <br />intrigue<br />  with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the<br />  Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years <br />leaving<br />  the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately <br />make the<br />  move on the throne.<br />  <br />  All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if <br />anyone<br />  wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of<br />  suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a <br />suspect<br />  and then go on from there eliminating people one by one.<br />  <br />  Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was such a vile <br />person that<br />  his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so <br />Kundavai/RRC<br />  had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>actually "imprisoned" the King in <br />the pon<br />  maaligai. <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> How about that?<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  <br />  Arun<br />  <br />  On 6/15/06, Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi All,<br />   <br />    Think of another conspiracy theory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> being able to control <br />Uthama<br />    chola for 16 long years&#40;an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia&#41;.. <br />then one<br />    day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the <br />consitution<br />    itself.. <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" /><br />   <br />    just kidding.. another line of thought..<br />   <br />    Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to <br />believe what<br />    they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the <br />greatness of<br />    colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the <br />land and<br />    our cultures for thousands of years...<br />   <br />    Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of <br />KALKI..

He had gone<br />            through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />        and opined. He has<br />            been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />        met and spent some<br />            time on this subject.<br />           <br />            FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />        this subject from the<br />            angle of investigating agency which has<br />        specialised in Poltical<br />            assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />        invested 3 -4<br />            years of hard work in going into several<br />        inscriptions, write ups,<br />            books and other sources apart from personal<br />        interviews with<br />            acknowledged Scholars on this subject.<br />           <br />            With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />        Udayarkudi<br />            inscriptions and certain details evolved :<br />           <br />            1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji&#39;s murder<br />        & AK&#39;s murder.<br />            2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />            Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />        / other reasons..?<br />            How : ??<br />            WHO :: ??<br />            3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />        on the above ..<br />            reviewed..<br />            4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..<br />           <br />            Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />        insctiptions a decade<br />            back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />        UTHAMA has a hand in<br />            the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />        been disturbing me.<br />           <br />            This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />        another angle::<br />           <br />            The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja&#39;s<br />        SAFETY till he<br />            ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />        mechanism to wipe of<br />            <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />        could not be Drohin.<br />           <br />            Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />        CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />            place during Uthama&#39;s tenure..<br />           <br />            If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />        under cloud..<br />           <br />            Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />        Sundara or Uthama?<br />            Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />        in Pandya Kingdom?<br />           <br />            But when certain matters were subjected under<br />        scrutiny, the opinion<br />            is still swinging ..<br />           <br />            It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />        I have agreed to<br />            provide certain materials for his expert review.<br />           <br />            Will report more in due course. sps<br />           <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />       <br />     <br />      __________________________________________________<br />      Do You Yahoo!?<br />      Tired of spam?

			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />Lets revisit the facts again. Why do people believe it was Uthama?<br /><br />the facts as we know them. If I have missed some please correct me:<br /><br />a) Aditya Karikalan kills Pandiyan king and displays his severed head at<br />fort wall<br />b) Aditya Karikalan gets murdered.<br />c) Uthama gets the throne after Sundara Chozhar<br />d) <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> gets the throne after Uthama and not Uthama's son<br />e) After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> attains throne, Ravidasan and co (referred to as Drohin) are<br />banished from Chozha Nadu<br /><br />With just these facts in hand, I find it very difficult to pin blame one way<br />or the other. Circumstantial evidence might enable us to say, as Kalki did<br />that Uthama might have been involved and hence was deposed. The other idea<br />could be the Pandiyan angle. Although again, displaying severed heads of<br />enemy kings at the fort was something that was done fairly regularly in<br />those days. I belive that the evidence is rather flimsy either which way.<br />Were Ravidasan and co ever mentioned in connection with the murder of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>in<br />the kalvettu? Or only as Drohins? If only as Drohins, that might have been<br />for just revealing secrets of state to the enemy. Remember that we associate<br />Ravidasan and Co with AK's murder purely based on Kalki's book I think. (If<br />I am mistaken and there indeed is some mention of Ravidasan and co in<br />connection with AK's murder in some kalvettu, please correct me).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br />On 6/17/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Poornima Sai<br /> <br />  Nandini is fiction. mathuranthakan is not. in actuality<br />  mathuranthakan became uthama. but kalki was a great fan of alexander<br />  dumas I guess and like him has a emperor growing up amongst the common<br />  man.<br /> <br />  so he created a charecter called senthan amuthan who becomes uthama<br />  sola.<br />  amutha and uthama are anagrams.<br /> <br />  mandakini is fiction too. but most people do not realise that one<br />  ordinary charecter in the novel is responsible for may twists in the<br />  story<br /> <br />  he is karuthiman alias kariya thirumal.<br /> <br />  he saves mandakini from drowning, he saves uthama from beiung buried<br />  alive as a baby, he reveals to sendan his secret of his birth. he<br />  brings back mathuranthakan to the pandyas and so on.<br /> <br />  the genius of kalki was that he could give so much importance to such<br />  an ordinary charecter.<br /> <br />  pungkuzhali is also a wonderful piece of fiction. the name of the<br />  goddess in a very ancient temple adjacent to kalki&#39;s village is called<br />  vandamar punkuzhali.<br />  perhaps he chose that name because of this.<br /> <br />  regards<br />  venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Hi Venkatesh,<br />First, you can call me Poornima, cut the Sai.<br /><br />Two, thanks for that. Karuthiruman should also have been fictious. True, he was 'the one' who played a major role..<br /><br />Clear this one for me... this is from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> ...<br /><br />Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That has not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani gave birth to twins in Sembiyan Madevi's palace and that the replacement happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. But it is also said When the pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar happened,Kandarathitha chozhar's son(madurantakan) was one year old. I think only because of that reason the guards went searching for Sundara Chozhar in the first place. And only during the pattabhishekam , Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house and then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think that is confusing?

			<div class="content">Hi Poornima,<br />Kalki was genius. no doubt about that.<br />but he was also handicapped by the fact that he had to write one <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> <br />every week. he was comitting himself in print with no opportunity to <br />correct himself if he was found to be wrong.<br /><br />in this group we ran a discussion a year back on the errors of kalki.<br /><br />this particular chronology of events was discussed and I remember <br />swetha came out with some conclusions based on the ages of the <br />charecters.<br />you are right .<br />sendan amudan just does not fit into the chronology, because he could <br />have even been born on the same day as nandini.<br />also in one paragraph nandini's identity ( as daughter/ wife of ) was <br />also confused by kalki.<br /><br />so I suggest lets cut out the research and enjoy kalki's story <br />telling.<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br /><br />Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by karuthirumman <br />and when she was rescued, she was pregnant.

			<div class="content">Dear Arun<br />nice thread nice logic ...<br />Ravidasan et al were punished by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and it is found in the Udayarudi Inscriptions<br />Having not read the inscriptions myself but it is referenced in so many places So Ravidasan was not part of Kalkis imagination<br /><br />So it is based on inscriptional evidence and we have discussed about the punishment taht was meted as well he did not kill them but excommunicated them and send them out of the country...<br /><br />I know G will have some answers but is keeping mum because that would be a crux of his Seramaan Kottai<br /><br />Regards<br />Sri<br /><br /><br />Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br />Dear All,<br /><br />Lets revisit the facts again. Why do people believe it was Uthama?<br /><br />the facts as we know them. If I have missed some please correct me:<br /><br />a) Aditya Karikalan kills Pandiyan king and displays his severed head at fort wall<br />b) Aditya Karikalan gets murdered.<br />c) Uthama gets the throne after Sundara Chozhar<br />d) <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> gets the throne after Uthama and not Uthama's son<br />e) After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> attains throne, Ravidasan and co (referred to as Drohin) are banished from Chozha Nadu<br /><br />With just these facts in hand, I find it very difficult to pin blame one way or the other. Circumstantial evidence might enable us to say, as Kalki did that Uthama might have been involved and hence was deposed. The other idea could be the Pandiyan angle. Although again, displaying severed heads of enemy kings at the fort was something that was done fairly regularly in those days. I belive that the evidence is rather flimsy either which way. Were Ravidasan and co ever mentioned in connection with the murder of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>in the kalvettu? Or only as Drohins? If only as Drohins, that might have been for just revealing secrets of state to the enemy. Remember that we associate Ravidasan and Co with AK's murder purely based on Kalki's book I think. (If I am mistaken and there indeed is some mention of Ravidasan and co in connection with AK's murder in some kalvettu, please correct me).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br />On 6/17/06, R.venketesh  wrote: Hi Poornima Sai<br /><br />Nandini is fiction. mathuranthakan is not. in actuality<br />mathuranthakan became uthama. but kalki was a great fan of alexander<br />dumas I guess and like him has a emperor growing up amongst the common<br />man.<br /><br />so he created a charecter called senthan amuthan who becomes uthama<br />sola.<br />amutha and uthama are anagrams.<br /><br />mandakini is fiction too. but most people do not realise that one<br />ordinary charecter in the novel is responsible for may twists in the<br />story<br /><br />he is karuthiman alias kariya thirumal.<br /><br />he saves mandakini from drowning, he saves uthama from beiung buried<br />alive as a baby, he reveals to sendan his secret of his birth. he<br />brings back mathuranthakan to the pandyas and so on.<br /><br />the genius of kalki was that he could give so much importance to such<br />an ordinary charecter.<br /><br />pungkuzhali is also a wonderful piece of fiction. the name of the<br />goddess in a very ancient temple adjacent to kalki's village is called<br />vandamar punkuzhali.<br />perhaps he chose that name because of this.<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />All new Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Wow...a gush of mail flows after a long time in this group. And <br />great to see that many new people have joined the discussion. <br />Welcome to all first timers <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> and welcome to one of the long lost <br />face in the group welcome swetha...<br />I was not able to follow even the thread of mails due to work and <br />though compelled to write, did not find time.<br />Kundavai and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> conspiring against AK...quite possible. I think <br />almost all postultes have been discussed before, but every one <br />questions the 16 year wait of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. <br />Let me try to explain that..All would accept that though it was <br />Monarchy, earlier kings had a semi democracy as well. the king <br />makers or the sitrarasars, the traders community etc. should support<br />whoever ascends the throne. Sabayom, oorom etc. Sundara chola was <br />very much alive when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered. Since he would have felt that <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was too young to ascend throne, he would have given it to <br />Uthama, who in actual is the legal hier. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> who would have thought <br />that if not <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>he should have been the king, shocked and unable to <br />go against his father, kept quite. sundara's supporters who were <br />loyal to him, supported Uthama. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> who already cleared off AK, <br />would have been a threat to Uthama and hence uthamas period of 16 <br />years didnt see any major uproars in terms of wars or any great <br />things. Though outwardly it seemed peaceful, Uthama would have lived <br />in constant fear of his life. 16 years is more than enough to gather <br />support by hook or crook, which <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> accomplished. Then continuing <br />the threat, he asked Uthama to quit and ascended the throne. Later <br />thinking that Uthamas son can be a threat to him or his son, he <br />cleared him off too. <br />Tiruvalangadu Cheppedu, which says <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> sacrificed the throne, <br />hehe..sonia gandhi is also claimed to have sacrificed the throne, <br />but in actual she announced that MMS will be PM after a 40 min <br />discussion with the president. In just 40 mins if a person can <br />become a tyaga chemmal, 16 years is more than enough to say anything.<br />SPS argument of a such a ruthless <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> constructing big temple...why <br />not? Ashoka killed 8(?) of his brothers to ascend the throne. He was <br />ruthless but changed overnight and spearheaded the spread of <br />Buddhism in India and abroad. nathigam pesinavangale manja thuni <br />potutanga..appuram enna sir...<br />Anyway, all are hypothesis and no one can prove anyone right or <br />wrong. Good discussion. edho ennala mudinchadhu. en pangukku koncham <br />olarittu poren.<br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All,<br />  <br />  Lets revisit the facts again.
