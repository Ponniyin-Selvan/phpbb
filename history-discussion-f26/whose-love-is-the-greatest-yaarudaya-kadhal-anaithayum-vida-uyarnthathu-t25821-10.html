While reading I felt all through the<br />  novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />     <br />  Poonguzhali&#39;s towards Arulmozhi: I didn&#39;t feel like<br />  poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />  of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />     <br />  Nandhini&#39;s towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />  selfish love. When she knows that she won&#39;t be able to<br />  get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />  "You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />  about!!!!"<br />     <br />  Vanadhi&#39;s towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai&#39;s towards<br />  VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />     <br />  Generally positions and throne and all won&#39;t matter<br />  much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />  beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />  pattamagishi or not, it wudn&#39;t impact much since<br />  anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />  that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />  Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />     <br />  Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini&#39;s is<br />  selfless and great. But still eventhough she hadn&#39;t<br />  been living with Sundara Chola throughout her lifetime<br />  atleast she had been with him for somedays, loved him<br />  and been loved by him. For that love, she cud have<br />  sacrificed and saved Sudara and his son.<br />     <br />  But in case of Manimegalai, she has been really<br />  selfless to sacrifice even her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> not knowing<br />  for sure whether he loves her or not..<br />     <br />  Manimegalai tops the rating!!!!!!!!!!<br />     <br />  Cheers, <br />  Sathya<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />  sridhar rathinam  <br />  Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 12:44 am<br />  Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />  Thanks Ram and Sathya..<br />     <br />  That was interesting..i agree with you..Manthagini and <br />Manimegalai in that order.Manthagini inspite of her being wronged</div></blockquote>still does everything for her beloved..Kalki really potrays her true <br />love so well...especially in the scenes where she dots around Arun <br />mozhi varman.....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>No wonder they immortalised her by making her a Goddess even <br />today there is a Temple for the SingalaNachi Amman in Thanjavur OFF</div></blockquote>Medical College road which allegedly was built for Mandhakini by <br />Arunmozhi....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Manimegalai had all the sweet innocence and sacrifices everything <br />for her love..well whether manimegalai would have loved Vandhiyadevan</div></blockquote>inspite of his betrayal...Mm well she knows he didnt love her and <br />used her with his seettalk to get near Karikalan she forgives him and <br />loves him so I m sure She would have done the same...True love always <br />does it.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Nandhini...well did she really love one person atleast <br />truely...that&#39;s the question which Kalki leaves us with..but she</div></blockquote>constantly does keep reminding Karikalan of her love..even before his <br />death..<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Kunthavai..the potrayal of her charecter is so high that she <br />never reveals her love or mental urmaoil..Infact in the whole series</div></blockquote>there would be tears in her eyes only on a few occasions...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vanathi what starts as an innocent love later becomes <br />mature....she even dares to attain gajendra motcham for Arunmozhi..<br />     <br />  Pongulali...well it aws just a sort of Infactuation...crush sort <br />of thing..<br />     <br />  The importnat tHing about Kalki is people and their attitute <br />changes from Time to ..I found it hard to beleive as normal when I</div></blockquote>first read it in sixth standard(and hve read it almost every year <br />during the final exams a great stress releiver) but as I have grown <br />older..

But as a princess, she has to <br />be. When taking<br />  kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of things. A <br />princess of a<br />  big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, actually,<br />  falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you <br />look at the<br />  way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and helps the <br />love to grow<br />  between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she wanted to <br />be in Chozha<br />  nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn&#39;t<br />  have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />bagam if I am<br />  right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything else in her <br />life. She<br />  knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and for that <br />what she can<br />  expect in return. She is pretty clear. <br />     <br />  * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />     <br />  She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have <br />to keep that in<br />  mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and she <br />takes a wow that<br />  she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As Ram <br />aptly puts it,<br />  the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />  harping that she loves AM to be his pm. <br />     <br />  * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />     <br />  As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in <br />love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />  from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she loves her <br />brother so<br />  much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her brother&#41; has <br />been<br />  instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, its because <br />she<br />  realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is <br />wrong that she<br />  goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation where <br />she loves this<br />  guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a <br />conflicting version and<br />  then she realizes something else. And in the end, everything<br />  goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />fate that<br />  plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with the <br />love she has for<br />  <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to her <br />brother, I doubt<br />  she would have acted the way she did. That&#39;s not in her <br />character. <br />     <br />  * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />     <br />  Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example <br />of leaf who<br />  is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants as and <br />when she wants to<br />  just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I doubt if she <br />herself knows<br />  what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is power. In<br />  the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />seeing how strong<br />  his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. <br />But in the end<br />  she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat elsewhere. But she <br />did have a<br />  lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />  again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />including Ravidasan. <br />     <br />  * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />     <br />  She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost <br />his way. So all<br />  she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s another <br />love at first<br />  sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy from a <br />bear. She is an<br />  exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />  around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />disappointment in<br />  life. But her love for one man in her life is predominant above <br />everything<br />  else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She keeps <br />roaming around SC<br />  and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />  time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life <br />in the process<br />  of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary character who <br />cant be compared<br />  to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her love with <br />anyone&#39;s for as<br />  I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life was<br />  dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. <br />     <br />  * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />     <br />  This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She <br />realized that there<br />  was no point in going ahead with something that would never get <br />fulfilled.<br />  Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the love <br />that Sendhan<br />  Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise decision both <br />for<br />  herself and for AM. <br />     <br />     <br />  Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would <br />say it was<br />  Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And she <br />died in the<br />  process of saving his life. <br />     <br />  But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />&#40;she too has<br />  plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things accordingly and <br />handling things<br />  accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself and is <br />clear in what<br />  she wants and what she can give. She is not interested in going<br />  about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste <br />her time on it.<br />  I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own life <br />happy rather than<br />  creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That way, I <br />would rate<br />  Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second. <br />     <br />  I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain <br />Head by Any<br />  Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a <br />particular place,<br />  that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I love you&#39; you <br />cannot understand<br />  what it actually means to love another person. That way, I feel <br />both<br />  Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and <br />emphatically. <br />     <br />  To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and <br />both you and<br />  your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. That <br />way I feel the<br />  only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. <br />And both do<br />  not expect anything in return for their love. They are happy and<br />  they make their loved ones happy too. <br />     <br />  My 5 cents <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />     <br />  thanks,<br />  Vidya. <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />  Pavithra Srinivasan"  <br />  Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:10 pm<br />  Subject: RE: Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />  Bravo!

While reading I felt all through the<br />    novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />   <br />    Poonguzhali&#39;s towards Arulmozhi: I didn&#39;t feel like<br />    poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />    of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />   <br />    Nandhini&#39;s towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />    selfish love. When she knows that she won&#39;t be able to<br />    get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />    "You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />    about!!!!"<br />   <br />    Vanadhi&#39;s towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai&#39;s towards<br />    VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />   <br />    Generally positions and throne and all won&#39;t matter<br />    much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />    beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />    pattamagishi or not, it wudn&#39;t impact much since<br />    anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />    that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />    Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />   <br />    Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini&#39;s is<br />    selfless and great. But still eventhough she hadn&#39;t<br />    been living with Sundara Chola throughout her lifetime<br />    atleast she had been with him for somedays, loved him<br />    and been loved by him. For that love, she cud have<br />    sacrificed and saved Sudara and his son.<br />   <br />    But in case of Manimegalai, she has been really<br />    selfless to sacrifice even her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> not knowing<br />    for sure whether he loves her or not..<br />   <br />    Manimegalai tops the rating!!!!!!!!!!<br />   <br />    Cheers,<br />    Sathya<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    sridhar rathinam sridhar_rathinam@y...<br />    Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 12:44 am<br />    Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Thanks Ram and Sathya..<br />   <br />    That was interesting..i agree with you..Manthagini and<br />  Manimegalai in that order.Manthagini inspite of her being wronged<br />  still does everything for her beloved..Kalki really potrays her true<br />  love so well...especially in the scenes where she dots around Arun<br />  mozhi varman.....<br />   <br />    No wonder they immortalised her by making her a Goddess even<br />  today there is a Temple for the SingalaNachi Amman in Thanjavur OFF<br />  Medical College road which allegedly was built for Mandhakini by<br />  Arunmozhi....<br />   <br />    Manimegalai had all the sweet innocence and sacrifices everything<br />  for her love..well whether manimegalai would have loved Vandhiyadevan<br />  inspite of his betrayal...Mm well she knows he didnt love her and<br />  used her with his seettalk to get near Karikalan she forgives him and<br />  loves him so I m sure She would have done the same...True love always<br />  does it.<br />   <br />    Nandhini...well did she really love one person atleast<br />  truely...that&#39;s the question which Kalki leaves us with..but she<br />  constantly does keep reminding Karikalan of her love..even before his<br />  death..<br />   <br />    Kunthavai..the potrayal of her charecter is so high that she<br />  never reveals her love or mental urmaoil..Infact in the whole series<br />  there would be tears in her eyes only on a few occasions...<br />   <br />    Vanathi what starts as an innocent love later becomes<br />  mature....she even dares to attain gajendra motcham for Arunmozhi..<br />   <br />    Pongulali...well it aws just a sort of Infactuation...crush sort<br />  of thing..<br />   <br />    The importnat tHing about Kalki is people and their attitute<br />  changes from Time to ..I found it hard to beleive as normal when I<br />  first read it in sixth standard&#40;and hve read it almost every year<br />  during the final exams a great stress releiver&#41; but as I have grown<br />  older..

But as a princess, she has to<br />  be. When taking<br />    kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of things. A<br />  princess of a<br />    big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, actually,<br />    falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you<br />  look at the<br />    way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and helps the<br />  love to grow<br />    between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she wanted to<br />  be in Chozha<br />    nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn&#39;t<br />    have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th<br />  bagam if I am<br />    right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything else in her<br />  life. She<br />    knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and for that<br />  what she can<br />    expect in return. She is pretty clear.<br />   <br />    * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />   <br />    She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have<br />  to keep that in<br />    mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and she<br />  takes a wow that<br />    she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As Ram<br />  aptly puts it,<br />    the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />    harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />   <br />    * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />   <br />    As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in<br />  love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />    from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she loves her<br />  brother so<br />    much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her brother&#41; has<br />  been<br />    instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, its because<br />  she<br />    realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is<br />  wrong that she<br />    goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation where<br />  she loves this<br />    guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a<br />  conflicting version and<br />    then she realizes something else. And in the end, everything<br />    goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its<br />  fate that<br />    plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with the<br />  love she has for<br />    <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to her<br />  brother, I doubt<br />    she would have acted the way she did. That&#39;s not in her<br />  character.<br />   <br />    * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />   <br />    Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example<br />  of leaf who<br />    is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants as and<br />  when she wants to<br />    just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I doubt if she<br />  herself knows<br />    what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is power. In<br />    the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />  seeing how strong<br />    his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />  But in the end<br />    she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat elsewhere. But she<br />  did have a<br />    lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />    again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people<br />  including Ravidasan.<br />   <br />    * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />   <br />    She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost<br />  his way. So all<br />    she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s another<br />  love at first<br />    sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy from a<br />  bear. She is an<br />    exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />    around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and<br />  disappointment in<br />    life. But her love for one man in her life is predominant above<br />  everything<br />    else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She keeps<br />  roaming around SC<br />    and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />    time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life<br />  in the process<br />    of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary character who<br />  cant be compared<br />    to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her love with<br />  anyone&#39;s for as<br />    I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life was<br />    dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br />   <br />    * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />   <br />    This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She<br />  realized that there<br />    was no point in going ahead with something that would never get<br />  fulfilled.<br />    Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the love<br />  that Sendhan<br />    Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise decision both<br />  for<br />    herself and for AM.<br />   <br />   <br />    Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would<br />  say it was<br />    Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And she<br />  died in the<br />    process of saving his life.<br />   <br />    But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give<br />  &#40;she too has<br />    plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things accordingly and<br />  handling things<br />    accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself and is<br />  clear in what<br />    she wants and what she can give. She is not interested in going<br />    about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste<br />  her time on it.<br />    I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own life<br />  happy rather than<br />    creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That way, I<br />  would rate<br />    Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second.<br />   <br />    I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain<br />  Head by Any<br />    Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a<br />  particular place,<br />    that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I love you&#39; you<br />  cannot understand<br />    what it actually means to love another person. That way, I feel<br />  both<br />    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and<br />  emphatically.<br />   <br />    To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and<br />  both you and<br />    your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. That<br />  way I feel the<br />    only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and Kundhavai.<br />  And both do<br />    not expect anything in return for their love. They are happy and<br />    they make their loved ones happy too.<br />   <br />    My 5 cents <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />   <br />    thanks,<br />    Vidya.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Pavithra Srinivasan" pavithrasri@h...<br />    Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:10 pm<br />    Subject: RE: Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Bravo!

love.She was<br />    greatly impressed by <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It was his &#39;character&#39; that<br />    made her love him.He had all qualifications she<br />    expected like someone who would stay with in Chola<br />    empire..But She was not &#39;just a princess&#39;.She was a<br />    very important person who was involved in<br />    administration,whose opnions were greatly valued.When<br />    <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> was imprisoned she could not cry like<br />    Manimekalai.She carefully handled the kingdom,the<br />    politics,her brother,her father and also her love.Her<br />    love was not &#39;the most important&#39; in her view.Yet she<br />    wouldn&#39;t have loved anyone else too.<br />    So she was first a princess and then a lover.<br />   <br />    Poonkullai loved Arulmolli as people of chola kingdom<br />    did.It was not true love-she admired him,liked him but<br />    was not sure whether she wanted to live in a palace or<br />    not.She realised the true love of Senthan AMuthan and<br />    reciprocated to it.It was Senthan Amuthan&#39;s love that<br />    made her love him.So her love becomes a deeper one.<br />   <br />    Vanathi&#39;s love...she loved Arul Molli varmar and not<br />    Rajarajachola&#40;i.e the king&#41;.Her love was love at first<br />    sight.She would do anything for Arulmozhivarmar.<br />   <br />    Nandhini&#39;s love for Karikalan...it&#39;s not true love.She<br />    wanted to be rich,to be a queen and that made her love<br />    him.It was clearly a love for purpose.<br />   <br />    Mandhahini and her father only lived in that<br />    island.Imagine Mandhahini alone in a island meets a<br />    handsome stranger who loves her even when he knows she<br />    is dumb.So naturally she loved him.Her life was filled<br />    with joy when she was with Sundara Chola.So he is the<br />    only one she loved forever.Her love had no bounds.It&#39;s<br />    well expressed in the story.She was a noble character.<br />   <br />    Manimekalai&#39;s love was blind.From the words of her<br />    brother she started loving <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.She really didn&#39;t know<br />    much about him.It was her imaginations that made her<br />    love him.Even it is her imagination the made her<br />    mentally disturbed in the end.So it was a mad love.<br />   <br />    Now which is better-a matured love,love at first<br />    sight,blind love,love for purpose,or love the extends<br />    to generations.<br />    Not only Mandhahini, Pooonguzhali & Vanathi would have<br />    sacrificed their lives for their love and would have<br />    shown kindness to their children.&#40;I think so!&#41;<br />   <br />    But there is onething-the love of Nandhini for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It<br />    is not insisted much.yet it made me think - Nandhini<br />    form her childhood wanted power & wealth and was<br />    making moves to get that.Yet she lost her heart to<br />    <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.Her psoition was critical-she wanted to take<br />    revenge,restore Padyas to power,Kill Karikalan--yet<br />    she had a love which could never be expressed and<br />    which would never be accepted.But I know that there&#39;ll<br />    be contradictions whether she loved <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> or not.<br />   <br />    Among all I find love of Kundhavai & Nandhini to<br />    <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>,because they considered love to be an important<br />    part of life-yet a part of life.It is the practical<br />    way too.<br />   <br />    Regarding changing the title-<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is better.Even there<br />    came a &#39;thodar&#39;in Kalki titled <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> which explained the<br />    life of Kalki.So kaliki is <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.I welcome discussions on<br />    other novels also.<br />   <br />    yours<br />    Im.Lakshmi<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Thank you fiends for all your participation and commentsÂ…<br />   <br />    Sridhar<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Regards<br />    Sri<br />   <br />    ragavadacri ragavadacri@ wrote: <br />  Dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> fans,<br />   <br />    I am also an &#39;adimai&#39;

			<div class="content">Thanks Vijay for your msg. Happy to hear that u enjoyed the verse...<br /><br />yes u r right... "the book is titled ponniyin selvan...so its arulmozhi<br />who is rightful claimant to the tile of nayagan...".<br /><br />But shall we look at some reasons to substantiate that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> can well be<br />the nayagan?<br /><br />1. The magnum opus opens with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> at Veeranarayana lake; the story<br />gradually unfolds and flows through his moves taking us to places where<br />he meets different people and finally comes to an end with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>. So, <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> is<br />there at the begining & the end...<br /><br />2. Kalki scripted this novel, in my opinion, to make the readers looking<br />at the entire happenings "through his eyes". All the characters are<br />conceived by the readers "in relation to" <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> only...<br /><br />3. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a super-human with unmatchable qualities... hence an ordinary<br />man - the reader - CANNOT connect himself with the character which may<br />hinder the process of getting involved with the story. So, Kalki chose<br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> - the boy-next-door - kinda character to help readers connect<br />themselves better with the role and develop great interest and<br />involvement...<br /><br />Actually, there is no competition for Kundavai for the nayagi<br />position... however, here are some...<br /><br />1. She is the lover of our nayagan (idhu onre podhaadaa... nam tamil<br />cinema vazhakkapadi.. !!!)<br /><br />2. She is the one who is literally making everyone to act... the<br />King-maker. She directs, makes everyone think and orders others to act<br />according to what she says... incl. the most powerful characters like <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />& <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>...<br /><br />Do these sound justifying ?<br /><br />Cheers!!!<br />Ragav<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>So, as many pointed out I also give my opinion about the loves. one<br />  by<br />    one... mudhalil nam kadhaiyin nayagan & nayagi...<br />   <br />    KUNDAVAI&#39;s love on <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym><br />   <br />   <br />  that was quite a long one in english tamil, but enjoyed it. keep them<br />  coming.<br /> <br />  btw how sure are you that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>& Kundavai are the nayagan &<br />  nayagi.....the book is titled ponniyin selvan...so its arulmozhi who<br />  is rightful claimant to the tile of nayagan....but thats the beauty of<br />  kalki.....the depth of characterisation of each member - be it real or<br />  reel.they are given their own space - at different times, thats the<br />  beauty of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>....the mantle shifts right though...its true for the<br />  women as well..<br /> <br />  the enjoyment is multipled when we read the old books &#40; hard copy nor<br />  soft copy&#41; ..aptly caught by the masters pen and brought to life<br />  through the immortal sketches of manian as well..its easy to show diff<br />  in the man&#39;s face while sketching - a beard here, a mustache there, a<br />  mole here, a different hair style.....not easy for women though -quite<br />  often you find lady characters hard to differenitate esp while looking<br />  for historical fiction and sketches in them...but not in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. i can<br />  close my eyes and imagine tyaga vidankar walking towards the light<br />  house, rakkamal peeping from behind a tree, nandhini acting like the<br />  ghost, ravidasan.....not that kalki&#39;s delightful work needs it but the<br />  sketches add azagukku azagu.<br /> <br />  rgds<br />  vj</div></blockquote></div>
