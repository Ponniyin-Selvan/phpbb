Its ATROCIOUS to <br />      intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote <br />from <br />  a <br />    few. I was shocked to hear <br />      from my friend that all tv channels say &#39;chitirai tirunal <br />    vazhthukkal&#39; &#40;as did one of our <br />      member&#41; and not puthandu vazhtukkal..<br />      <br />      I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If <br />people <br />  say <br />    that this group is not <br />      the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly <br />  in <br />    our groups purview. When we <br />      say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this <br />  not a <br />    big hit to our culture?<br />      <br />      &#39;Nenju porukudhillaye. .intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />    vittaal&#39;..beautiful words of <br />      Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />  have <br />    the back bone to fight <br />      against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />  talked <br />    with my friend around <br />      1.30 in the night &#40;my time&#41; and i could not sleep further. <br />    Wondering where the country is <br />      heading.. <br />      <br />      Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not <br />even <br />  a <br />    mention of this in our <br />      group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on <br />the <br />  new <br />    year. If tanjai periya <br />      koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />    saying that its a hit for our <br />      culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?<br />      <br />      who gave these people such authority to change religious <br />things <br />  as <br />    they wish. Will these <br />      people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam <br />  eout <br />    of India we should not <br />      follow that calendar? <br />      <br />      Ravi, <br />      <br />      I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />    mythology. I used to think in <br />      those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I <br />feel <br />    these are also mini <br />      pralaya&#39;s where the dharma is being disturbed. <br />      <br />      If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />    caveat of creamy layer, our <br />      so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will <br />revisit <br />    the criteria for creamy <br />      layer..<br />      <br />      <br />      For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the <br />state <br />  and <br />    the country, say that <br />      without these people their community could not have improved, <br />I <br />    like to quote Swami <br />      Chinmayananda,<br />      <br />      &#39;The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />  could <br />    have done better, if the <br />      situations were different&#39;.<br />      <br />      How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people <br />will <br />  be <br />    bashing the hindu and <br />      their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but <br />  who <br />    the hell are they to say <br />      that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai <br />1? <br />      <br />      Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not <br />  on <br />    the streets. <br />      <br />      Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />    should be written in this <br />      group. As rightly pointed out by Arun &#40;is that Arun? &#41; we try <br />to <br />    brush things under the <br />      carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it <br />and <br />    gain and spread knowledge <br />      about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion <br />    theory is a myth, we still <br />      stick to it because talking about it going to create <br />controversy.<br />      <br />      And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and <br />    preserve culture, but dont <br />      spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br />      <br />      Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from <br />  others <br />    perspective, this mail is <br />      surely not related this group.<br />      <br />      God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism....<br />      <br />      Regards,<br />      Satish<br />     <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more.

			<div class="content">You are right SPS. Then the govt. should have tried to study the<br />origin of the names rather than changing the new year over night.<br /><br />now will they have a new set of names for each year starting with Thai<br />1? Yes may be, they will name each year after each caste leader for<br />the vote bank.<br /><br />Yes. Karunanidhi may be a well versed in tamil, but a scholar should<br />use his brains for the benefit of the masses and not to hurt the<br />masses or take them for a ride. This attitude differentiates Hitler<br />from Gandhi. <br /><br />I also like to know more on this move, was there any<br />scientific/literary study done to make this change of Thai 1 as the<br />tamil new year? As you say that Karunanidhi is the only living Tamil<br />scholar, did he give any explanation to this move? This is not a<br />sarcastic question, but a genuine one to know on what basis the move<br />was brought forward.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>================================================<br />  Dear Natarajan,<br />  <br />  I am sure you are aware how much regard I have for you.<br />  <br />  Pls summerise the protests .. their view points.<br />  <br />  And also explain why the Tamil months are called PRABHAVA - VIBHAVA <br />  etc.<br />  <br />  regards/ sps<br />  --------------------</div></blockquote></div>

Will these <br />        people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it <br />cam <br />    eout <br />      of India we should not <br />        follow that calendar? <br />        <br />        Ravi, <br />        <br />        I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />      mythology. I used to think in <br />        those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I <br />  feel <br />      these are also mini <br />        pralaya&#39;s where the dharma is being disturbed. <br />        <br />        If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with <br />the <br />      caveat of creamy layer, our <br />        so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will <br />  revisit <br />      the criteria for creamy <br />        layer..<br />        <br />        <br />        For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the <br />  state <br />    and <br />      the country, say that <br />        without these people their community could not have <br />improved, <br />  I <br />      like to quote Swami <br />        Chinmayananda,<br />        <br />        &#39;The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />    could <br />      have done better, if the <br />        situations were different&#39;.<br />        <br />        How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people <br />  will <br />    be <br />      bashing the hindu and <br />        their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, <br />but <br />    who <br />      the hell are they to say <br />        that panchangam should not be read in the temples on <br />cithirai <br />  1? <br />        <br />        Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if <br />not <br />    on <br />      the streets. <br />        <br />        Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and <br />what <br />      should be written in this <br />        group. As rightly pointed out by Arun &#40;is that Arun? &#41; we <br />try <br />  to <br />      brush things under the <br />        carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it <br />  and <br />      gain and spread knowledge <br />        about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan <br />invasion <br />      theory is a myth, we still <br />        stick to it because talking about it going to create <br />  controversy.<br />        <br />        And we say that this group likes to bring out true history <br />and <br />      preserve culture, but dont <br />        spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.<br />        <br />        Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from <br />    others <br />      perspective, this mail is <br />        surely not related this group.<br />        <br />        God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism....<br />        <br />        Regards,<br />        Satish<br />       <br />     <br />    <br />    <br />     <br />    <br />    <br />    Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more. You name it, <br />we <br />  have it <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="onhttp://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/">onhttp://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote></div>
