			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by sv24in  using id sv24in</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Who is Nandini?<br /><br />When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based on <br />the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how to <br />start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to begin <br />this series with a question which pops in all our minds while we read <br />this great epic Â– "Who is Nandini?"<br /><br />I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by any <br />author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the entire <br />novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we get to know <br />a new facet about her character and equally a new secret about her <br />life.<br /><br />Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images that <br />this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery woman in <br />a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. When <br />Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After listening <br />to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a helpless girl who <br />was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but when Vandiya Devan <br />meets her for the first time she appears to be powerful woman with a <br />fleet of servants to do her bidding and she also wields enough power <br />to help him get inside the Fort.<br /><br />After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is <br />certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br /><br />The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.<br /><br />Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />who want avenge their king's death. <br /><br />Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic images <br />of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an unfortunate <br />woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br /><br />Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br /><br />I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br /><br />The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her memory <br />and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br /><br />Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? <br /><br />Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not recognize <br />him?<br /><br />The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two individuals <br />after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends Karuthiruman as a <br />messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi Karai by her <br />father. But when he arrives there he finds that Mandakini has had <br />another accident with result her memory is back. Now she does not <br />recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not know what happened <br />to her from the time she fell from the lighthouse and her last <br />accident. <br /><br />Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? Was <br />he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly because <br />I cannot imagine what other business a king like Veerapandiyan would <br />have with her. And that too, a king who has been ousted from his <br />kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to rally support. One would <br />think that he has lots of things in mind other than to wonder about <br />an unfortunate woman with whom he had traveled for a short while <br />unless he had developed a special love or affection for her. Only <br />that could have prompted him find out what happened to her.<br /><br />Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in Chola <br />household but before he could get this information to the king he is <br />captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that she was <br />pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to their <br />mother.<br /><br />Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a><!-- m -->) That is also <br />possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 Â– 22 years <br />before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. Either way <br />we get the same answer Â– Nandini is Veerapandiyan's daughter.<br /><br />The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must note. <br />When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he starts with <br />a preamble that Â– "Is it Ok if I combine some imagination as well <br />along with the story?" Now which part of it is imagination is <br />difficult for me to concur.<br /><br />After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of Nandini's <br />friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to Pandya <br />Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody to <br />wonder how come they both look alike.<br /><br />When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes place <br />the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's house. And <br />Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the Chola <br />soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at the <br />Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by Kundavai? Or <br />was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was her father? <br />What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? I <br />am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />told her so as well.<br /><br />But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic!<br /><br />Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him if <br />he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she needn't <br />have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had plainly put <br />across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and that might have <br />done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a mad rage. <br />Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She had <br />belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her wishes <br />fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in his mad <br />love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br /><br />Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters where <br />he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br /><br />Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's daughter <br />it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan the way she <br />did.    <br /><br />Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</div>
