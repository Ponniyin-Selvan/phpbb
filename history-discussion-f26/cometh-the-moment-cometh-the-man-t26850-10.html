I don&#39;t know if this is the<br />  original one<br />    since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but it<br />  still works.<br />    If this is not the original scale, you can always move it around.<br />   <br />    Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />   <br />    A# C D D# F G A<br />   <br />    The corresponding chords are: <br />   <br />    A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />   <br />    &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found that<br />  it<br />    usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to the<br />  chords&#41;.<br />   <br />    The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj Scale<br />  or the<br />    Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale. &#40;On<br />  the<br />    fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones<br />  &#40;half notes&#41;<br />    to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and chords<br />  remain<br />    the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On second<br />    thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call this<br />  the Gmin<br />    Scale.<br />   <br />    Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion: <br />   <br />   <br />    Dm Gm A# Dm<br />    Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />   <br />    Dm Gm A# Dm<br />    Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />   <br />    Dm Cm Gm<br />    Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />   <br />    Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />    Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />   <br />    Intro - 1<br />    ---------<br />   <br />    Stanza - 1<br />    ==========<br />   <br />    Dm A# Gm A#<br />    Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />   <br />    Dm A# Gm A#<br />    Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />   <br />    Cm Cm Cm A#<br />    Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />   <br />    A# A# A# Cm<br />    Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />   <br />    Cm Dm<br />    YenakkE thaan.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    The second stanza is similar.<br />   <br />    A few things to note: <br />   <br />    In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />   <br />   <br />    Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />   <br />    I IV V<br />   <br />   <br />    where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of the<br />  scale.<br />   <br />    1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves to the<br />  tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />    at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this interesting<br />  because<br />    usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually follow<br />  some<br />    chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the end.<br />   <br />   <br />    2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V &#40;nice..<br />  different<br />    from the usual I-IV-V.<br />   <br />    3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />    paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-V-IV-<br />  VII<br />    resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />   <br />    4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before<br />  getting to<br />    IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that. Creates<br />  a<br />    certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I,<br />  which is<br />    done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have<br />  found that<br />    I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs where<br />  there are<br />    scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />   <br />    5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix.<br />  Now this is<br />    obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the Maestro<br />  that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />    It creates a very nice effect.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Regards,<br />   <br />    Arun<br />   <br />    On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />   <br />      Sathish,<br />     <br />      Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

			<div class="content">Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong <br />aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with <br />little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste <br />factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended classes <br />and learnt formally. Some generic <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym> on old tamil classical songs in <br />case you are interested...<br /><br />G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman(SV Sekar's dad who gave music for MSS's <br />Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin <br />Mummoorthigal in those days.<br /><br />Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an <br />evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's unbearable<br />Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most <br />famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU Chinnappa's <br />clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />(Shankarabharanam). I can't recall more on CR right away. G <br />Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru. <br />Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna <br />Ramayanam...Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who <br />can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama puthiran <br />or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari that <br />way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV song to <br />Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.<br /><br />There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical <br />music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in <br />Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil <br />too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time. <br /><br />IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to give <br />him credit for that, and his creativity/innovation is perhaps <br />unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which unfortunately <br />is very forgotten.<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Well i have unfortunately never learned classical.. but..

I don&#39;t know if this is the<br />    original one<br />      since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but it<br />    still works.<br />      If this is not the original scale, you can always move it <br />around.<br />     <br />      Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />     <br />      A# C D D# F G A<br />     <br />      The corresponding chords are: <br />     <br />      A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />     <br />      &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found <br />that<br />    it<br />      usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to <br />the<br />    chords&#41;.<br />     <br />      The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj <br />Scale<br />    or the<br />      Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale. <br />&#40;On<br />    the<br />      fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones<br />    &#40;half notes&#41;<br />      to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and <br />chords<br />    remain<br />      the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On <br />second<br />      thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call <br />this<br />    the Gmin<br />      Scale.<br />     <br />      Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion: <br />     <br />     <br />      Dm Gm A# Dm<br />      Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />     <br />      Dm Gm A# Dm<br />      Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />     <br />      Dm Cm Gm<br />      Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />     <br />      Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />      Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />     <br />      Intro - 1<br />      ---------<br />     <br />      Stanza - 1<br />      ==========<br />     <br />      Dm A# Gm A#<br />      Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />     <br />      Dm A# Gm A#<br />      Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />     <br />      Cm Cm Cm A#<br />      Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />     <br />      A# A# A# Cm<br />      Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />     <br />      Cm Dm<br />      YenakkE thaan.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      The second stanza is similar.<br />     <br />      A few things to note: <br />     <br />      In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />     <br />     <br />      Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />     <br />      I IV V<br />     <br />     <br />      where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of <br />the<br />    scale.<br />     <br />      1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves to the<br />    tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />      at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this interesting<br />    because<br />      usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually <br />follow<br />    some<br />      chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the <br />end.<br />     <br />     <br />      2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V <br />&#40;nice..<br />    different<br />      from the usual I-IV-V.<br />     <br />      3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the <br />&#40;Ninaiththathu<br />      paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-<br />V-IV-<br />    VII<br />      resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />     <br />      4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before<br />    getting to<br />      IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that. <br />Creates<br />    a<br />      certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I,<br />    which is<br />      done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have<br />    found that<br />      I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs <br />where<br />    there are<br />      scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />     <br />      5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix.<br />    Now this is<br />      obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the <br />Maestro<br />    that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />      It creates a very nice effect.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Regards,<br />     <br />      Arun<br />     <br />      On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />     <br />        Sathish,<br />       <br />        Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

I don&#39;t know if this is the<br />      original one<br />        since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but it<br />      still works.<br />        If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />  around.<br />       <br />        Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />       <br />        A# C D D# F G A<br />       <br />        The corresponding chords are: <br />       <br />        A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />       <br />        &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found<br />  that<br />      it<br />        usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to<br />  the<br />      chords&#41;.<br />       <br />        The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj<br />  Scale<br />      or the<br />        Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale.<br />  &#40;On<br />      the<br />        fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones<br />      &#40;half notes&#41;<br />        to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and<br />  chords<br />      remain<br />        the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On<br />  second<br />        thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />  this<br />      the Gmin<br />        Scale.<br />       <br />        Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion: <br />       <br />       <br />        Dm Gm A# Dm<br />        Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />       <br />        Dm Gm A# Dm<br />        Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />       <br />        Dm Cm Gm<br />        Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />       <br />        Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />        Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />       <br />        Intro - 1<br />        ---------<br />       <br />        Stanza - 1<br />        ==========<br />       <br />        Dm A# Gm A#<br />        Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />       <br />        Dm A# Gm A#<br />        Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />       <br />        Cm Cm Cm A#<br />        Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />       <br />        A# A# A# Cm<br />        Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />       <br />        Cm Dm<br />        YenakkE thaan.<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        The second stanza is similar.<br />       <br />        A few things to note: <br />       <br />        In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />       <br />       <br />        Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />       <br />        I IV V<br />       <br />       <br />        where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of<br />  the<br />      scale.<br />       <br />        1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves to the<br />      tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />        at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this interesting<br />      because<br />        usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />  follow<br />      some<br />        chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the<br />  end.<br />       <br />       <br />        2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />  &#40;nice..<br />      different<br />        from the usual I-IV-V.<br />       <br />        3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />  &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />        paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-<br />  V-IV-<br />      VII<br />        resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />       <br />        4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before<br />      getting to<br />        IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />  Creates<br />      a<br />        certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I,<br />      which is<br />        done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have<br />      found that<br />        I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs<br />  where<br />      there are<br />        scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />       <br />        5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix.<br />      Now this is<br />        obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />  Maestro<br />      that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />        It creates a very nice effect.<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Regards,<br />       <br />        Arun<br />       <br />        On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />       <br />          Sathish,<br />         <br />          Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

			<div class="content">Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai <br />Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala <br />at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the <br />movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing. <br />Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in <br />Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great <br />but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or <br />cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used <br />many ragas and many singers.<br /><br />Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies <br />bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another <br />one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie <br />mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African  <br />samba music is another treat. <br /><br /><br />KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's <br />guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai <br />AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute <br />work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to <br />telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until <br />IR came on the seen again).<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thanks Malathy for that history lesson <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> I have Sampoorna <br />Ramayanam..<br />  didn&#39;t know it was by Ramanathan..

I find this <br />interesting<br />        because<br />          usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />    follow<br />        some<br />          chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards <br />the<br />    end.<br />         <br />         <br />          2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />    &#40;nice..<br />        different<br />          from the usual I-IV-V.<br />         <br />          3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />    &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />          paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />III-<br />    V-IV-<br />        VII<br />          resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />         <br />          4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression <br />before<br />        getting to<br />          IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />    Creates<br />        a<br />          certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to <br />the I,<br />        which is<br />          done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I <br />have<br />        found that<br />          I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs<br />    where<br />        there are<br />          scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />         <br />          5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the <br />mix.<br />        Now this is<br />          obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />    Maestro<br />        that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />          It creates a very nice effect.<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Regards,<br />         <br />          Arun<br />         <br />          On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />         <br />            Sathish,<br />           <br />            Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

I mean you can just let the<br />  movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />  Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />  Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day.

If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />  cassette &#40;tamil&#41; I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />  many ragas and many singers.<br /> <br />  Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />  bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />  one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />  mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />  samba music is another treat.<br /> <br />  KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala&#39;s<br />  guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />  AAluvan &#40;Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie&#41;, was an absolute<br />  work of genius.

I don&#39;t know if this is<br />  the<br />          original one<br />            since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />  it<br />          still works.<br />            If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />      around.<br />           <br />            Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />           <br />            A# C D D# F G A<br />           <br />            The corresponding chords are: <br />           <br />            A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />           <br />            &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />  found<br />      that<br />          it<br />            usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />  to<br />      the<br />          chords&#41;.<br />           <br />            The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />  A#maj<br />      Scale<br />          or the<br />            Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />  scale.<br />      &#40;On<br />          the<br />            fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />  semitones<br />          &#40;half notes&#41;<br />            to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;.

I find this<br />  interesting<br />          because<br />            usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />      follow<br />          some<br />            chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />  the<br />      end.<br />           <br />           <br />            2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />      &#40;nice..<br />          different<br />            from the usual I-IV-V.<br />           <br />            3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />      &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />            paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />  III-<br />      V-IV-<br />          VII<br />            resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />           <br />            4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />  before<br />          getting to<br />            IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />      Creates<br />          a<br />            certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />  the I,<br />          which is<br />            done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />  have<br />          found that<br />            I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs<br />      where<br />          there are<br />            scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />           <br />            5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />  mix.<br />          Now this is<br />            obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />      Maestro<br />          that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />            It creates a very nice effect.<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            Regards,<br />           <br />            Arun<br />           <br />            On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />           <br />              Sathish,<br />             <br />              Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

			<div class="content">Arun,<br /><br />I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. But in my<br />opinion one cannot put the work of IR in simple words, as mentioned in your<br />mail. He took the "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani /<br />Western Classical. He used this knowledge and fused them together when he<br />composed songs.<br /><br />For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in<br />music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket,<br />analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to film<br />music ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. If I<br />start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum.

I mean you can just let the<br />   movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />   Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />   Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />   but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />   cassette &#40;tamil&#41; I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />   many ragas and many singers.<br />  <br />   Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />   bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />   one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />   mohanam compositions.

KVM was Ghantasala&#39;s<br />   guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />   AAluvan &#40;Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie&#41;, was an absolute<br />   work of genius.

Perhaps one of the most<br />       famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />   Chinnappa&#39;s<br />       clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />       &#40;Shankarabharanam&#41;.

The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />   scale.<br />       &#40;On<br />           the<br />             fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />   semitones<br />           &#40;half notes&#41;<br />             to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and<br />       chords<br />           remain<br />             the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />   On<br />       second<br />             thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />       this<br />           the Gmin<br />             Scale.<br />            <br />             Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />   discussion: <br />            <br />            <br />             Dm Gm A# Dm<br />             Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />            <br />             Dm Gm A# Dm<br />             Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />            <br />             Dm Cm Gm<br />             Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />            <br />             Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />             Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />            <br />             Intro - 1<br />             ---------<br />            <br />             Stanza - 1<br />             ==========<br />            <br />             Dm A# Gm A#<br />             Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />            <br />             Dm A# Gm A#<br />             Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />            <br />             Cm Cm Cm A#<br />             Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />            <br />             A# A# A# Cm<br />             Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />            <br />             Cm Dm<br />             YenakkE thaan.<br />            <br />            <br />            <br />             The second stanza is similar.<br />            <br />             A few things to note: <br />            <br />             In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />            <br />            <br />             Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />            <br />             I IV V<br />            <br />            <br />             where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />   dominant of<br />       the<br />           scale.<br />            <br />             1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves<br />   to the<br />           tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />             at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this<br />   interesting<br />           because<br />             usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />       follow<br />           some<br />             chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />   the<br />       end.<br />            <br />            <br />             2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />       &#40;nice..<br />           different<br />             from the usual I-IV-V.<br />            <br />             3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />       &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />             paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />   III-<br />       V-IV-<br />           VII<br />             resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />            <br />             4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />   before<br />           getting to<br />             IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />       Creates<br />           a<br />             certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />   the I,<br />           which is<br />             done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />   have<br />           found that<br />             I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs<br />       where<br />           there are<br />             scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />            <br />             5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />   mix.<br />           Now this is<br />             obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />       Maestro<br />           that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />             It creates a very nice effect.<br />            <br />            <br />            <br />             Regards,<br />            <br />             Arun<br />            <br />             On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />            <br />               Sathish,<br />              <br />               Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

I mean you can just let the<br />   movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />   Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />   Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />   but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />   cassette &#40;tamil&#41; I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />   many ragas and many singers.<br />  <br />   Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />   bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />   one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />   mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />   samba music is another treat.<br />  <br />   KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala&#39;s<br />   guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />   AAluvan &#40;Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie&#41;, was an absolute<br />   work of genius.

I don&#39;t know if this is<br />   the<br />           original one<br />             since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />   it<br />           still works.<br />             If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />       around.<br />            <br />             Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />            <br />             A# C D D# F G A<br />            <br />             The corresponding chords are: <br />            <br />             A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />            <br />             &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />   found<br />       that<br />           it<br />             usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />   to<br />       the<br />           chords&#41;.<br />            <br />             The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />   A#maj<br />       Scale<br />           or the<br />             Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />   scale.<br />       &#40;On<br />           the<br />             fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />   semitones<br />           &#40;half notes&#41;<br />             to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and<br />       chords<br />           remain<br />             the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />   On<br />       second<br />             thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />       this<br />           the Gmin<br />             Scale.<br />            <br />             Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />   discussion: <br />            <br />            <br />             Dm Gm A# Dm<br />             Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />            <br />             Dm Gm A# Dm<br />             Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />            <br />             Dm Cm Gm<br />             Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />            <br />             Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />             Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />            <br />             Intro - 1<br />             ---------<br />            <br />             Stanza - 1<br />             ==========<br />            <br />             Dm A# Gm A#<br />             Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />            <br />             Dm A# Gm A#<br />             Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />            <br />             Cm Cm Cm A#<br />             Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />            <br />             A# A# A# Cm<br />             Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />            <br />             Cm Dm<br />             YenakkE thaan.<br />            <br />            <br />            <br />             The second stanza is similar.<br />            <br />             A few things to note: <br />            <br />             In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />            <br />            <br />             Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />            <br />             I IV V<br />            <br />            <br />             where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />   dominant of<br />       the<br />           scale.<br />            <br />             1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves<br />   to the<br />           tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />             at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this<br />   interesting<br />           because<br />             usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />       follow<br />           some<br />             chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />   the<br />       end.<br />            <br />            <br />             2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />       &#40;nice..<br />           different<br />             from the usual I-IV-V.<br />            <br />             3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />       &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />             paLiththathu&#41;.. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />   III-<br />       V-IV-<br />           VII<br />             resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />            <br />             4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />   before<br />           getting to<br />             IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />       Creates<br />           a<br />             certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />   the I,<br />           which is<br />             done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />   have<br />           found that<br />             I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. &#40;also songs<br />       where<br />           there are<br />             scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />            <br />             5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />   mix.<br />           Now this is<br />             obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />       Maestro<br />           that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />             It creates a very nice effect.<br />            <br />            <br />            <br />             Regards,<br />            <br />             Arun<br />            <br />             On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />            <br />               Sathish,<br />              <br />               Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

			<div class="content">Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or for that matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach where he was.<br />Â <br />Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction of money that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned in the credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without his name mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn helped several people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at all and he sangÂ many of his own songs since he could not afford playback singers, he wasa very good singer but in spite of that.Â In fact it was SPB who erected a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently.Â  Ghantasala died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the very last day. Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send anonymous money contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.<br /><br />There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond others. Kalai ulagam is a contribution of multiple people. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br />--- On Thu, 9/11/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Thursday, September 11, 2008, 1:04 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Arun,<br />Â <br />I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens.

He took theÂ "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classical.Â He used this knowledge and fused them togetherÂ when he composed songs.<br />Â <br />For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket, analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to filmmusic ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. IfI start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum.

And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African <br />samba music is another treat. <br /><br />KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's <br />guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai <br />AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute <br />work of genius.

I very much like the IR melodies<br />        mentioned ..Also true that tamil film world has had its share <br />of<br />        classical music greats before IR also - Some of KV Mahadevan <br />and<br />        Subbaraman&#39;s pieces are very memorable.<br />       <br />        --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com   40yahoogroups. com ,<br />   <br />        "Arun Krishnan"<br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />        creations and<br />          one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />        classical or<br />          western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum <br />on<br />    Madai<br />          Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea but <br />just to<br />        give you a<br />          flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way: <br />         <br />          Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and <br />discusses<br />    the<br />        tamil<br />          song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/ progression<br />    etc. I<br />        doubt it<br />          will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />    follow<br />        tamil<br />          songs AND play some instrument..<br />         <br />          I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to <br />the<br />        song "Madai<br />          Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..<br />         <br />          I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don&#39;t know if this is <br />the<br />        original one<br />          since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but <br />it<br />        still works.<br />          If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />    around.<br />         <br />          Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />         <br />          A# C D D# F G A<br />         <br />          The corresponding chords are: <br />         <br />          A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />         <br />          &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have <br />found<br />    that<br />        it<br />          usually helps to understand the scale first before going on <br />to<br />    the<br />        chords&#41;.<br />         <br />          The other thing to note is that you could call this the <br />A#maj<br />    Scale<br />        or the<br />          Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj <br />scale.<br />    &#40;On<br />        the<br />          fretboard, you can identify this by going down three <br />semitones<br />        &#40;half notes&#41;<br />          to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and<br />    chords<br />        remain<br />          the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. <br />On<br />    second<br />          thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />    this<br />        the Gmin<br />          Scale.<br />         <br />          Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief <br />discussion: <br />         <br />         <br />          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />         <br />          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />         <br />          Dm Cm Gm<br />          Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />         <br />          Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />          Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />         <br />          Intro - 1<br />          ---------<br />         <br />          Stanza - 1<br />          ==========<br />         <br />          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />         <br />          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />         <br />          Cm Cm Cm A#<br />          Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />         <br />          A# A# A# Cm<br />          Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />         <br />          Cm Dm<br />          YenakkE thaan.<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          The second stanza is similar.<br />         <br />          A few things to note: <br />         <br />          In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />         <br />         <br />          Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />         <br />          I IV V<br />         <br />         <br />          where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and <br />dominant of<br />    the<br />        scale.<br />         <br />          1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves <br />to the<br />        tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />          at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this <br />interesting<br />        because<br />          usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />    follow<br />        some<br />          chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards <br />the<br />    end.<br />         <br />         <br />          2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />    &#40;nice..<br />        different<br />          from the usual I-IV-V.<br />         <br />          3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />    &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />          paLiththathu&#41; .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />III-<br />    V-IV-<br />        VII<br />          resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />         <br />          4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression <br />before<br />        getting to<br />          IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />    Creates<br />        a<br />          certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to <br />the I,<br />        which is<br />          done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I <br />have<br />        found that<br />          I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . &#40;also songs<br />    where<br />        there are<br />          scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />         <br />          5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the <br />mix.<br />        Now this is<br />          obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />    Maestro<br />        that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />          It creates a very nice effect.<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Regards,<br />         <br />          Arun<br />         <br />          On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />         <br />            Sathish,<br />           <br />            Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!
