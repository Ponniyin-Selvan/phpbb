			<div class="content">Friends,<br /><br />Please bear with me, as I go about discussing things which are entirely not in relation to anything in historical sense...<br /><br />Satish/Diwakar,<br /><br />I think u guys misquoted me out of context... similar to what the politicians say whenever their original comments are not well-meaning. Also you guys can cut out the sir..<br /><br />First, I was referrign to only chrisitians/catholics.. and not even to protestants or other groups and specifically not to muslims at all. Muslims have endless no. of groups, praying methods, differentiations and each groups calls others as infidels.. and goes about exterminating other groups and religions...<br /><br />I was refering only to priests.. I did not take it to the level of Pope.. When you look at priests, in the catholic community, there are from the same community, irrespective of whether he is a nadar, or a non-nadar(I do know that nadar chrisitians are move caste oriented.. you can misquote me here)<br /><br />Lets see, if by means of sheer college methodology followed by Catholics, lets say our Hindu Madams(eg. Shankarar, Madurai, Dharamapuram) allows people of any caste to shed their inhibitions and become priests, thats when we can go around the town saying that we have managed to kill the Caste Demon.. Also this step could infact break the religious conversion from hinduism to other religions, and we could infact bring back Ambedkar's family back to Hinduism.. enna naan sollurathu..<br /><br />As far DK being in the meeting, their agenda was clear they are not worried about gods, but about human rights.. It was very much pathetic to note, that our temple priests are living lives as near beggars, with a monthly salary of 1200rs.. but again, these are also people who should also be uplifted..<br /><br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br /><br />Dhiwakar  wrote:<br /><br />satish,<br /><br />summmaa pinni pedal edukkariye saami....<br /><br />"padma vyoogathula" pugundhu kalakkina abhimanyu maadhiri<br />kalakkindirukka... continue continue.. aana unnai abhimanyu maadhiri<br />thavikka vida maatom.. naangalum ulle vandhu engalaal aana udhavi<br />pannuvom...<br /><br />As you said lot of comunities have their own problem...<br /><br />Mr. nanda was quoting muslims have flexibility..<br /><br />Mr. nanda sir, please read latest "nesakumar pakkam " on<br />tamil.sify.com....<br /><br />he says how many atrocities are there in muslim community.. he talks<br />of one group of muslims capturing the local mosque and the other<br />sections tries to get rid of them even by violence.. and how<br />the "periyavargal" of their community try to suppress the matter<br />before it reaches press and how the police turn deaf ear to the<br />problems.....<br /><br />pls read<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tamil.sify.com/art/nesakumar/fullstory.php?id=14247871&amp;page=5">http://tamil.sify.com/art/nesakumar/ful ... 871&amp;page=5</a><!-- m --><br /><br />indha maadhiri situation ulagathile irukkumbodhu, eppadi other<br />communities are flexible nnu neenga statement vidareenga????<br /><br />Hinduism madhiri flexible aana religion kidaiyave kidaiyaadhu...<br />purinjukkonga....<br /><br />brahmins are a sect based on profession.... as satish said earlier,<br />people become brahmins only by their deeds... the great saint<br />viswamitra who gave the gayathri mantram to the world is<br />a "kshatriya" sir.. purinjukkonga....<br /><br />also, no people compel brahmins to be the priest... we are talking<br />here about "core competency" sir.... core competency anybody can<br />develop and anybody can replace and be replaced...<br /><br />so , brahmin dominating here.. there and everywhere is all<br />nonsense....<br /><br />These politicians want vote... and to get the vote and keep people in<br />the dark so that whatever thing they do go unnoticed, these people<br />find a easy vehicle called brahmin bashin... for that matter hindu<br />bashing...<br /><br />these people are very actively supported by other religions also.....<br /><br />when da vinci code was banned in TN, dinamalar carried an article<br />about tamil books which contain similar stuff as that of the movie...<br />all these books were written by christians only ... yet nobody wants<br />to take notice of that and even mention that...<br /><br />that is because only hindu bashing sells and hindu bashing works...<br /><br />in vijay TV when there was a debate on all people becoming priests,<br />the funny part was that the thi.ka (DK) people were there suporting<br />all people can become priests...<br /><br />the basic question is , thi.ka people are anti god... then why do<br />they voice for a matter relating to temple..<br /><br />all that they can do in this issue is that take a stand that "people<br />should not go to temple at all".. there is a very good cause for them<br />in the issue to propogate their thoughts.. instead they are indulging<br />in this...<br /><br />this is a very ripe situation for them..<br /><br />thi.ka people pls note this.. this a very good idea for you...<br /><br />tha.mu.mu.ka was supporting coimbatore blasts.. they are part of the<br />ruling alliance now.. who is going to bell them..(nesa kumar pakkam)<br /><br />ennavo ponga.. niraya vishayam have been kept under a veil and a<br />malicious propaganda has been perpetrated.....<br /><br />in the northeast there are separatist groups entirely backed by the<br />church... idhukellaam enna solluveenga...<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Nanda,<br />  Good point. This has been discussed in length many a times.<br />Hinduism<br />  or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in<br />  any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa<br />and<br />  many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were brahmins<br />  by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned the<br />  trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that there<br />  is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives for<br />  more heated debates on this &#40;Priya vaishnava enga<br />  poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi<br />  varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella<br />  neenga mudikaliya&#41;<br /> <br />  I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church<br />  and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />  can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />  round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they<br />  both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But you<br />  call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta kalamda<br />  sami...<br /> <br />  anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A welcome<br />  rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone<br />who<br />  is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla<br />  atchi kavundhudum.<br /> <br />  And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. references<br />  to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This<br />  again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered<br />  being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the<br />  advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and conquered<br />  india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the<br />varnasrama<br />  dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are<br />  brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans<br />  are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the<br />  country.<br /> <br />  ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states<br />that<br />  only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these<br />theory<br />  says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam<br />  literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans eppadi<br />  sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not<br />  brahmins. engiyo idikala...<br /> <br />  and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu<br />  erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh always<br />  says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any<br />  Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference to<br />  the word &#39;dravida&#39; or any war between tamil kings and aryan kings?<br />I<br />  am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There<br />should<br />  be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have<br />  consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic<br />  neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until<br />  anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, even<br />a<br />  theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in<br />  sangam literature can mean something different or simply north<br />  indians&#40;as the article states in many places&#41; which we fail or<br />  rather dont want to think about.<br /> <br />  How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly<br />come<br />  and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be<br />  the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple,<br />  where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large<br />  crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to<br />  replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the<br />  foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer it<br />  etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any<br />  brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our<br />culture.<br />  Though not known to the common man, people even today think that<br />  brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non brahmins<br />  call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes<br />  and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules<br />cannot<br />  change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only<br />  for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. &#39;Dalit<br />  can become santhome church father&#39; cannot fetch vote- it will only<br />  split vote.<br /> <br />  As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other<br />  topics .moooch...<br /> <br />  Venkatesh,<br />  I think I discussed with you about &#39;Paramartha Guru&#39; stories in one<br />  of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil&#39; by<br />  Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. Hidden<br />  agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu saints.<br />  Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden agenda<br />  of conversion &#40;missionary activities mentioned at many places in<br />the<br />  article&#41;. So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can<br />  easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the<br />impact<br />  is seen even today.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi Satish/Diwakar,<br />   <br />    Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a<br />  culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the<br />  growth of hypocritical people..<br />   <br />    I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about<br />  non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one<br />  thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism<br />grew<br />  because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice,<br />  thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a<br />  priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and<br />  is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of<br />  being a priest. why can&#39;t our madams and adheenams take over that<br />  role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion<br />  amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the<br />  person is willing to perform his duties..<br />   <br />    Regards<br />    Nanda</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Find out what India is talking about on Yahoo!

This has been discussed in length many a times. <br />  Hinduism <br />    or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />    any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa <br />  and <br />    many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were <br />brahmins <br />    by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned <br />the <br />    trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that <br />there <br />    is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives <br />for <br />    more heated debates on this &#40;Priya vaishnava enga <br />    poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />    varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />    neenga mudikaliya&#41;<br />    <br />    I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />    and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />    can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />    round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />    both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga.

A <br />welcome <br />    rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone <br />  who <br />    is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />    atchi kavundhudum.<br />    <br />    And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. <br />references <br />    to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />    again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />    being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />    advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and <br />conquered <br />    india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the <br />  varnasrama <br />    dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />    brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />    are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />    country. <br />    <br />    ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states <br />  that <br />    only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these <br />  theory <br />    says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />    literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans <br />eppadi <br />    sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />    brahmins. engiyo idikala...<br />    <br />    and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />    erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh <br />always <br />    says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />    Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference <br />to <br />    the word &#39;dravida&#39; or any war between tamil kings and aryan <br />kings? <br />  I <br />    am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There <br />  should <br />    be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />    consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />    neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />    anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, <br />even <br />  a <br />    theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />    sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />    indians&#40;as the article states in many places&#41; which we fail or <br />    rather dont want to think about. <br />    <br />    How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly <br />  come <br />    and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />    the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />    where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />    crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />    replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />    foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer <br />it <br />    etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />    brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our <br />  culture. <br />    Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />    brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non <br />brahmins <br />    call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />    and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules <br />  cannot <br />    change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />    for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. &#39;Dalit <br />    can become santhome church father&#39; cannot fetch vote- it will <br />only <br />    split vote. <br />    <br />    As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />    topics .moooch... <br />    <br />    Venkatesh, <br />    I think I discussed with you about &#39;Paramartha Guru&#39; stories in <br />one <br />    of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil&#39; by <br />    Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. <br />Hidden <br />    agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu <br />saints. <br />    Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden <br />agenda <br />    of conversion &#40;missionary activities mentioned at many places in <br />  the <br />    article&#41;. So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />    easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the <br />  impact <br />    is seen even today. <br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish<br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      Hi Satish/Diwakar,<br />      <br />      Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a <br />    culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the <br />    growth of hypocritical people.. <br />      <br />      I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about <br />    non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one <br />    thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism <br />  grew <br />    because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, <br />    thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a <br />    priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas <br />and <br />    is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of <br />    being a priest. why can&#39;t our madams and adheenams take over that <br />    role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion <br />    amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the <br />    person is willing to perform his duties..<br />      <br />      Regards<br />      Nanda<br />     <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />           <br />  <br />   				<br />  ---------------------------------<br />  Find out what India is talking about on Yahoo!

Even though christianity preaches equality, christians as people practice sect-ism, caste-ism, group-ism, seperate-isms in their own ways.<br /><br />Every other set of people or group practices "isms" in an way in which people on top are able to control directly or indirectly or covertly also ...<br /><br />I think I will have to quote myself again "In the Church or in the college, anyone wanting to take up priesthood can join and grow to be a priest", but to be a Pope, there are other sets of critierias, try to read "Angels & Demons" by Dan Brown, it will give you a small hindsight into that.<br /><br />But in our Hindu religion, to be a priest and to be accepted inside a well known temple, your caste is the primary acceptance factor. Unless its a village temple priests, people from other castes are not allowed to be a priest, even if you are well versed in vedas, practicies and also practice it zealously..<br /><br />Think it over, also there could be other people who are probably feeling offended by our comments here..<br /><br />I am of the opinion that customs and rules are guidelines, but not to be used for filtering out people on the basis of birth.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Nanda<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dhiwakar  wrote:<br />satish,<br /><br />nee solradhu correct.. whatever govt feels as equality is equality...<br />enakku puriyalla adhu eppadinnu.....<br /><br />adhey maadhiri naama rendu peru + mr. nanda dhaan mai anupparom..<br />mathavanga yaarum .......asusual we both will be the castaways<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dhiwakar,<br />  I know that you wont mail from home and that too at that hour.

			<div class="content">I beg to differ!<br /><br />There are lot of differences, in priesthood on Hindu temples.<br /><br />There are temples that were conscruted by Tamil Kings, and these <br />Kings granted the priesthood to People who continue until today. All <br />these people were of Brahmin community, there may be exceptions, <br />that I am unaware.<br /><br />Priest at Palani claimed to be from the lineage, to whom Siddhar <br />Pulipaani adhikaram.<br /><br />There are temples, like you have mentioned, have preisthood governed <br />by different community Melmaruvathur by Vanniyar/Naicker, Putlur <br />Poongavanathammam by Vanniyar/Naicker, Melmalaiyanur by Sembadavar, <br />etc. And in temples like Padavedu, the 'Mudhal Mariyadhai', is for <br />Vannan/Dobhi caste. <br /><br />And we cannot imagine if a Brahmin claim to posses the later temple, <br />and hence similarly other caste into Brahmin temples.<br /><br />Some establishments like this are better to be untouched, and they <br />will function well. But, for Tamil Nadu it is a curse, that we are <br />never united on lingual grounds and always look for caste. <br /><br />Rajendhra Cholan!<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>satish/diwakar/others&#40;Lets get them also involved&#41;... <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />     <br />  I never said that there is no caste-ism in other religions.

I <br />    also noticed that the mails i send are delayed by 4-5 hours. do <br />    others face the same problem? <br />    <br />    Nanda, <br />    <br />    I understand your point.Ok. you say there is not caste in other <br />    religion. appo eppadi sir chatholic nadar non-catholic nadar <br />    picturela varanga...caste illana nadar mattum engirundhu <br />    vandhanga. .and Nadar is basically a hindu caste and how cam <br />    christians have that caste when they claim that christianity do <br />not <br />    have caste.marubadiyum idikkala.. I remember one joke fwd in <br />    emails....a person travelling in the last compartment of the <br />train <br />    wrote a letter to the station master..."Its difficult to getin <br />and <br />    out of the last compartment, when the train stops in the station <br />as <br />    the last compartment is outside the platform.

I dont find any <br />difference. <br />    Hinduismla brahmins oru sect-na,christinaityla catholics oru <br />sect. <br />    avvalavuthan. I really dont understand how you find equality in <br />    christian catholics and not in Hindus? <br />    <br />    And like Dhiwakar pointed out, conversion is not just by <br />  belief..its <br />    by money power. Every month, please note every month, any one <br />state <br />    in India gets around 3500 crore rupees for missionary <br />activities. <br />    <br />    I am totally for a society where equality is practiced.
