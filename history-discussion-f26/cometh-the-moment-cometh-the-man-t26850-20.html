			<div class="content">Malathi,<br />We are talking about talent not about the philanthropic activities of people<br />in the Cine field. I do have the highest regards for people who do all this<br />... That too with out a hint of publicity that they are doing that. But<br />thats not in the main stream discussion of this thread.<br /><br />Also earning money thats also not counted as there are other music directors<br />who have made loads of money which IR can never ever think of.<br /><br />So lets lets discuss music alone<br /><br />1. Talent / Exposure to music / Chances of learning music when they were<br />young / Surroundings ...<br />2. Knowledge of music (Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classic)<br />3. Application of what they learned<br />4. Innovation / Experiments in their field<br /><br />Having said that I am a great fan of Mr.MSV / Mr.KVM. I have not analyzed<br />Mr.KVM very critically to some extent Mr.MSV. Again I will tell you the<br />difference in cricketing terms (In which I am at home) In olden days Leg<br />Glance or Flick is played when the ball is pitching on leg stump and leaving<br />the leg stump. Playing that shot is not everybody's forte. Few played it<br />well.<br /><br />But it was GR Vishwanath who re-defined the flick / leg glance. Even if the<br />ball pitches on off stump and moves towards middle stump he would flick the<br />ball and it will run to boundary. He would do this effortlessly .<br />Improvisation at its best. Defying the grammar of music I have given<br />examples in my earlier posy\t.<br /><br />Similarly late cut between Wicket Keeper and 1st slip / 1st slip and 2nd<br />slip / Slip and Gully. All these need little variation in his hand grip,<br />open the face of the bat and timing. Similarly moving from one Raga to<br />another Rage and then coming back to the rage where he started -- IR is a<br />master in that.<br /><br />Vishy use to play shots in a area where there is no fielder. The bowling<br />captain would move a fielder to the position where Vishy scored runs.<br />Immediately Vishy would play a shot into the place from where the fielder<br />was moved. IR would compose on Ragas which others would not even think of.<br /><br />Laters!<br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />On Thu, Sep 11, 2008 at 5:40 PM, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or for that<br />  matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach where he was.<br /> <br />  Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction of money<br />  that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned in the<br />  credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without his name<br />  mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn helped several<br />  people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at all and he<br />  sang many of his own songs since he could not afford playback singers, he<br />  was a very good singer but in spite of that. In fact it was SPB who erected<br />  a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently. Ghantasala<br />  died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the very last day.<br />  Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send anonymous money<br />  contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.<br />  There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond others. Kalai<br />  ulagam is a contribution of multiple people.<br /> <br />  Malathi<br />  --- On *Thu, 9/11/08, Udanx * wrote: <br /> <br />  From: Udanx <br />  Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />  To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  Date: Thursday, September 11, 2008, 1:04 AM<br /> <br />  Arun,<br /> <br />  I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. But in my<br />  opinion one cannot put the work of IR in simple words, as mentioned in your<br />  mail. He took the "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani /<br />  Western Classical. He used this knowledge and fused them together when he<br />  composed songs.<br /> <br />  For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in<br />  music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket,<br />  analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to film<br />  music ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. If I<br />  start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum. For me<br />  other musicians great people /doyens and this man is a LEGEND.<br /> <br />  ~ Udanx<br /> <br />  On Thu, Sep 11, 2008 at 10:17 AM, Arun Krishnan    wrote: <br /> <br />   A veritable fount of information! <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> Thanks for all that.<br />   I always wondered why KVM didn&#39;t do more movies in Tamizh..<br />   Shankarabharanam was KVM right?<br />   Great songs!<br />  <br />   The thing about IR was that he made songs based on classical ragas but<br />   made them in such a way that it was easily hummable by the masses.. amazing.<br />  <br />   Arun<br />  <br />  <br />   On Thu, Sep 11, 2008 at 6:33 AM, dmaloo     wrote: <br />  <br />    Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai<br />    Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala<br />    at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the<br />    movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />    Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />    Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />    but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />    cassette &#40;tamil&#41; I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />    many ragas and many singers.<br />   <br />    Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />    bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />    one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />    mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />    samba music is another treat.<br />   <br />    KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala&#39;s<br />    guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />    AAluvan &#40;Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie&#41;, was an absolute<br />    work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to<br />    telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone &#40;until<br />    IR came on the seen again&#41;.<br />   <br />   <br />    Malathi<br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com,<br />    "Arun Krishnan"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      Thanks Malathy for that history lesson <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> I have Sampoorna<br />    Ramayanam..<br />      didn&#39;t know it was by Ramanathan..

Perhaps one of the most<br />        famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />    Chinnappa&#39;s<br />        clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />        &#40;Shankarabharanam&#41; .

Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />        Telugu &#40;Ghantasala&#39;s Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />        too&#41;.I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.<br />       <br />        IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to<br />    give<br />        him credit for that, and his creativity/innovati on is perhaps<br />   <br />        unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which<br />    unfortunately<br />        is very forgotten.<br />       <br />        Malathi<br />       <br />       <br />        --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com   40yahoogroups. com  ,<br />        "Arun Krishnan"<br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          Well i have unfortunately never learned classical.. but..

I don&#39;t know if this is<br />    the<br />            original one<br />              since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />    it<br />            still works.<br />              If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />        around.<br />             <br />              Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes: <br />             <br />              A# C D D# F G A<br />             <br />              The corresponding chords are: <br />             <br />              A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim<br />             <br />              &#40;I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />    found<br />        that<br />            it<br />              usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />    to<br />        the<br />            chords&#41;.<br />             <br />              The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />    A#maj<br />        Scale<br />            or the<br />              Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />    scale.<br />        &#40;On<br />            the<br />              fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />    semitones<br />            &#40;half notes&#41;<br />              to find the relative minor of a major scale&#41;. The notes and<br />        chords<br />            remain<br />              the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />    On<br />        second<br />              thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />        this<br />            the Gmin<br />              Scale.<br />             <br />              Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />    discussion: <br />             <br />             <br />              Dm Gm A# Dm<br />              Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,<br />             <br />              Dm Gm A# Dm<br />              Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,<br />             <br />              Dm Cm Gm<br />              Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram<br />             <br />              Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />              Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu<br />             <br />              Intro - 1<br />              ---------<br />             <br />              Stanza - 1<br />              ==========<br />             <br />              Dm A# Gm A#<br />              Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu<br />             <br />              Dm A# Gm A#<br />              Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu<br />             <br />              Cm Cm Cm A#<br />              Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,<br />             <br />              A# A# A# Cm<br />              Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,<br />             <br />              Cm Dm<br />              YenakkE thaan.<br />             <br />             <br />             <br />              The second stanza is similar.<br />             <br />              A few things to note: <br />             <br />              In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so: <br />             <br />             <br />              Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F<br />             <br />              I IV V<br />             <br />             <br />              where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />    dominant of<br />        the<br />            scale.<br />             <br />              1. The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves<br />    to the<br />            tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />              at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this<br />    interesting<br />            because<br />              usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />        follow<br />            some<br />              chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />    the<br />        end.<br />             <br />             <br />              2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />        &#40;nice..<br />            different<br />              from the usual I-IV-V.<br />             <br />              3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />        &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />              paLiththathu&#41; .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />    III-<br />        V-IV-<br />            VII<br />              resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />             <br />              4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />    before<br />            getting to<br />              IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />        Creates<br />            a<br />              certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />    the I,<br />            which is<br />              done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />    have<br />            found that<br />              I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . &#40;also songs<br />        where<br />            there are<br />              scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />             <br />              5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />    mix.<br />            Now this is<br />              obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />        Maestro<br />            that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />              It creates a very nice effect.<br />             <br />             <br />             <br />              Regards,<br />             <br />              Arun<br />             <br />              On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />             <br />                Sathish,<br />               <br />                Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

I do have the highest regards for people who do all this ... That too with out a hint of publicity that they are doing that. But thats not in the main stream discussion of this thread.Â <br /><br /><br />Also earning money thats also not counted as there are other music directors who have made loads of money which IR can never ever think of.<br /><br /><br />So lets lets discuss music alone<br /><br /><br />Talent / Exposure to music / Chances of learning music when they were young/ Surroundings ...<br /><br />Knowledge of music (Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classic)<br />Application of what they learned<br />Innovation / Experiments in their field<br />Having said that I am a great fan of Mr.MSV / Mr.KVM. I have notÂ analyzedMr.KVM very critically to some extent Mr.MSV. Again I will tell you the difference in cricketing terms (In which I am at home)Â In olden daysÂ Leg Glance or Flick is played when the ball is pitching on leg stump and leaving the leg stump. Playing that shot is not everybody's forte. Few played it well.<br /><br /><br />But it was GR Vishwanath who re-defined the flick / leg glance. Even if theball pitches on off stump and moves towards middle stump he would flick the ball and it will run to boundary. He would do this effortlessly . Improvisation at its best. Defying theÂ grammarÂ of music I have given examples in my earlier posy\t.Â <br /><br /><br />Similarly late cut between Wicket Keeper and 1st slip / 1st slip and 2nd slip / Slip and Gully. All these need little variation in his hand grip, openthe face of the bat and timing. Similarly moving from one Raga to another Rage and then coming back to the rage where he started -- IR is a master inthat.<br /><br /><br />Vishy use to play shots in a area where there is no fielder. The bowling captain would move a fielder to the position where Vishy scored runs. Immediately Vishy would play a shot into the place from where the fielder was moved. IR would compose on Ragas which others would not even think of.<br /><br /><br />Laters!Â <br /><br /><br />~ Udanx<br /><br />On Thu, Sep 11, 2008 at 5:40 PM, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or for that matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach where he was.<br />Â <br />Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction of money that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned in the credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without his name mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn helped several people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at all and he sangÂ many of his own songs since he could not afford playback singers, he wasa very good singer but in spite of that.Â In fact it was SPB who erected a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently.Â  Ghantasala died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the very last day. Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send anonymous money contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.<br /><br />There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond others. Kalai ulagam is a contribution of multiple people. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Thu, 9/11/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />Date: Thursday, September 11, 2008, 1:04 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Arun,<br />Â <br />I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens.

He took theÂ "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classical.Â He used this knowledge and fused them togetherÂ when he composed songs.<br />Â <br />For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket, analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to filmmusic ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. IfI start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum.

If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or <br />cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used <br />many ragas and many singers.<br /><br />Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies <br />bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another <br />one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie <br />mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African <br />samba music is another treat. <br /><br />KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's <br />guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai <br />AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute <br />work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to <br />telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until <br />IR came on the seen again).<br /><br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Arun Krishnan" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thanks Malathy for that history lesson <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> I have Sampoorna <br />Ramayanam..<br />  didn&#39;t know it was by Ramanathan..

The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then resolves <br />to the<br />        tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />          at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this <br />interesting<br />        because<br />          usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />    follow<br />        some<br />          chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards <br />the<br />    end.<br />         <br />         <br />          2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />    &#40;nice..<br />        different<br />          from the usual I-IV-V.<br />         <br />          3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />    &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />          paLiththathu&#41; .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />III-<br />    V-IV-<br />        VII<br />          resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />         <br />          4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression <br />before<br />        getting to<br />          IV-V at the end &#40;Cm - Dm&#41; .. and letting it hang like that.<br />    Creates<br />        a<br />          certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to <br />the I,<br />        which is<br />          done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I <br />have<br />        found that<br />          I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . &#40;also songs<br />    where<br />        there are<br />          scale changes... but thats for another day&#41;.<br />         <br />          5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the <br />mix.<br />        Now this is<br />          obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />    Maestro<br />        that <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />          It creates a very nice effect.<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Regards,<br />         <br />          Arun<br />         <br />          On Wed, Sep 10, 2008 at 9:25 AM, Udanx  wrote: <br />         <br />            Sathish,<br />           <br />            Ilayaraaja has won national award thrice!

			<div class="content">Udanx, I mentioned philanthropic acts in honor of those because of <br />their dedication to music even when very little money was involved. <br />You cannot discount the money factor since composing music is very <br />hard work and very difficult to do when money involved is less. <br />Please enlighten me on who are the music directors who made more <br />money than IR? Perhaps Rehman now. But In Tamil atleast - IR in his <br />heydays made more than even top notch Hindi directors. My uncle was <br />in income tax and every year his house was a prime target for their <br />raids. They found currency even in his puja room, under the deity. It <br />is a true fact.<br /><br />Now let us move on to creativity. One thing - the fusion music that <br />we are talking about is not special. It is one form of music, that is <br />all. Thinking it is higher/lower than traditional music is like <br />saying abstract art is better than realism, or cubism is better than <br />impressionism. No. All are art forms and there are artistes who are <br />good at each of them. IR's forte undoubtedly is his creativity and <br />innovation. Violinist L Subramaniam and Sitar maestro Ravishankar <br />have produced great fusion music - there are people who like them and <br />people who don't. L Subramaniam is not greater than Lalgudi or TN <br />Krishnan just because he produced great fusion music.<br /><br />Yes IR made semi classical music more hummable, hmmm, perhaps. He <br />came at a time when classical music was taking a real beating and all <br />music directors including MSV were past their time. That combined <br />with his natural genius made it click. The common man always <br />appreciated classical music provided it was sung right - MKT's <br />euphoric Manmada leelayai vendraar was enjoyed at every street corner <br />in Tamil Naadu, by the same common man!!<br /><br />I give full marks to the fact that IR'background was very humble and <br />he did not have training or exposure to music. Yes definitely he <br />stands apart in that regard. But regardless of how much of training <br />and exposure you have , making a break in movies is very hard and <br />even harder to sustain. In other words nobody makes it just because <br />they are talented - with or without background.<br /><br />More on specifics on music later, or it will be too much for one post!<br /><br />MAlathi<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Malathi,<br />  We are talking about talent not about the philanthropic activities <br />of people<br />  in the Cine field.

Again I will tell you <br />the<br />  difference in cricketing terms &#40;In which I am at home&#41; In olden <br />days Leg<br />  Glance or Flick is played when the ball is pitching on leg stump <br />and leaving<br />  the leg stump. Playing that shot is not everybody&#39;s forte. Few <br />played it<br />  well.<br />  <br />  But it was GR Vishwanath who re-defined the flick / leg glance. <br />Even if the<br />  ball pitches on off stump and moves towards middle stump he would <br />flick the<br />  ball and it will run to boundary. He would do this effortlessly .<br />  Improvisation at its best. Defying the grammar of music I have given<br />  examples in my earlier posy\t.<br />  <br />  Similarly late cut between Wicket Keeper and 1st slip / 1st slip <br />and 2nd<br />  slip / Slip and Gully. All these need little variation in his hand <br />grip,<br />  open the face of the bat and timing. Similarly moving from one Raga <br />to<br />  another Rage and then coming back to the rage where he started -- <br />IR is a<br />  master in that.<br />  <br />  Vishy use to play shots in a area where there is no fielder.

KVM helped many younger musicians without <br />his name<br />    mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn <br />helped several<br />    people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at <br />all and he<br />    sang many of his own songs since he could not afford playback <br />singers, he<br />    was a very good singer but in spite of that. In fact it was SPB <br />who erected<br />    a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently.  <br />Ghantasala<br />    died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the <br />very last day.<br />    Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar.

He used this knowledge and fused them together <br />when he<br />    composed songs.<br />   <br />    For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal <br />training in<br />    music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in <br />his pocket,<br />    analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying <br />them to film<br />    music ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than <br />done. If I<br />    start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this <br />forum.

The piece starts off with the V &#40;Dm&#41; and then <br />resolves<br />      to the<br />              tonic &#40;Gm&#41;<br />                at the very beginning &#40;Madai Thiranthu&#41;. I find this<br />      interesting<br />              because<br />                usually, people start off a song with the tonic and <br />usually<br />          follow<br />              some<br />                chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again <br />towards<br />      the<br />          end.<br />               <br />               <br />                2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - <br />III - V<br />          &#40;nice..<br />              different<br />                from the usual I-IV-V.<br />               <br />                3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />          &#40;Ninaiththathu<br />                paLiththathu&#41; .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which <br />follows a I-<br />      III-<br />          V-IV-<br />              VII<br />                resolving to I at the next stanza.<br />               <br />                4.

			<div class="content">Udanx,<br />Â Hai Hai, why woudn't anyone be so inspired when they get the kind of payments he got??? IJokes aside, it is impossible for anyone to make music unless they enjoyed it and were good at it, am not discounting that - but whatI mean by hard work is the sheer logistics, getting the orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the songs in said time, and so on. IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and pressure, a creative director acknowledges these difficulties and limits his projects. My point jumps back in from the window <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br />Â <br />Yeah at one point of time he didnt' have a lot of money, at one point of time most film personalites did not have a lot of money - movie stars, music directors all of them especailly in those days. Ghantasala came to Chennai with one shirtÂ , 2 rupeesÂ and one leg with a limp due to a gunshot in afreedom struggle.MSV lost both his parents and suffered great poverty before he made it. Â Just saying he is not the only one with humble origins saar <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br />Â <br />I did not dispute his taste in classical musicÂ or anything personal like having concerts at home.Â Using classical ragas is common with every musicdirector since the dawn of time -Almost all his predecssors did and did soextremely well. Edhavadhu oru ragam edungalen, pappom? You said sindhu bhairavi right? Starting with MKT's vadaname chandra bimbamo(sivakavi, GR), Rajeswara Rao's Mayame Naan Ariyen (Missiamma), MSV's yennai yaar endru (paalum pazhamum), Sitthamellam enakku siva mayame (Thirvarutchelvar) - how manysindhu bhairavis you need? Balamurai, Semmangudi, ellarum greats dhaan. Aana kakka pudikkal asaamis to the core. To me anyway that is not important. IR knows some classical music and has some great compositions. People before him also had their share of that, whether or not the Balamuralis and Semmangudis accepted them is immaterial. That is all. <br />Â <br />Kadasiya let us get it straight.Â Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunnathat is perfectly fine. Everyone has their favorites and undoubtedly the guy is a great musician. The main point I disagree with you is that his predecessors were somehow secondary or inferior to him. Every man's sucess is acombination of talent and right timing. He had both. Lots of his predecessors have done yeoman contributions to the rich world of music.Â We have tohonor and accept everyone in the hall of fame.Â That is all. <br />Â <br />Ennoda email rules follow panreengalo illayo, paravallai. Aana half mirugathoda manushiya modha naan virumbalai, logical illaya??:) Apparam varra sattham definite IR music madhiri irukkaadhu, ellarum odi do vaanga <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) Good day!!<br />Â <br />MalathiÂ <br />Â <br />Â <br />Â <br /><br /><br />--- On Thu, 9/11/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Thursday, September 11, 2008, 10:08 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malati,<br /><br /><br />My reply inline in BLUE<br /><br /><br />On Fri, Sep 12, 2008 at 4:22 AM, dmaloo  wrote: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Udanx, I mentioned philanthropic acts in honor of those because of <br />their dedication to music even when very little money was involved. <br />You cannot discount the money factor since composing music is very <br />hard work and very difficult to do when money involved is less.<br /><br /><br />Â <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Composing music is hard work ...

But what interested me in the topic is the<br />true joy to the creator in the composition. <br /><br />- Is it his personal joy on creating a masterpiece ( in sculpture - i<br />would say the kind that the ajanta artist would have felt - his art<br />was not much exhibitionist but reflected perfection), <br /><br />- Is it the reward he got for his work ( like the mallai artist -<br />hosted by the artist kings of the great pallava clan)<br /><br />- Is it the appreciation he got for his work - worldwide acclaim -<br />sadly no sculpture signed his work - the fame went to the king or the<br />donor. so cant see parallels there.<br /><br />A direct question that rises from this is, why did the superb art of<br />sculpture vane - lack of talent, lack of motivation,lack of patrons<br />/reward, lack of appreciators.<br /><br />If we can identify the above, maybe we can try and find the cure.<br /><br />rgds<br />vj<br />-- <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.poetryinstone.in">http://www.poetryinstone.in</a><!-- m --><br />Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man</div>

			<div class="content">Malati,<br /><br /><br />IR knows some classical music<br /><br /><br />That was a very strong statement. Great insult! Find attached the XL sheet<br />which I am preparing on the compositions of Raja. As I said this is<br />incomplete. Need to do a lot of work. But as they say in Tamizh "Oru Paanai<br />Sotrukku oru Soru Padam" Trust this sample size will make you understand<br />what depth of knowledge he has got. Tell me one music director who tried all<br />these ragas?<br /><br />I am not putting the previous generation music directors in Tier 2. When did<br />I say that? Since Sunil Gavaskar plays perfect Copy book shot, and not<br />innovation shots like flick / late cut / square cut can I place him as a<br />Tier 2 batsman. He is also up there. But my point was there is joy when you<br />watch Vishy which is lacking in Sunil Gavaskar. When Gavasakar plays a shot<br />he needs to run and he doesnt hesitate to run. But ask Vishy fans how to<br />play a square cut. They will imitate the shot and also raise their left<br />hand! Reason, He is informing his partner, dont bother to run mate, it will<br />reach the boundary. Sheer pleasure and that to classic. Not Cheap thrill!<br /><br /><br />orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the<br />songs in said time<br /><br /><br />Have you ever heard of Raja failing his dates. Never. More over he never<br />plays the tune in his harmonium / key board or for that matter any<br />instrument. He listens to the situation and coposes tuens - Writes the notes<br />for the song. He never plays a tune in harmonium or any other instrument.<br />For IR to compose music he doesnt need any instrument just a A4 size paper<br />is enough. All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them!<br />This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they<br />cant play even after that then they are not musicians.<br /><br />If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music<br />and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym> -<br />Tiruvasagam Symphony, had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As<br />usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments.<br />He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer<br />room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the<br />music which was being played down by the musicians didn't tally with the<br />notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to<br />visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300<br />musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!<br /><br /><br />Using classical ragas is common with every music director since the dawn of<br />time<br /><br /><br />Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song,<br />situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in<br />"Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai<br />Yezhudum Neramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people<br />in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the<br />name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted<br />"Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR<br />its is not yedavadhu oru raagam ..<br /><br /><br />IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and<br />pressure<br /><br /><br />In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on<br />the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja" from<br />"Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu" from the movie "Indru Nee<br />Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie "Poonthota Kavalkaran" are<br />all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!<br /><br /><br />Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunna that is perfectly fine<br /><br /><br />I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV's<br />songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid<br />/ Laxman. They are all good batsman no doubt and I agree. But the pleasure<br />in watching Vishy is simply missing in others. People who have watched Vishy<br />play will agree to what I say.<br /><br />~ Udanx<br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>
