			<div class="content">The Lemurian (& Atlantis) continent was super developed by the time <br />the reminder of the world was seen to even discovering fire. <br /><br />the earlier discussion on this also discussed ice ages.<br />the period that many claim to have a civilisation ,we should also <br />analyse if the ice covered the continents.<br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>We can only produce logical conclusions for these facts. For ex: <br />Darwins theory, It is my personal opinion &#40;along with many religious</div></blockquote>sects) that the theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a <br />layman would be, if Man was to have come from the monkey, why are <br />monkeys not becoming men any more? Geological environmental <br />situations ? I would not buy that. So how does this context relate <br />with Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that creations <br />has been simultaneous and not based out of migration from one land to <br />another(which is a by product at some places). Human evolution has <br />been spontaneous and there are always super humans and normal / under <br />evolved humans on earth. Comparitively, New york is more developed <br />than a remote village in Africa or the aborginees of australia. In <br />about a few thousand years later, when the world graphics change and <br />it reconstructs itself (as it did during the ice age), there may be a <br />place where the future archeologists will<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>find that we did not exist and the native australians were the <br />first ones to figure out farming. <br />  <br />  Again this is a theory and logical. There are relative figuratives <br />when we look to religion to side with this theory though. for ex:</div></blockquote>those who believe in hinduism can say that Super humans (persons like <br />Rama / ravana etc) coexisted with humans ( common men / sages etc) <br />and super evolved animals (hanuman etc). In short creation has been <br />spontanic and there is no practical timeline to adjudicate the fact <br />that this event happened only at this point in time etc. These are <br />guidelines for this era. Creation (shristi) has been simultaneous and <br />we are only working on a sequential program once we figure out the <br />non sequential process of creation it will give various answers to <br />unsolved mysteries.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hence, according to me, the real origins of physical findings on <br />1st tamil sangam are a very difficult pill to swallow. There can be</div></blockquote>only logical conclusions. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I will try and attach some old scriptings on languages for <br />references.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote: When we talk of dating pre</div></blockquote>historic ( i mean known history)events <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>like lemuria we should also see the parallel development of mankind<br />   <br />  wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments of an <br />advancing <br />  civilisation.<br />   <br />  Most historians regard the wheel as one of the oldest and most <br />  important inventions, which originated in ancient Sumer in <br />  Mesopotamia &#40;modern Iraq&#41; in the 5th millennium BC, originally in <br />the <br />  function of potter&#39;s wheels. The wheel reached India and Pakistan <br />  with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd millennium BC<br />   <br />  so did lemuria function with out a wheel?<br />   <br />  LEMURIA<br />   <br />  Geologists today regard sunken continents as physical <br />  impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of continental <br />  plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.<br />   <br />  Though the living modern lemurs are only found in Madagascar and <br />  several surrounding islands, the biogeography of extinct lemurs <br />  extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the name Lemuria, <br />which <br />  was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater in an article <br />"The <br />  Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of Science. <br />Puzzled <br />  by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India, but <br />  not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed that <br />Madagascar <br />  and India had once been part of a larger continent, which he named <br />  "Lemuria" for its lemurs.<br />   <br />  Sclater&#39;s theory was hardly unusual for his time. The acceptance <br />of <br />  Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species <br />  from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to the acceptance <br />of <br />  continental drift, biologists frequently postulated submerged land <br />  masses in order to account for populations of land-based species <br />now <br />  separated by barriers of water. <br />   <br />  In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research vessel in the <br />  Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a continent about a <br />third <br />  of the size of Australia sank about 20 million years ago. Samples <br />  showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90 million-year-old <br />  sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity of dinosaur <br />fossil <br />  evidence and will help to understand the breakup of the Indian and <br />  Australian land masses; it does not support the concept of Lemuria <br />OF <br />  6TH MILLIENIUM BC<br />   <br />  regards<br />  venketesh<br />   <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  wrote:<br />   <br />    Hello<br />    <br />    Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of <br />Mathura&#39;s <br />  destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where Mt.Meru is &#40; a <br />  philosophical quote&#41;. <br />    The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis to Sanskrit is <br />  somewhat known. Veeramahendra puram and Elangai &#40;depicted in the <br />  legends&#41; seem to have association with the 1st tamil sangam. Ages <br />of <br />  those are into the treta yuga and earlier to it dating the 1st to <br />be <br />  atleast 6000 yrs BC. <br />    <br />    -- Ravi<br />    <br />    "G.

			<div class="content">Precisely, sinking of the super continents in sync with (Noah arc / Macha avatar whatever ) alterations of land mass and geographic patterns prompting an ice age. I still believe humans lived across the earth and only the super humans were able to communicate effectively by remote means.<br /><br />"R.venketesh"  wrote: The Lemurian (& Atlantis) continent was super developed by the time<br />the reminder of the world was seen to even discovering fire.<br /><br />the earlier discussion on this also discussed ice ages.<br />the period that many claim to have a civilisation ,we should also<br />analyse if the ice covered the continents.<br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>We can only produce logical conclusions for these facts. For ex:<br />Darwins theory, It is my personal opinion &#40;along with many religious</div></blockquote>sects) that the theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a<br />layman would be, if Man was to have come from the monkey, why are<br />monkeys not becoming men any more? Geological environmental<br />situations ? I would not buy that. So how does this context relate<br />with Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that creations<br />has been simultaneous and not based out of migration from one land to<br />another(which is a by product at some places). Human evolution has<br />been spontaneous and there are always super humans and normal / under<br />evolved humans on earth. Comparitively, New york is more developed<br />than a remote village in Africa or the aborginees of australia. In<br />about a few thousand years later, when the world graphics change and<br />it reconstructs itself (as it did during the ice age), there may be a<br />place where the future archeologists will<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>find that we did not exist and the native australians were the<br />first ones to figure out farming.<br /> <br />  Again this is a theory and logical. There are relative figuratives<br />when we look to religion to side with this theory though. for ex:</div></blockquote>those who believe in hinduism can say that Super humans (persons like<br />Rama / ravana etc) coexisted with humans ( common men / sages etc)<br />and super evolved animals (hanuman etc). In short creation has been<br />spontanic and there is no practical timeline to adjudicate the fact<br />that this event happened only at this point in time etc. These are<br />guidelines for this era. Creation (shristi) has been simultaneous and<br />we are only working on a sequential program once we figure out the<br />non sequential process of creation it will give various answers to<br />unsolved mysteries.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hence, according to me, the real origins of physical findings on<br />1st tamil sangam are a very difficult pill to swallow. There can be</div></blockquote>only logical conclusions.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I will try and attach some old scriptings on languages for<br />references.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  "R.venketesh" <br />wrote: When we talk of dating pre</div></blockquote>historic ( i mean known history)events<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>like lemuria we should also see the parallel development of mankind<br /> <br />  wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments of an<br />advancing<br />  civilisation.<br /> <br />  Most historians regard the wheel as one of the oldest and most<br />  important inventions, which originated in ancient Sumer in<br />  Mesopotamia &#40;modern Iraq&#41; in the 5th millennium BC, originally in<br />the<br />  function of potter&#39;s wheels. The wheel reached India and Pakistan<br />  with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd millennium BC<br /> <br />  so did lemuria function with out a wheel?<br /> <br />  LEMURIA<br /> <br />  Geologists today regard sunken continents as physical<br />  impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of continental<br />  plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.<br /> <br />  Though the living modern lemurs are only found in Madagascar and<br />  several surrounding islands, the biogeography of extinct lemurs<br />  extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the name Lemuria,<br />which<br />  was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater in an article<br />"The<br />  Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of Science.<br />Puzzled<br />  by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India, but<br />  not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed that<br />Madagascar<br />  and India had once been part of a larger continent, which he named<br />  "Lemuria" for its lemurs.<br /> <br />  Sclater&#39;s theory was hardly unusual for his time. The acceptance<br />of<br />  Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species<br />  from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to the acceptance<br />of<br />  continental drift, biologists frequently postulated submerged land<br />  masses in order to account for populations of land-based species<br />now<br />  separated by barriers of water.<br /> <br />  In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research vessel in the<br />  Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a continent about a<br />third<br />  of the size of Australia sank about 20 million years ago. Samples<br />  showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90 million-year-old<br />  sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity of dinosaur<br />fossil<br />  evidence and will help to understand the breakup of the Indian and<br />  Australian land masses; it does not support the concept of Lemuria<br />OF<br />  6TH MILLIENIUM BC<br /> <br />  regards<br />  venketesh<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  wrote:<br />   <br />    Hello<br />   <br />    Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of<br />Mathura&#39;s<br />  destruction.
