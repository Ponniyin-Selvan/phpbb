			<div class="content">Dear SPS sir,<br /><br />Thanks for this important info about the temples. During my childhood days<br />when we were playing in temple we used to hear stories and some history<br />about temples,that time some elder people told us that the shape of the<br />vimanam and the gopuram helps to focus the eternal power inside the temples<br />which will induce some vibrations and act together with mind waves to give<br />peace of mind and so many other things.....could you just comprehend this<br />one??<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R<br /><br />On Wed, Mar 5, 2008 at 6:06 PM, Sivapathasekaran <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "R.venketesh"<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />      If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof is<br />  enough.<br />    Why<br />      multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures?

May he be victorious, who is both sentient and motionless <br />(Sthanu), who is both undivided and the moon, who is both fire and <br />air, who is both terrible (Bhima) and kind (Siva), who is both the <br />cause of prosperity (Samkara and the destroyer of Love! <br />7. May Tarunankura be victorious, who is a king of kings, but is not <br />ugly (like Kuvera) who is am emperor, but does not distress people <br />(while Vishnu as both Chakrabhrit and Janardana) who is the lord of <br />protectors, but healthy (while the moon is the lord of stars, but is <br />subject to eclipses)! <br />(8 and 9) Just as in a large lake filled with water which is fit for <br />bathing, and covered with various lotus-flowers, handsome Samkara <br />(Siva) abides on the large head sprinkled with the water of <br />coronation and covered with bright jewels====of the illustrious <br />Atyanatakama who deprives his enemies of their pride, who is a <br />receptacle of wealth, who possesses the charm of Cupid, and who <br />assiduously worships Hara (Siva.) <br />10. He, desiring to attain the glory of Samkara (Siva), caused to be <br />made this lofty dwelling of Dhurjati (Siva) in order to procure the <br />fulfilment of their desires to his subjects. <br />11. Six times cursed be those, in whose hearts does not dwell Rudra <br />(Siva), the deliverer from the walking on the evil path! The temple <br />of Atyantakama Pallavesvara.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi SPS<br /><br />just a few questions<br /><br />what percentage of inscriptions on temples have been copied on to <br />paper in the major temples.<br /><br />are there any more temples which have inscriptions that are to be <br />deciphered.<br /><br />without the copper plates was writing the chola history to this level <br />atleast possible?<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, <br />"akumarg1976"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />  <br />  Dear SPS and Natarajan,<br />  <br />  Perfect reply.<br />  <br />    1. Whether Temples give History ?<br />  <br />  Inscriptions related to donations cannot be neglected just like <br />that. <br />  Any person who carefully analyses will find them as a source of <br />  treasure.

Temples do indicate EGO of Builder : <br />   <br />    Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />    constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />  one <br />    indicated here.<br />   <br />    Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive .. <br />    Involvement <br />  <br />  Mazhuppa vEndiya avasiyamE illai sir. You can very well say a BIG <br />NO <br />  as the fact supports your point. Installing king&#39;s sculpture or his <br />  palace in stone are easier ways to show his EGO than such massive <br />  experiments. These things clearly shows that our kings were NEITHER <br />  egoists NOR egotists.<br />  <br />  Kamal says &#39;Renovating a temple without affecting inscriptions and <br />  architecture is very much possible. The best example is <br />  Thiruvalanjuzhi. SPS is the eye-witness and can furnish more <br />  details&#39;. Please enlighten us.<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  A.Kumaraguruparan<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />        If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof is <br />    enough. <br />      Why <br />        multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out upper <br />    floor <br />        stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />      comparatively <br />        safer for devotees than multiple floors.

Whether Temples give History ?<br />    <br />    The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the temple. <br />SI <br />    inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, Valarau, <br />    Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based on <br />    these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.<br />    <br />    Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain <br />  more <br />    flattery.<br />    <br />    Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we will <br />  be <br />    left with only Literature.<br />    <br />    2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder : <br />    <br />    Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />    constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />  one <br />    indicated here.<br />    <br />    Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />    Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the gradeure <br />of <br />    the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, then <br />  may <br />    be EGO is not the wrong selection.<br />    <br />    Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <br />&#40;which <br />    Kalki describes&#41; and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood state?<br />    <br />    3. Single story / Multi-storied structure :: <br />    <br />    A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data that : <br />    <br />    i&#41; Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <br />  centres;<br />    ii&#41; Provided employment to several<br />    iii&#41; inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />    iv&#41; place of safeguarding food-produces<br />    v&#41; Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />    vi&#41; Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />    vii&#41; Presence of Government establishment &#40;as MANDRAMs were <br />    held under the shade of Trees only &#41;- linked the Village / <br />Panchyat <br />    with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />    viii&#41; Entertainment<br />    ix&#41; Associated with Educational Establishments <br />    <br />    <br />    4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in certain <br />    Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type &#40;like <br />    Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja <br />Perumal <br />    etc.&#41;.. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />    archieves.<br />    <br />    Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that <br />tall <br />    and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the Entrance <br />    also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / intrusion.<br />    <br />    This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam &#40;Siva <br />  run&#41; <br />    covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <br />  Narayana <br />    are the presiding deities and the devotees &#40;more than 100 in <br />    numbers&#41; commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva & <br />    Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and conclude <br />    Sivarathri night!<br />    <br />    Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.<br />    <br />    regards / <br />    <br />    sps</div></blockquote></div>
