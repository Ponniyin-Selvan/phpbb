Ragnarok is way ahead of Kulothunga I<br /><br />However, KL C I introduced some social reforms including the removal of Tariffs on many items, so He was Called as Sungham Thavirtha Chola and was very diplomatically handled the turmoil arised out of sudden death of Adherents which remains a mystry till today, which culminated in the end Tamil Cholas of Vijayalaya Line and heralded the Chalukya Chola dynasty in The Tamil soil.

No history , who did? who is responsible?<br /><br />KL is not a real chola King.<br /><br />So, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> is in diff height, pls don't bring KL here.<br /><br />Shankaran<br /><br /><br />venkataraman dhivakar  wrote:<br />Actually I wanted argue for Kuloththungan-1 as a greatest King we have seen in Tamilnadu History because he, the only King ruled under centralised system from Godavari south bank to Ceylon and also It was the country that time was the biggest (and also Hindu kingdom) over other kingdoms in India. And no doubt, he was a real emperor in his times like Samudra Gupta or Akbar.<br /><br />But Kamal's valuable points have changed my perception. KL has equalant qualities what <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> possess, but lacking in democratic process. Though he started the initiative for an independent ruling system in Madurai, he has not allowed the same in his paternal kingdom in Vengi and Ceylon where he appointed his own people as representative of him (like present day governors). <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> did not do this in Vengi and Celon.. He has handled the Vengi and Celon matters very very cleverly and this particular rajathandram is still valid. Here <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> scored over KL.<br /><br />At the same time, we could not blame KL for his handling of Vengi matters too because he wanted this country to be included as part of Tamilnadu. Had he succeeded in that effort, the coastal belt of present Andhra Pradesh would have been a pure Tamil country like Thondai mandalam. He has even sent quite a number of Tamil population during his period to settle in godavari and krishna districts. So, it was a worth try.<br /><br />Meykiirthis are valid points to consider as proof.<br /><br />"S.Kamalakkannan"  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Kamal<br /> <br />  that was a very nice justification. but arent we depending on the<br />  meikeerthi too much. meikeerthi is something they might have sung<br />  before the king himself daily. and our lands are known for<br />sychophancy<br />  thro the ages.</div></blockquote>Dear Venkatesh,<br /><br />Thanks for the reply. I was afraid that people may skip my mail<br />because of its length.<br /><br />Out of 6 points, only the first one talks about meikeerthi.

For the sake of argument, let us<br />assume that meikeerthi was sung before the king daily and<br />possess 'Uyarvu navirchi ani'.

Even if we assume the<br />entire meikeerthi as poikeerthi and do not count on the victories<br />listed, doesn't the polite words show his humanity?

			<div class="content">Dear Nanda,<br /><br />To be frank, Pandyan Dynasty, Kings and Country is very very ancient. Most of which is dipped in mystry and mythology. However full pandyan lineage has been completely described in Thiruvilayadal puranam written by Parnjyothi Muniver. Even many Names as held by the Cholas like Paranthagan, etc wer already kept by the Pandyans. U will be surprised know that Lord Muruga himself ruld the Panyan Kingdom as Ugra Peruvaluthi Pandyan and their History is time immemorial. Even lord Krishna's Sister or daughter by name Pandyya was married to the ancestors of Pandyans. Main contribution of Pandyans is that they were the first people to recognise learned people in the society by the way of organising the Sangams.<br />Beautiful stories and informations are there to discuss. let me see the response of members.<br /><br />G.S. Krishnan.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />i AGREE with most of the your email.. I was providing a metaphor and was not equating pandyas to roaches..<br /><br />Infact, in one of dr.Jaybee's email(not sure) I read that Angorwat is mostly pandya style architecture..Hats off to our anscestors..<br /><br />By trying to prove and compare who is the greatest, are we not trying to alienate each region individually..<br /><br />Balasubramani's email on the Hathikumba enscription, stated an alliance of tamil kings, but its like the Karavela has broken the same...<br /><br />Why is that we never had a person(eg. Bismark) who could think in terms of bringing the warring factions together to make a larger homeland?<br /><br />Can we not find the root cause for all this breakup and wars?<br /><br />We as a civilization killed ourselves in petty wars and petty fights that we have lost our place in the sun..<br /><br />coming back to the topic of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> being the greatest.. I am yet to be told of a single great pandya king(from 5th - 12th century AD).. Come on pandya naatu katrorare..<br /><br />Pallavas have left their glory in their temples all around Thondainaadu.. and even in the Sirapalli pillayar temple.. so who is the greatest of them all? Mamalla, Mahendra or Simha vishnu?<br /><br />Come on guys, I am expecting a lively competition here...<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Nanda<br /><br /><br />"R.venketesh"  wrote:<br /><br /><br />Hi Nandakumar,<br /><br />comparing the pandyas to roaches is like insulting ourselves.<br /><br />first- pandyas managed to maintain a clear line of heirs under the<br />most adverse of conditions.<br /><br />cholas did not go out in a fit of firing and glory. they just faded<br />away seeing before their eyes bits of their land being plucked away by<br />neigbours. the lethargy that set in after the great two and the<br />matriachial inheritance watered down their greatness.<br /><br />pandyas beat the cholas hollow, razed their capital to the ground,<br />destroyed all their monuments, excepting places of religious and<br />literary importance. and even melted down every chola coin with a<br />tiger. thats one reason why we find very few chola coins around.<br /><br />the turk was a great force from delhi. malik had finished off gujarat,<br />dwarasamudra, hoysalas, the warrangal rudras befor coming here. any<br />dynasty including the cholas at their peak could not have offered any<br />resisitance.<br /><br />it just happened the pandyas had to face him<br />however after the pandyas initially retreated they did come back under<br />vikrama pandya's leadership and drove malik off.<br />the pandya kingdom continued for another decade before the second turk<br />invasion finished them off.<br />venketesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Somebody said outlast the cholas..

Most of which is dipped in mystry<br />  and mythology. However full pandyan lineage has been<br />  completely described in Thiruvilayadal puranam<br />  written by Parnjyothi Muniver. Even many Names as<br />  held by the Cholas like Paranthagan, etc wer already<br />  kept by the Pandyans. U will be surprised know that<br />  Lord Muruga himself ruld the Panyan Kingdom as Ugra<br />  Peruvaluthi Pandyan and their History is time<br />  immemorial. Even lord Krishna&#39;s Sister or daughter<br />  by name Pandyya was married to the ancestors of<br />  Pandyans. Main contribution of Pandyans is that they<br />  were the first people to recognise learned people in<br />  the society by the way of organising the Sangams.<br />  Beautiful stories and informations are there to<br />  discuss. let me see the response of members.<br /> <br />  G.S. Krishnan.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />  wrote:<br />  i AGREE with most of the your email.. I<br />  was providing a metaphor and was not equating<br />  pandyas to roaches..<br /> <br />  Infact, in one of dr.Jaybee&#39;s email&#40;not sure&#41; I<br />  read that Angorwat is mostly pandya style<br />  architecture..Hats off to our anscestors..<br /> <br />  By trying to prove and compare who is the<br />  greatest, are we not trying to alienate each region<br />  individually..<br /> <br />  Balasubramani&#39;s email on the Hathikumba<br />  enscription, stated an alliance of tamil kings, but<br />  its like the Karavela has broken the same...<br /> <br />  Why is that we never had a person&#40;eg. Bismark&#41; who<br />  could think in terms of bringing the warring<br />  factions together to make a larger homeland?<br /> <br />  Can we not find the root cause for all this<br />  breakup and wars?<br /> <br />  We as a civilization killed ourselves in petty<br />  wars and petty fights that we have lost our place in<br />  the sun..<br /> <br />  coming back to the topic of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> being the<br />  greatest.. I am yet to be told of a single great<br />  pandya king&#40;from 5th - 12th century AD&#41;.. Come on<br />  pandya naatu katrorare..<br /> <br />  Pallavas have left their glory in their temples<br />  all around Thondainaadu.. and even in the Sirapalli<br />  pillayar temple.. so who is the greatest of them<br />  all? Mamalla, Mahendra or Simha vishnu?<br /> <br />  Come on guys, I am expecting a lively competition<br />  here...<br /> <br />  Regards<br /> <br />  Nanda</div></blockquote><br /><br />__________________________________________________________<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />I would like to argue to exclude Kulothungan I, as one of the attributes that qualifies to greatness is to leave a kingdom to their heirs which is stable, and allows then to expand and hence kulothungan cannot be ascribed with this yardstick<br /><br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> did leave behind a stable and wonderful launch pad for Rajendra to go about bringing down others.<br /><br />In this case, we can include Mahendra Varma Pallavan, infact of getting defeated or blocked by pulikesi, he did leave a stable and a launch pad for Narasimha pallavan to build upon. Also Mahendra as a patron of arts did well to leave such ever lasting monuments, that we can feel proud to be a tamil..<br /><br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br />ma eswaran  wrote:<br />Hi,<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>At the same time, we could not blame KL for his<br /> handling of Vengi matters too because he wanted this<br /> country to be included as part of Tamilnadu.

You are correct. I agree with you. But, fortunately, we have<br />  records from both winners and losers in very few cases. Why not<br />  from each and every loser? It is not possible. Because, losers<br />  will always think about getting out to normal life as early as<br />  possible instead of recording the happenings.<br /> <br />  Every coin has 2 sides. We thamizh people celebrate the victories<br />  of Rajendran. But in north india, he is portrayed<br />as &#39;Kollaikkaran&#39;.<br />  It is same as how we see Pulikesi. In case of Narasimma, there<br />  is no inscription in tamilnadu which states his vatapi invasion.<br />We<br />  know his victories only from the vatapi inscriptions.<br /> <br />  Another thing we need to understand is, all invasions need not<br />  be for wealth and expansion alone. It is also a duty for an<br />  emperor to ensure peace among his citizens and insist moral<br />  values among his neighbour kings. The article Pudhiraana<br />  pudhumai explains the reasons for all his invasions very well.<br /> <br />   <br />    In fact its mainly because of kalki that we dont get<br />    a real picture of the real <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.it is the image shri.<br />    krinamurthy left us which is preventing us.<br />   <br /> <br />  I think this is our failure to understand kalki. We should always<br />  remember that kalki wrote a novel. Not history. He talked only<br />  about Arumozhi. Not <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. All the incidents narrated by him need<br />  not be true. That is the freedom of a writer and kalki used this<br />  freedom to mix imagination in right proportion most effectively.<br />The<br />  varnanai &#39;Nilavai ponra mugam&#39; is not kalki&#39;s imagination. It is<br />said<br />  in Thiruvalangadu copper plates. The transition from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> fan to<br />  history student will happen only if we understand these.<br /> <br />  All the historians and scholars we have met so far, told that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym><br />  was introduced to them by Kalki only. And some say because of<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> only they got interest in history. That is the greatness of<br />kalki.<br /> <br />  Thanks<br />  Kamal</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Here?s a new way to find what you're looking for - Yahoo!
