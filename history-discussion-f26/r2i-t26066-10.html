			<div class="content">Hi Arun, I plan to go home sometime too, I originally<br />thought Bangalore but after a few visits I have<br />changed my mind, it will probably be Chennai.<br /><br />Bangalore is cosmo, more than ever now. Lots of places<br />to eat, if you know where to go you do get good food,<br />although pricey, shopping is nice, lot of variety, and<br />of course if you like pubs and that type of stuff<br />Bangalore always was like that.<br /><br />Safety, i would say no. Software engineers especially<br />are target of crime now, there is lot of theft at<br />knife point for cell phones and jewellery, and break<br />ins in separate houses. Don't go out late, or drive in<br />remote areas.<br /><br />Be careful, and any place in India is home anyway. You<br />will sure enjoy it for that reason!!<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- Arun Krishnan  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>*grin* wow.. some quite scary emails there..<br />  However,.

			<div class="content">i have nothing against bangalore - but some years ago i met a <br />traffic cop who was particularly rude....driving a TN registration <br />car, despite showing him ample proof that we had driven in for a <br />meeting and were returning back - the guy insisted to fine us for <br />not having a karnataka registration - the argument was - you want <br />jobs from us, you want water from us but tax you want to pay in TN ( <br />these were comments of an uniformed cop) - finally he let us go when <br />we threatened to capture what he said on the hp's video....the whole <br />concept of vehicle tax is a joke. anyway, go this as a forward, so <br />please reserve comments and look at just the funnier side..<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Time to travel from your house to your neighbor&#39;s house. &#40;a&#41; 2</div></blockquote>Wheeler - 4 years (b)4 Wheelers 700 Years (c) Big 4 wheelers - 3752 <br />Years (d) If you plan to park - Impossible<br /><br />There are no roads in Bangalore. Vehicles travel in the gaps between <br />houses. They fondly remember it as roads even though there is no <br />trace of tar on them.<br /><br />Even though India has opened up itself to foreign cars every house <br />should own a FIAT. <br /><br />Nobody knows the right way - so don't waste you time is asking for <br />directions - if you still insist record this on a tape and play it -<br />"sir, circle hogi straight madi - double road left hogi...circle - <br />you can play it on and on."<br /><br />It is the only place in the world where people drive 2-wheelers on <br />pavements. <br /><br />Tamil isnt spoken in Bangalore - even if you know tamil, its <br />indecent to speak in tamil. However if you still chance on someone <br />who does - its udrango ( i/o of kelambaranga)<br /><br />English is the only allowed language and has to be spoken without <br />exercising your lips muscle and Jaw bones - (eathen hunt would fail <br />in lip reading if he came to bangalore)<br /><br />Jeans ( ofcourse Jean is the only botton wear allowed and is formal<br />wear) are never to be worn above the waist - where exactly below <br />cannot be written in this. <br /><br />T shirts have to be two sizes small. Shirts have to be two sizes <br />large and checked ( export rejects from the inumerous factories <br />suppling to GAP and NIKE) - they should never be buttoned or pressed <br />( ironed). <br /><br />Irrespective of the occasion you have dirty sneaker and never mind <br />the weather ( bangalore has lost its cool weather long back ) <br />changes - you always need to wear a blazer or wind cheater. If its <br />too smelly just tie it around the waist.<br /><br />Commercial establishments are open 4 hours a day. They also break <br />for lunch for 4 hours. <br /><br />Any building with a glass faÃ§ade is into IT or BPO and will pay you <br />five times of what you would get in any of the other buildings ( not <br />that any work gets done in them either)<br /><br />Every other road has a medical college and two engineering colleges <br />( plus one cinema hall) - it goes wihtout mention that the cinema <br />hall has better attendance for a show that the colleges get per <br />semester.<br /><br />If dracula were to resettle I think he would pick bangalore - the <br />rule is for every hour you stay awake when the sun is up, you need <br />to stay up for 5 times that many in the night. What you do afterdark <br />cannot be written in this blog but can still mention that <br />kingfisher's Balance sheet could list Blr on fixed asset sch.<br /><br />Whatever you do afterdark, make sure you join the long list in front <br />of the various temples and pray profusely that God suffer from short <br />Term memory loss a la Gajini and forgive all your jalakridai of yore.<br /><br />The word punctual has been long martyed - You have to be atleast 2 <br />hours late to work, 21/2 if it's a lunch meeting, 3 if its dinner <br />and more if for any other formal occasion.<br /><br />All food should be consumed on road sides or in some vihars. All <br />sambars should be blood red but still taste sweet.<br /><br />Tea should be sweeter than payasam and coffee should make you throw <br />up. <br /><br />Houses should never be brightly lit and every inch of space must <br />have wooden furnitute. Rest of the floor showing must be covered <br />with the dirtiest looking carpet. Every window must have dark shades <br />and they should never be left open.<br /><br />In short living in Bangalore is like living in a foreign country, <br />with strange language and stange habits, but with horrible living <br />standards. <br /><br />But you still cant take two things away from bangalore - the women <br />and greenery. I think coversely something is genetically wrong with <br />women in chennai and same defect has manifested into men from <br />bangalore - they keep getting uglier.</div>

They fondly remember it as roads even<br />  though<br />    there is no<br />    trace of tar on them.<br />   <br />    Even though India has opened up itself to foreign<br />    cars every house<br />    should own a FIAT.<br />   <br />    Nobody knows the right way - so don&#39;t waste you<br />  time<br />    is asking for<br />    directions - if you still insist record this on a<br />    tape and play it -<br />    "sir, circle hogi straight madi - double road left<br />    hogi...circle -<br />    you can play it on and on."<br />   <br />    It is the only place in the world where people<br />  drive<br />    2-wheelers on<br />    pavements.<br />   <br />    Tamil isnt spoken in Bangalore - even if you know<br />    tamil, its<br />    indecent to speak in tamil. However if you still<br />    chance on someone<br />    who does - its udrango &#40; i/o of kelambaranga&#41;<br />   <br />    English is the only allowed language and has to be<br />    spoken without<br />    exercising your lips muscle and Jaw bones -<br />  &#40;eathen<br />    hunt would fail<br />    in lip reading if he came to bangalore&#41;<br />   <br />    Jeans &#40; ofcourse Jean is the only botton wear<br />    allowed and is formal<br />    wear&#41; are never to be worn above the waist - where<br />    exactly below<br />    cannot be written in this.<br />   <br />    T shirts have to be two sizes small. Shirts have<br />  to<br />    be two sizes<br />    large and checked &#40; export rejects from the<br />    inumerous factories<br />    suppling to GAP and NIKE&#41; - they should never be<br />    buttoned or pressed<br />    &#40; ironed&#41;.<br />   <br />    Irrespective of the occasion you have dirty<br />  sneaker<br />    and never mind<br />    the weather &#40; bangalore has lost its cool weather<br />    long back &#41;<br />    changes - you always need to wear a blazer or wind<br />    cheater. If its<br />    too smelly just tie it around the waist.<br />   <br />    Commercial establishments are open 4 hours a day.<br />    They also break<br />    for lunch for 4 hours.<br />   <br />    Any building with a glass faÃƒÂ§ade is into IT or BPO<br />    and will pay you<br />    five times of what you would get in any of the<br />  other<br />    buildings &#40; not<br />    that any work gets done in them either&#41;<br />   <br />    Every other road has a medical college and two<br />    engineering colleges<br />    &#40; plus one cinema hall&#41; - it goes wihtout mention<br />    that the cinema<br />    hall has better attendance for a show that the<br />    colleges get per<br />    semester.<br />   <br />    If dracula were to resettle I think he would pick<br />    bangalore - the<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!
