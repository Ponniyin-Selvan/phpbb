We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect..<br /><br />I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of Googling got me this :<br /><br />This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. FranÃ§ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England.<br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as:<br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/17/05, Vijay Veerasamy  wrote: Kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not complete fiction. He mixed fictious<br />character along with historical facts made <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br /><br />Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />shouldn't have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not<br />historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is completely based on<br />historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".<br /><br />Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to<br />disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.<br /><br />Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole<br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.<br /><br />So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All,<br /> <br />  Ok here&#39;s my tuppence worth. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a work of<br />  historical fiction. No one can<br />  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something<br />  like that, it is either<br />  out of ignorance &#40;which I don&#39;t think is the case&#41;<br />  or out of arrogance<br />  &#40;which might be the case&#41;.

FranÃ§ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment.

According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as:<br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/17/05, Vijay Veerasamy  wrote: Kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not complete fiction.

We can <br />  disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is <br />  wrong &#40;that is my own view of course&#41; but at the same time I also <br />  believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said <br />  that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death <br />  your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. <br />    <br />    I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of Googling got me <br />  this :<br />    <br />    This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is <br />widely <br />  attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal <br />  philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. FranÃ§ois-Marie Arouet &#40; <br />  Voltaire was his nom de plume&#41; was one of the most celebrated <br />  writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the <br />  Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were <br />in <br />  sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries <br />  twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to <br />  England. <br />    But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn&#39;t pen or utter the <br />  sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The <br />phrase <br />  was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It <br />  comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice <br />Hall <br />  and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. <br />  Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire&#39;s words in his "Treatise <br />on <br />  Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: <br />    Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life <br />  those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it <br />might <br />  be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,<br />    <br />    Arun<br />    <br />    On 6/17/05, Vijay Veerasamy  wrote: Kalki&#39;s <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is <br />  not complete fiction. He mixed fictious<br />    character along with historical facts made <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />    <br />    Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />    shouldn&#39;t have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not<br />    historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is completely based on <br />    historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />    Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />    Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".<br />    <br />    Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />    disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />    writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.<br />    <br />    Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />    doesn&#39;t make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />    world accept Tirukkural he wouldn&#39;t definitely be an<br />    arrogant.<br />    <br />    So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />    mass opinion.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    --- Arun Krishnan < drarunkrishnan@g...  wrote:<br />    <br />      Dear All,<br />     <br />      Ok here&#39;s my tuppence worth. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a work of<br />      historical fiction. No one can<br />      refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />      like that, it is either<br />      out of ignorance &#40;which I don&#39;t think is the case&#41;<br />      or out of arrogance<br />      &#40;which might be the case&#41;.
