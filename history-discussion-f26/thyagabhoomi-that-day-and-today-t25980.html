			<div class="content">Kailasam, very good subject.<br /><br />Thyagabhoomi was one of Kalki's most inspiring works, it is a <br />natural story of an orthodox brahmin family with the freedom <br />struggle interwoven very appropriately. The way the story <br />was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who lives <br />in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has <br />only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager <br />when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his <br />daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is <br />looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive man <br />who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and <br />Ponni (Kalki's standard rural pair:)) which antagonises his <br />relationship with orthodox brahmin community. During a flood he <br />opens his cattle shed and gives shelter to all slum dwellers and the <br />brahmins ex communicate him. <br /><br />There is a great dialogue in the cattle shed where cows talk about <br />human beliefs and caste problems. I am red and you are black but we <br />are still cows why these humans are like this, perhaps you have <br />horns, i have never seen a human with a horn they only behave like <br />they have horns <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) Kalki deserves an award just for that one <br />chapter <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />Sastry eventually finds a groom in Calcutta for his daughter, <br />Sridhar, an England returned handsome man. The family demands very <br />high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without knowing <br />his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is <br />very 'thudukku' or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from <br />her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime <br />is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally <br />dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the <br />village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He repeatedly <br />taunts Savitri for her village upbringing (to this day this happens <br />in NRI marriages!!). Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to Gandhian <br />ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the Mahatma's <br />cause. Savitri's in laws do not get any response for more money, so <br />one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a <br />strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her on <br />a train to a city near her native village. From there she again gets <br />some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The <br />house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some curious <br />new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy <br />faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.<br /><br />There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search <br />of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in <br />a 'kuppam' with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near them. <br />As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise her. <br />Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of <br />another rich woman (who ultimately is her aunt). But the woman takes <br />her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her <br />when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives around in <br />a car and speaks English. She asks Sastry and Charu to come and live <br />with her in her mansion (Sastry does not recognize his daughter <br />which is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of 'uruthhal' but perhaps she changed so much). <br />Sastry given to Gandhian ideals refuses but visits often with the <br />child who is very attached to Uma Rani's dog. <br /><br />Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british <br />girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive <br />from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper. <br />Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her <br />through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the <br />policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed out he <br />goes to Savitri's house, appeals to her to forget the past and <br />reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does not <br />she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then donates <br />her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra, <br />getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.<br /><br />That is the story in a nutshell. Like in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> it has some loose ends. <br />What about Chaaru, and Sastry? Sastry eventually comes to know Uma <br />Rani is Savitri but no mention of what happens to the child when she <br />and he join the freedom struggle. Perhaps she lives with Nallaan and <br />Ponni, perhaps her mother leaves her money, we don't really know.<br /><br />That is the story, as it was written, how would it be if it was <br />written now, more on that tomorrow.<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, laxmanan kailasam <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear members<br />  If kalki allives now, what will he write?

			<div class="content">A really beautiful summary! I have always admired Kalki's naming of his<br />characters.

The way the story<br />    was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who <br />lives<br />    in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has<br />    only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager<br />    when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his<br />    daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is<br />    looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive <br />man<br />    who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and<br />    Ponni &#40;Kalki&#39;s standard rural pair:&#41;&#41; which antagonises his<br />    relationship with orthodox brahmin community. During a flood he<br />    opens his cattle shed and gives shelter to all slum dwellers and <br />the<br />    brahmins ex communicate him.<br />   <br />    There is a great dialogue in the cattle shed where cows talk about<br />    human beliefs and caste problems. I am red and you are black but <br />we<br />    are still cows why these humans are like this, perhaps you have<br />    horns, i have never seen a human with a horn they only behave like<br />    they have horns <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41; Kalki deserves an award just for that one<br />    chapter <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />   <br />    Sastry eventually finds a groom in Calcutta for his daughter,<br />    Sridhar, an England returned handsome man. The family demands very<br />    high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without <br />knowing<br />    his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is<br />    very &#39;thudukku&#39; or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from<br />    her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime<br />    is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally<br />    dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the<br />    village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He <br />repeatedly<br />    taunts Savitri for her village upbringing &#40;to this day this <br />happens<br />    in NRI marriages!!&#41;. Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to <br />Gandhian<br />    ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the <br />Mahatma&#39;s<br />    cause. Savitri&#39;s in laws do not get any response for more money, <br />so<br />    one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a<br />    strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her <br />on<br />    a train to a city near her native village. From there she again <br />gets<br />    some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The<br />    house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some <br />curious<br />    new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy<br />    faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.<br />   <br />    There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search<br />    of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in<br />    a &#39;kuppam&#39; with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near <br />them.<br />    As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise <br />her.<br />    Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of<br />    another rich woman &#40;who ultimately is her aunt&#41;. But the woman <br />takes<br />    her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her<br />    when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives around <br />in<br />    a car and speaks English. She asks Sastry and Charu to come and <br />live<br />    with her in her mansion &#40;Sastry does not recognize his daughter<br />    which is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of &#39;uruthhal&#39; but perhaps she changed so much&#41;.<br />    Sastry given to Gandhian ideals refuses but visits often with the<br />    child who is very attached to Uma Rani&#39;s dog.<br />   <br />    Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british<br />    girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive<br />    from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper.<br />    Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her<br />    through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the<br />    policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed out <br />he<br />    goes to Savitri&#39;s house, appeals to her to forget the past and<br />    reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does <br />not<br />    she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then <br />donates<br />    her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra,<br />    getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.<br />   <br />    That is the story in a nutshell.

The way the story <br />  was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who lives <br />  in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has <br />  only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager <br />  when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his <br />  daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is <br />  looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive man <br />  who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and <br />  Ponni &#40;Kalki&#39;s standard rural pair:&#41;&#41; which antagonises his <br />  relationship with orthodox brahmin community. During a flood he <br />  opens his cattle shed and gives shelter to all slum dwellers and the <br />  brahmins ex communicate him. <br />  <br />  There is a great dialogue in the cattle shed where cows talk about <br />  human beliefs and caste problems. I am red and you are black but we <br />  are still cows why these humans are like this, perhaps you have <br />  horns, i have never seen a human with a horn they only behave like <br />  they have horns <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41; Kalki deserves an award just for that one <br />  chapter <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />  <br />  Sastry eventually finds a groom in Calcutta for his daughter, <br />  Sridhar, an England returned handsome man. The family demands very <br />  high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without knowing <br />  his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is <br />  very &#39;thudukku&#39; or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from <br />  her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime <br />  is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally <br />  dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the <br />  village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He repeatedly <br />  taunts Savitri for her village upbringing &#40;to this day this happens <br />  in NRI marriages!!&#41;. Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to Gandhian <br />  ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the Mahatma&#39;s <br />  cause. Savitri&#39;s in laws do not get any response for more money, so <br />  one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a <br />  strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her on <br />  a train to a city near her native village. From there she again gets <br />  some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The <br />  house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some curious <br />  new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy <br />  faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.<br />  <br />  There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search <br />  of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in <br />  a &#39;kuppam&#39; with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near them. <br />  As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise her. <br />  Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of <br />  another rich woman &#40;who ultimately is her aunt&#41;. But the woman takes <br />  her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her <br />  when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives around in <br />  a car and speaks English. She asks Sastry and Charu to come and live <br />  with her in her mansion &#40;Sastry does not recognize his daughter <br />  which is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of &#39;uruthhal&#39; but perhaps she changed so much&#41;. <br />  Sastry given to Gandhian ideals refuses but visits often with the <br />  child who is very attached to Uma Rani&#39;s dog. <br />  <br />  Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british <br />  girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive <br />  from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper. <br />  Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her <br />  through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the <br />  policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed out he <br />  goes to Savitri&#39;s house, appeals to her to forget the past and <br />  reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does not <br />  she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then donates <br />  her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra, <br />  getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.<br />  <br />  That is the story in a nutshell. Like in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> it has some loose ends. <br />  What about Chaaru, and Sastry? Sastry eventually comes to know Uma <br />  Rani is Savitri but no mention of what happens to the child when she <br />  and he join the freedom struggle. Perhaps she lives with Nallaan and <br />  Ponni, perhaps her mother leaves her money, we don&#39;t really know.<br />  <br />  That is the story, as it was written, how would it be if it was <br />  written now, more on that tomorrow.<br />  <br />  Malathi<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, laxmanan kailasam <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Dear members<br />    If kalki allives now, what will he write?
