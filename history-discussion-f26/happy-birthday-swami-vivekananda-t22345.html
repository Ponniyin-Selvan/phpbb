He and few of the core disciples of SriRamakrishna<br />took sanyaas only after the death of their master.<br /><br />Vivekananda's family continued to suffer.

			<div class="content">This is something i have never understood probably because i am a normal<br />person when compared to these great souls. If a person wants to search for<br />the ultimate for the rest of his life then he is definitely entitled to do<br />so and that probably what makes them great. But why do you have to get<br />married, bear children and the leave them to the mercy of this world. The<br />girl was married to this person as the girl's parents believed that he would<br />take good care of her. By becoming a sanyas or a rebel you are actually<br />making a whole bunch of people suffer (wife,kids,inlaws,etc,etc) and then<br />you are searching for god. God is in your duties..if you have not performed<br />your duties then how do you expect god to accept you?<br />Please note im not questioning the greatness of these souls or thier<br />teachings im just asking why do they make a whole bunch of people suffer<br />when they go after whatever they seek? Why dont they remain unmarried..earn<br />a small sum of money which would take care of thier parents for the erst of<br />thier remaining lives and then go and seek god.

He and few of the core disciples of SriRamakrishna<br />  took sanyaas only after the death of their master.<br />  <br />  Vivekananda&#39;s family continued to suffer. Swamiji spent some time much<br />  later with his mother - but other than that there was nothing he could<br />  do for his own family. When ramakrishna repeatedly asked to pray to<br />  mother kali for money, all young naren could wish for was knowledge<br />  and thirst for ultimate - not money !<br />  <br />  Same is the case with Adhi Shankara. He just came for the last moments<br />  of his mother and did her final rites<br />  <br />  Sri Raghavendra had to desert his wife who committed suicide. Later on<br />  he blessed her soul and that is what is today celebrated as "Sumangali<br />  prarthanai" after marriages. On that day alone, ladies eat first <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  and men eat later.<br />  <br />  Sri Ramanuja also had to desert his wife.<br />  <br />  This needs to be viewed with a different perspective of mind.<br />  <br />  Rgds<br />  Gokul.S</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">in case of vivekananda and buddha how do you know that they attained what<br />they searched for? how can you verify that they made the end justify thier<br />means?<br /><br />On 12/14/06, Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>During the freedom struggle thousands left thier families and went to<br />  fight for our country.

If a person wants to<br />        search for the ultimate for the rest of his life then he is definitely<br />        entitled to do so and that probably what makes them great. But why do you<br />        have to get married, bear children and the leave them to the mercy of this<br />        world. The girl was married to this person as the girl&#39;s parents believed<br />        that he would take good care of her. By becoming a sanyas or a rebel you are<br />        actually making a whole bunch of people suffer &#40;wife,kids,inlaws,etc,etc&#41;<br />        and then you are searching for god.

Just my<br />      two cents worth.<br />     <br />      earn a small sum of money which would take care of thier parents for<br />        the erst of thier remaining lives and then go and seek god.
