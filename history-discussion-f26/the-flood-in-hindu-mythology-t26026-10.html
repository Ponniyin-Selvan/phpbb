			<div class="content">Ravi, to me it does not matter if Krishna was<br />'physical' or not. Matter of fact the more we want to<br />see all these things like present day/in movies etc<br />the more of a hurdle it is to spiritual progress.<br /><br />The Mahabharat by the way is not a simple 'good over<br />evil' story as this movie shows or other movies show.<br />All the pandavas after they die go to hell. Duryodhana<br />is found in heaven, along with Karna and some others.<br />The consequences of what each person did manifests in<br />many different ways. To me whether there is a physical<br />'pralayam' or not is less important than whether there<br />is individual consequences which make it compelling to<br />live according to our dharma.<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- Ravi  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div><img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br /> <br />  Depends on which plane you view the Mahabarata or<br />  Gita from.

			<div class="content">Dear Malathi, I agree to your statement however, i still feel a <br />person of Hitler's magnitude or Osama's magnitude or industries <br />polluting rivers and global warming etc - will fall into the smaller <br />pralayam.<br /><br />When there is a negative soul (or a collection as in Kauravas) that <br />generates the energy to control elements of earth and other planets / <br />their influences on our worlds, that is when a larger cosmic energy <br />will balance the act.<br /><br />That is not possible for us to imagine in our meagre knowledge of the <br />Almighty in His full flow. The closest we can imagine is Lord Rama's <br />passage on earth.<br />How would we be able to imagine an earth bare of water dried up by <br />the Lord's spear? Yes - if you think only from a factor of spiritual <br />plane, that is easily deduced to Oceans of 7 samsaric births as <br />humans, physical plans - there is no law of physics that can explain <br />it. <br /><br />My thought process (may be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> biassed with religious materials), <br />fails to hail a person like hitler to equal with Kamsa or sooran etc. <br />Physical damage hitler did create, a soul like Sooran was a staunch <br />siva bhaktan, he generated so much of energy and soul power to rule <br />for thousands of years across so many galaxies. I doubt if a person <br />like hitler even had one micro granule of such soul power. Such was <br />the soul power of Suran - Tharakasuran - Sihamukan that Skanda toyed <br />around with him for 7 days (cosmic days may be equal to so many light <br />years) to show the Devas the power of Paramasivan's powers given to <br />His devotee, in fact by the second day, Devas almost think that Suran <br />is a greater force than the Supreme Himself. We all know how it ends <br />however.<br /><br />Anyway, long story short, these low faced criminals have no great <br />soul power to match the calibre of the Anti hero's in Asuras. <br />Anti hero is because, the increase their power not by mayic force but <br />breaking that shield and attaining boons by austere penances. I am <br />yet to see or hear such force for another flooded massive cosmic <br />manifestation. Well, Lord Kalki is due so lets hope that He does not <br />need to show up for a few of our younger generations.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "dmaloo"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Ravi, very well put!!!

			<div class="content">Ravi, very interesting points of view!! I agree<br />completely with you that the asuras cannot be compared<br />to Hitler, matter of fact very few of them could even<br />be classified as 'evil' all their acts were very<br />subjective, and that is often times what makes God's<br />reactions very difficult to understand. Ravana was a<br />great ruler, which is the reason why Sri Rama gives<br />him 'one more day' - indru poi naalai vaa. Duryodhana<br />was not 'evil' as we think, he was showered flowers<br />when he died. Sakuni was avenging the death of his<br />brothers by corrupting his mind. There is no evidence<br />that Duryodhana and Kauravas were bad rulers or mis<br />treated their subjects in any way.<br /><br />I find the Prahlada story inspiring among all since<br />Prahlada was a child and what was done to him was<br />child abuse. The other avatars are difficult to<br />justify from present day perspective. I think good and<br />evil are strongly dependant on cultures and living<br />standards of any given time. Even <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Narasimha<br />Pallava, great rulers as eulogised by Kalki had strong<br />elements of subjectivity to their 'goodness', we have<br />to forgive or ignore their acts of bloodshed and wars<br />if we have to respect them.<br /><br />So even if God wants to come as Kalki, only He can<br />perhaps understand why. One man's hero is definitely<br />another man's villain, not just in our times, even as<br />far behind as Ramayana.

We all<br />  know how it ends<br />  however.<br /> <br />  Anyway, long story short, these low faced criminals<br />  have no great<br />  soul power to match the calibre of the Anti hero&#39;s<br />  in Asuras.<br />  Anti hero is because, the increase their power not<br />  by mayic force but<br />  breaking that shield and attaining boons by austere<br />  penances. I am<br />  yet to see or hear such force for another flooded<br />  massive cosmic<br />  manifestation.

			<div class="content">It is our problem and more of a problem with our self<br />esteem. There are very few saints, because it is so<br />difficult to be a true saint. True saints rarely<br />advertise or perform 'magic'. Ultimately God is within<br />us, we have to have courage to believe that.<br /><br />A major part of the impetus for the atheistic movement<br />in TN to survive is belief of people in all magic and<br />fake swamis, instead of true self seeking<br />spirituality. Some people talk of Kalki like<br />christians talk of 'second coming', like there is some<br />big answer to the world's problems and it can end like<br />that. There may be, but really that is a little<br />escapist type of thinking to me. The only difference<br />is what difference we make, each and every one of us.<br />Or like Mother Teresa says we cannot do big things we<br />can only do small things in a big way.<br /><br />--- Humble Groups  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>If we are not able to find who is real and dupe, it<br />  is our problem,<br />  not dupe&#39;s.
