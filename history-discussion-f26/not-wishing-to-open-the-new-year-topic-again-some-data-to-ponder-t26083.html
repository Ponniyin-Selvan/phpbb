			<div class="content">Although I dont wish to open the New Year topic again, I found 2 opposing views on this subject in a Tamil related site. Some of our more knowledgeable members might like to throw more light on the views expressed here or at least on the astronomical data mentioned here. Which of these should a layman trust?!<br />Best regards<br />Sandeep<br /><br />1st one<br />by V.Thangavelu, President Thamil Creative Writers Association<br />Opposition has been voiced by a small bunch of individuals who are Hindus against the change in the birth of Thamil New Year. They claim the change is against tradition and borders on blasphemy. Such people are superficial and naive in many ways.<br />The opposition can be seen as an ad hominies argument you cannot fault an argument, so you fault the person advancing it. In this instance Chief Minister M.Karunanidhi! He is reviled by Hindu bigots like Thuglak Chow, Ramagopalan, Ela Ganesan (BJP) Ms Jayalalithaa (ADMK MLAs voted for the bill) and few others as anti-Hindu.<br />Strangely, the editor of the TamilNet website in his myopic arrogance and ignorance also joined the anti-nationalist force to whip up frenzy against the change. Thus making a mockery of the decision of the de facto state of Thamil Eelam that endorsed Thai first as Thamil New Year!<br />The Thamil Nadu government gave legal status to the observation of Thai first (January 14th) as the beginning of Thamil New Year which will be called Thiruvalluvar Aandu. In an unprecedented act of solidarity, the bill was unanimously passed by the TN State legislature.<br />The accusation the TN government has arbitrarily and suddenly made the change in regard to the New Year is not supported by facts. Only half-baked illiterates do so. Thamils need a continuous year count like the Christians or Muslims. They need to discard foreign culture and beliefs imposed on them under the guise of religion. Way back in 1921 Thamil scholars like Maraimalai Adikal, Naavalar Somasundera Bharathiyaar, Prof. Parithimaakalaignar (Prof. Sooriya Narayana Shastri) K.Subramaniyapillai, Thiru V.Kalyanasundera Mudaliyar, Saivait scholar Sachchithanadapillai, Naavalar Na.Mu. Venkadasamy, K.R.P.Visvanatham and scores of others met at Pachchayappan College and resolved to make Thai first Thamil New year instead of Chiththirai. In order to have a continuous year count the birth day of Thiruvalluvar was taken as falling on Thai (Suravam) first. This was given effect by the TN government in 1971 in official calendars, from 1972 in gazettes and from 1981 in all<br />departments. Later it was extended to non-governmental departments as well.<br />In the Indian civil calendar, the initial epoch is the Saka Era, a traditional era of Indian chronology that is said to have begun with King SalivahanaÃ‚Â’s accession to the throne and is also the reference for most astronomical works in Sanskrit literature written after 500 AD. In the Saka calendar, the year 2002 AD is 1925.<br />The other popular epoch is the Vikram era that is believed to have begun with the coronation of King Vikramaditya. The year 2002 AD corresponds to 2060 in this system.<br />The Calendar Reform Committee set up IndiaÃ‚Â’s present day national calendar in 1957. It is a lunisolar calendar, which has leap years coinciding with the leap years of the Gregorian calendar. The months in the calendar have been named after the conventional Indian months. This calendar came into effect with the Saka Era in Chaitra 1, 1879 (March 22, 1957).<br />Although we donÃ‚Â’t have direct evidence of ThiruvalluvarrÃ‚Â’s birth day, this day has been chosen with reference to available (indirect data) from Sangam and post-Sangam Thamil literature.<br />The opposition to the change in the Thamil New Year from Chiththirai to Thai mostly emanates due to a lack of proper understanding of astronomy. Added is the natural tendency to resist change.<br />The Earth has three types of motions: motion around its axis, motion around the Sun, and motion of its axis due to wobbling of Earth. The Earth rotates around its axis in 24 hours, which causes day and night. In the Northern Hemisphere we see that all but one of the stars and planets rise in the east and set in the west. The one star that does not rise or set is the polar star (Dhruv Nadchchathiram or Polaris), which is located directly above the EarthÃ‚Â’s North Pole. The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on the plane of orbit around the Sun. This causes changes of seasons during the year. The seasonal changes have nothing to do with star or planets as widely believed by Astrologers and Almanac casters.<br />The second type of motion is the rotation of the Earth around the Sun in 365 days to complete one revolution in an elliptical orbit. Using modern instruments for exact observations of the universe, the Earth takes 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 9.50 seconds to complete one revolution with respect to the stars (sidereal year). With respect to the orbit, it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45.50 seconds to complete one revolution (tropical year). The difference in time is 20 minutes and 24.00 seconds as follows: <br />Solar year,<br />365<br />d.<br />5<br />h.<br />48<br />m.<br />45.50<br />s.<br />Sidereal year,<br />365<br />6<br />9<br />9.50<br />Difference,<br />20<br />m.<br />24.00<br />s.<br />This difference is caused by the third type of motion of Earth, the wobbling of its axis, which astronomers call processional movement (precession of equinoxes) of the pole or axis of the Earth.<br />The ancient Thamils lived in close touch with nature. Astronomy and astrology very much influenced their lives. With regard to the year, the Thamils started it with the Vernal Equinox. Astronomers have determined the sun transiting Aries at 0 degree as the Vernal Equinox, that is the day when the sun rose exactly in the east, coincided. This was about the year 285AD. With the lapse of centuries, the New Year falls now, about three weeks after the Vernal Equinox. The Hindu solar year is sidereal, and since it is in excess of the tropical year by 20 minutes and 24.00 seconds, it does not keep step with the seasons. The seasons fall back one and half days for every hundred years or one day every 71.6 years.<br />It is not correct to say that Chiththirai has always been the beginning of Thamil New Year. Nachchinarkiniyar who wrote a commentary to Tholkaappiyam says Thamil New Year started in August (Aavani) and ended in July (Aadi). This demonstrates the fact that Aeries (Medam) is not the start of the reference point in the Zodiac during TholkappiyarÃ‚Â’s time.<br />The Thamils/Hindus divided the year into Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” the first six months after the winter solstice and Ã‚Â“DhadshanyamÃ‚Â” the second six months after the summer solstice. The former was considered health-giving, bright period for man and animals for during that period the days became longer and longer. Thus Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” was celebrated by Thaipongal and Paddippongal (the cattle festival). Most of the temple festivals in the Thamil country were also fixed for this bright period. The beginning of the Ã‚Â“DhadshanayamÃ‚Â” was marked by Ã‚Â“AdipirapooÃ‚Â” (July 1-Hindu calendar). These six months were considered not a very bright period for men and animals because the days became shorter and shorter.<br />One of the major drawbacks in counting Chiththirai is that it is not a continuous year. Its cycle consists of 60 years. This cycle of years is useless to record historical events. And their (so are some of the months) names are not Thamil. They are in Sanskrit. The mythological story attached to the birth of the years is extremely vulgar and obscene. As usual with Hindu mythologies a perverted mind must have invented the story.<br />A close look at the six seasons given in Thamil literature reveals that they are out of sync with the actual seasons experienced at the equator.<br />Ilavenil Kaalam : mild sunny period : Chithirai, Vahasi - Thingal<br />(mid April to mid June)<br />Muthuvenil Kaalam : intense sunny period : Aani, Aadi - Thingal<br />(mid June to mid August)<br />Kaar Kaalam : cloudy rainy Period : Aavani, Purataasi - Thingal<br />(mid August to mid October)<br />Kuthir Kaalam - cold period : Iyppassi, Kaarthihai - Thingal<br />(mid October to mid December)<br />Munpani Kaalam - early misty period (evening dew): Maarkali, Thai Thingal<br />(mid December to mid February)<br />Pinpani Kaalam - late misty period (morning dew): Maasi, Panguni Thingal<br />(mid February to mid April)<br />Definitely Mid June to mid-August is not the rainy season in Northeast of Ceylon or Thamil Nadu. They are in fact hot and humid months. The rainy season is from October to November (Iyppasi to Kaarthikai) and not from mid August to mid October.<br />The coolest months are December - January (Maarkali - Thai). It is in January (Thai) the farmer harvest the first sheaves of a harvest. They are grinded and mixed with old rice and used for Pongal. The actual harvest season does not take place in January. It takes place in February and March. This is due to change in seasons due to precession.<br />January 14th too has astronomical significance, in that, the Sun (Earth) commences its Northerly transit.<br />In fact there are four (not three) transits of significance by the Sun in its journey from south to north and north to south. They are: <br />Winter Equinox-March 20/21<br />Summer Solstice-June 21<br />Autumn Equinox-December 22<br />Spring Equinox-March 20/21<br />This is true only in regard to the Northern hemisphere. It will be the exact opposite of those living in the Southern hemisphere. When it is summer in the Northern hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern hemisphere. So in regard to spring and autumn.<br />As already mentioned, the arrivals of the seasons have been changing at the rate of 1 degree per 71.6 years. Westerners found spring coming earlier (March 10) than the Julian calendar showed viz March 21. To adjust the extra days Pope Gregory ordered the deletion of 10 days i.e. October 5th was followed up with October 15th. The Gregorian calendar still has a few seconds difference. But the calendar can hold good fairly accurately for the next 1000 years!<br />Due to the precession of the equinox, the Sun will be at the 1st degree of Libra at the spring equinox in 11,232 years! Those who think that almanacs and calendars are cast in iron should mark their calendars! The zodiac of the two systems (Tropical and Sidereal) will be exactly opposite one another! Ayanamsha will be 180 degrees 0 minutes!! It would be interesting to those who oppose Thamil New Year shifted to Thai first to incarnate at that time just to join in the debate!<br />In Vedic or Sidereal astrology the calculation of the Sun passing through the 1st degree of Aries is marked by the Sun actually passing through the observable fixed stars making up the constellation Aries and has nothing to do with the seasons. Because of the precession of equinoxes at a rate of 50.26 seconds per year, .difference between the tropical zodiac and sidereal zodiac increases every 10 years by 8 minutes 22 arc seconds.<br />The Thamil/Hindu calendar has gone awry and no correction was made for precession of equinoxes. This is the reason why the real seasons are not synchronizing with months mentioned above. Poet Subramanian Bharathiyar has pointed out this discrepancy in one of his essays.<br />Those who claim that Chiththirai New Year ushers in Spring (Venil) has to re-think. It really falls on March 21st! A good 24 days earlier. So are all the Hindu auspices festival and ceremonial days.<br />The Ã‚Â“wobbleÃ‚Â” and the precession of the equinoxes were known to the Ancient Egyptians, although the first official Ã‚Â“discoveryÃ‚Â” of it was made by an Ancient Greek astronomer, Hipparchus, who was born sometime around 190 B.C. It was noted because the Sun was in a slightly earlier position at the time of the Spring Equinox each year (as measured against the fixed stars). Because the movement slips backwards (Westwards) through the zodiac, it is called precession (as opposed to a forward-movement which would be called progression).<br />Now 1 every 71.6 years doesnÃ‚Â’t sound like too much, but it certainly adds up over 2,000 years or so, and this is where we get into the different Zodiac systems.<br />The determination of Thai first as Thamil New Year is now a fait accompali. One cannot unscramble a scrambled egg! History is heavily stacked against intellectually discreditable individuals for they live in the past!<br />The change of Thamil New Year has not altered or modified the Panchangam or Thamil Almanac as some foolishly think or argue. What has changed is the reference point (in a circle any point could be considered the reference point) in the Zodiac. Instead of Aeries 0 degree being considered the birth of Thamil New Year, the reference point has been shifted to Makaram 0 degree the birth of Thamil New Year!<br />There is reference in Thamil Sangam literature to the celebration of Thai Neeradal, but there is absolutely no reference to Chiththirai New Year in ancient literature!<br />The shifting of Thamil New Year from Chiththirai first to Thai first is a milestone in the history of Thamils.<br /><br />2nd one (which came ealier<br />Mr. Karunanidhi rushed through legislation in Tamil Nadu on January 29 to discontinue the observance of the April new year. The unspoken undercurrent was to de-Hinduize the Tamil calendar and assert Tamil NaduÃ‚Â’s separateness from the rest of India. He proposed that Thai Pongal in mid-January be established as the Tamil New Year instead.<br />Little did he realize that Thai Pongal itself had a lot to do with Hindu civilization. It is hardly Tamil to begin with. This Hindu holiday in January is celebrated throughout India as Makara Sankranti. Makara Sankranti, in fact, is the biggest event in the Kumbh Mela which falls every 12 years. It is the harvest festival in Tamil Nadu, not the traditional New Year! It never marked the start of the Tamil calendar.<br />A Ã‚Â‘Tamil NationÃ‚Â’ Op-Ed dated February 10 gave wide publicity to Mr. KarunanidhiÃ‚Â’s decision and urged that Tamils worldwide abide by the new diktat. A second editorial on April 12 defended the controversial move by M. Karunanidhi to shift the date of the Tamil New Year. It argued that the Tamil identity was reportedly secular, not religious. When even the pro-LTTE Tamil Net discreetly condemned KarunanidhiÃ‚Â’s decision, the Ã‚Â‘Tamil NationÃ‚Â’ website chose to defend it! It is ironic that while second-generation Tamil immigrants in Canada and Europe have understandably assimilated into those cultures, a UK-based website set up to purportedly defend Tamil culture urges those back home to disown the traditional Tamil New Year. The April New Year had been celebrated in Tamil Nadu for over a millennium and can not be vetoed by such politicized legislation.<br />Fortunately, the ground reality back in Sri Lanka is very different. The Tamils in Colombo, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Vavuniya observed the traditional Tamil New Year on April 13 with hope and prayer despite the difficult situation. The All Ceylon Hindu Congress clarified that the traditional Tamil New Year was in April, not in January. This followed public consultations. Tamil public opinion in Sri Lanka vehemently opposed any change to the date of the New Year.<br />KarunanidhiÃ‚Â’s efforts to bring forward the Tamil New Year to January had more to do with reconciling Tamil culture with the western calendar that starts on January 1. A so-called Tamil nationalism premised on the suppression of Hindu tradition can and should never succeed.<br />It was heartening to note that Jayalalitha Jayaram of the opposition AIADMK and Vaiko of the MDMK had condemned the move by Karunanidhi. This would likely be reversed in the next year. Sources in Tamil Nadu reveal that judicial litigation challenging the Karunanidhi decision is on the cards.<br />Regardless, the people of Batticaloa, Jaffna and Vavuniya can speak for themselves without the intervention of London-based websites.</div>

Which of these should a layman<br />  trust?!<br />  Best regards<br />  Sandeep<br /> <br />  1st one<br />  by V.Thangavelu, President Thamil Creative Writers<br />  Association<br />  Opposition has been voiced by a small bunch of<br />  individuals who are Hindus against the change in the<br />  birth of Thamil New Year. They claim the change is<br />  against tradition and borders on blasphemy. Such<br />  people are superficial and naive in many ways.<br />  The opposition can be seen as an ad hominies<br />  argument you cannot fault an argument, so you fault<br />  the person advancing it. In this instance Chief<br />  Minister M.Karunanidhi! He is reviled by Hindu<br />  bigots like Thuglak Chow, Ramagopalan, Ela Ganesan<br />  &#40;BJP&#41; Ms Jayalalithaa &#40;ADMK MLAs voted for the bill&#41;<br />  and few others as anti-Hindu.<br />  Strangely, the editor of the TamilNet website in<br />  his myopic arrogance and ignorance also joined the<br />  anti-nationalist force to whip up frenzy against the<br />  change. Thus making a mockery of the decision of the<br />  de facto state of Thamil Eelam that endorsed Thai<br />  first as Thamil New Year!<br />  The Thamil Nadu government gave legal status to the<br />  observation of Thai first &#40;January 14th&#41; as the<br />  beginning of Thamil New Year which will be called<br />  Thiruvalluvar Aandu. In an unprecedented act of<br />  solidarity, the bill was unanimously passed by the<br />  TN State legislature.<br />  The accusation the TN government has arbitrarily<br />  and suddenly made the change in regard to the New<br />  Year is not supported by facts. Only half-baked<br />  illiterates do so. Thamils need a continuous year<br />  count like the Christians or Muslims. They need to<br />  discard foreign culture and beliefs imposed on them<br />  under the guise of religion. Way back in 1921 Thamil<br />  scholars like Maraimalai Adikal, Naavalar<br />  Somasundera Bharathiyaar, Prof. Parithimaakalaignar<br />  &#40;Prof. Sooriya Narayana Shastri&#41;<br />  K.Subramaniyapillai, Thiru V.Kalyanasundera<br />  Mudaliyar, Saivait scholar Sachchithanadapillai,<br />  Naavalar Na.Mu. Venkadasamy, K.R.P.Visvanatham and<br />  scores of others met at Pachchayappan College and<br />  resolved to make Thai first Thamil New year instead<br />  of Chiththirai. In order to have a continuous year<br />  count the birth day of Thiruvalluvar was taken as<br />  falling on Thai &#40;Suravam&#41; first. This was given<br />  effect by the TN government in 1971 in official<br />  calendars, from 1972 in gazettes and from 1981 in<br />  all<br />  departments. Later it was extended to<br />  non-governmental departments as well.<br />  In the Indian civil calendar, the initial epoch is<br />  the Saka Era, a traditional era of Indian chronology<br />  that is said to have begun with King SalivahanaÃ‚Â’s<br />  accession to the throne and is also the reference<br />  for most astronomical works in Sanskrit literature<br />  written after 500 AD. In the Saka calendar, the year<br />  2002 AD is 1925.<br />  The other popular epoch is the Vikram era that is<br />  believed to have begun with the coronation of King<br />  Vikramaditya. The year 2002 AD corresponds to 2060<br />  in this system.<br />  The Calendar Reform Committee set up IndiaÃ‚Â’s<br />  present day national calendar in 1957. It is a<br />  lunisolar calendar, which has leap years coinciding<br />  with the leap years of the Gregorian calendar. The<br />  months in the calendar have been named after the<br />  conventional Indian months. This calendar came into<br />  effect with the Saka Era in Chaitra 1, 1879 &#40;March<br />  22, 1957&#41;.<br />  Although we donÃ‚Â’t have direct evidence of<br />  ThiruvalluvarrÃ‚Â’s birth day, this day has been chosen<br />  with reference to available &#40;indirect data&#41; from<br />  Sangam and post-Sangam Thamil literature.<br />  The opposition to the change in the Thamil New Year<br />  from Chiththirai to Thai mostly emanates due to a<br />  lack of proper understanding of astronomy. Added is<br />  the natural tendency to resist change.<br />  The Earth has three types of motions: motion around<br />  its axis, motion around the Sun, and motion of its<br />  axis due to wobbling of Earth. The Earth rotates<br />  around its axis in 24 hours, which causes day and<br />  night. In the Northern Hemisphere we see that all<br />  but one of the stars and planets rise in the east<br />  and set in the west. The one star that does not rise<br />  or set is the polar star &#40;Dhruv Nadchchathiram or<br />  Polaris&#41;, which is located directly above the<br />  EarthÃ‚Â’s North Pole. The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees<br />  on the plane of orbit around the Sun. This causes<br />  changes of seasons during the year. The seasonal<br />  changes have nothing to do with star or planets as<br />  widely believed by Astrologers and Almanac casters.<br />  The second type of motion is the rotation of the<br />  Earth around the Sun in 365 days to complete one<br />  revolution in an elliptical orbit. Using modern<br />  instruments for exact observations of the universe,<br />  the Earth takes 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and<br />  9.50 seconds to complete one revolution with respect<br />  to the stars &#40;sidereal year&#41;. With respect to the<br />  orbit, it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and<br />  45.50 seconds to complete one revolution &#40;tropical<br />  year&#41;. The difference in time is 20 minutes and<br />  24.00 seconds as follows: <br />  Solar year,<br />  365<br />  d.<br />  5<br />  h.<br />  48<br />  m.<br />  45.50<br />  s.<br />  Sidereal year,<br />  365<br />  6<br />  9<br />  9.50<br />  Difference,<br />  20<br />  m.<br />  24.00<br />  s.<br />  This difference is caused by the third type of<br />  motion of Earth, the wobbling of its axis, which<br />  astronomers call processional movement &#40;precession<br />  of equinoxes&#41; of the pole or axis of the Earth.<br />  The ancient Thamils lived in close touch with<br />  nature. Astronomy and astrology very much influenced<br />  their lives. With regard to the year, the Thamils<br />  started it with the Vernal Equinox. Astronomers have<br />  determined the sun transiting Aries at 0 degree as<br />  the Vernal Equinox, that is the day when the sun<br />  rose exactly in the east, coincided. This was about<br />  the year 285AD. With the lapse of centuries, the New<br />  Year falls now, about three weeks after the Vernal<br />  Equinox. The Hindu solar year is sidereal, and since<br />  it is in excess of the tropical year by 20 minutes<br />  and 24.00 seconds, it does not keep step with the<br />  seasons. The seasons fall back one and half days for<br />  every hundred years or one day every 71.6 years.<br />  It is not correct to say that Chiththirai has<br />  always been the beginning of Thamil New Year.<br />  Nachchinarkiniyar who wrote a commentary to<br />  Tholkaappiyam says Thamil New Year started in August<br />  &#40;Aavani&#41; and ended in July &#40;Aadi&#41;. This demonstrates<br />  the fact that Aeries &#40;Medam&#41; is not the start of the<br />  reference point in the Zodiac during TholkappiyarÃ‚Â’s<br />  time.<br />  The Thamils/Hindus divided the year into<br />  Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” the first six months after the winter<br />  solstice and Ã‚Â“DhadshanyamÃ‚Â” the second six months<br />  after the summer solstice. The former was considered<br />  health-giving, bright period for man and animals for<br />  during that period the days became longer and<br />  longer. Thus Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” was celebrated by<br />  Thaipongal and Paddippongal &#40;the cattle festival&#41;.<br />  Most of the temple festivals in the Thamil country<br />  were also fixed for this bright period. The<br />  beginning of the Ã‚Â“DhadshanayamÃ‚Â” was marked by<br />  Ã‚Â“AdipirapooÃ‚Â” &#40;July 1-Hindu calendar&#41;. These six<br />  months were considered not a very bright period for<br />  men and animals because the days became shorter and<br />  shorter.<br />  One of the major drawbacks in counting Chiththirai<br />  is that it is not a continuous year. Its cycle<br />  consists of 60 years. This cycle of years is useless<br />  to record historical events. And their &#40;so are some<br />  of the months&#41; names are not Thamil. They are in<br />  Sanskrit. The mythological story attached to the<br />  birth of the years is extremely vulgar and obscene.<br />  As usual with Hindu mythologies a perverted mind<br />  must have invented the story.<br />  A close look at the six seasons given in Thamil<br />  literature reveals that they are out of sync with<br />  the actual seasons experienced at the equator.<br />  Ilavenil Kaalam : mild sunny period : Chithirai,<br />  Vahasi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid April to mid June&#41;<br />  Muthuvenil Kaalam : intense sunny period : Aani,<br />  Aadi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid June to mid August&#41;<br />  Kaar Kaalam : cloudy rainy Period : Aavani,<br />  Purataasi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid August to mid October&#41;<br />  Kuthir Kaalam - cold period : Iyppassi, Kaarthihai<br />  - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid October to mid December&#41;<br />  Munpani Kaalam - early misty period &#40;evening dew&#41;: <br />  Maarkali, Thai Thingal<br />  &#40;mid December to mid February&#41;<br />  Pinpani Kaalam - late misty period &#40;morning dew&#41;: <br />  Maasi, Panguni Thingal<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage.

But whatever drifting is said<br />for Chiththirai 1 is applicable for Thai 1 also. These<br />dates are exactly three months apart. How can we fix<br />Thai 1 as Uththiraayanam without accounting for the<br />three weeks drifting (which actually occurs on<br />December 22 nowadays and not on Jan 14) and count the<br />drifting only for Chiththirai 1?<br /><br />BEWARE OF PEOPLE WHO APPLY MILK FOR ONE EYE AND<br />CHUNNAAMBU FOR THE OTHER EYE.<br /><br />(3)THIS POST OF Mr. V.Thangavelu SAYS: <br /><br />////There is reference in Thamil Sangam literature to<br />the celebration of Thai Neeradal, but there is<br />absolutely no reference to Chiththirai New Year in<br />ancient literature! ////<br /><br />A TOTAL FAULT!<br /><br />Iravatham Mahadevan mentioned that Chiththirai 1 as<br />new year is in accordance with Tamil marabu.<br /><br />Thai neeraadal is mentioned as neeraadal. Not as<br />newyear. But the six seasons of Tamilnadu with<br />applicable months were formulated by ancient<br />literature.

The first season is<br />ILaveanil and belongs to the months of Mid April and<br />to Mid June, Chiththirai and Vaikaasi.<br /><br />These six seasons are in the hearts of Tamil folks<br />including me. The four seasons of English or of the<br />North India never comes to my mind and also for almost<br />all Tamil folks.<br /><br />So Thai 1 as year beginning is against our ancient six<br />season culture as this splits one season into<br />two(munpani) .

They claim the change is<br />  against tradition and borders on blasphemy. Such<br />  people are superficial and naive in many ways.<br />  The opposition can be seen as an ad hominies<br />  argument you cannot fault an argument, so you fault<br />  the person advancing it. In this instance Chief<br />  Minister M.Karunanidhi! He is reviled by Hindu<br />  bigots like Thuglak Chow, Ramagopalan, Ela Ganesan<br />  &#40;BJP&#41; Ms Jayalalithaa &#40;ADMK MLAs voted for the bill&#41;<br />  and few others as anti-Hindu.<br />  Strangely, the editor of the TamilNet website in<br />  his myopic arrogance and ignorance also joined the<br />  anti-nationalist force to whip up frenzy against the<br />  change. Thus making a mockery of the decision of the<br />  de facto state of Thamil Eelam that endorsed Thai<br />  first as Thamil New Year!<br />  The Thamil Nadu government gave legal status to the<br />  observation of Thai first &#40;January 14th&#41; as the<br />  beginning of Thamil New Year which will be called<br />  Thiruvalluvar Aandu. In an unprecedented act of<br />  solidarity, the bill was unanimously passed by the<br />  TN State legislature.<br />  The accusation the TN government has arbitrarily<br />  and suddenly made the change in regard to the New<br />  Year is not supported by facts. Only half-baked<br />  illiterates do so. Thamils need a continuous year<br />  count like the Christians or Muslims. They need to<br />  discard foreign culture and beliefs imposed on them<br />  under the guise of religion. Way back in 1921 Thamil<br />  scholars like Maraimalai Adikal, Naavalar<br />  Somasundera Bharathiyaar, Prof. Parithimaakalaignar<br />  &#40;Prof. Sooriya Narayana Shastri&#41;<br />  K.Subramaniyapillai, Thiru V.Kalyanasundera<br />  Mudaliyar, Saivait scholar Sachchithanadapillai,<br />  Naavalar Na.Mu.

In the Saka calendar, the year<br />  2002 AD is 1925.<br />  The other popular epoch is the Vikram era that is<br />  believed to have begun with the coronation of King<br />  Vikramaditya. The year 2002 AD corresponds to 2060<br />  in this system.<br />  The Calendar Reform Committee set up IndiaÃ‚Â’s<br />  present day national calendar in 1957. It is a<br />  lunisolar calendar, which has leap years coinciding<br />  with the leap years of the Gregorian calendar. The<br />  months in the calendar have been named after the<br />  conventional Indian months. This calendar came into<br />  effect with the Saka Era in Chaitra 1, 1879 &#40;March<br />  22, 1957&#41;.<br />  Although we donÃ‚Â’t have direct evidence of<br />  ThiruvalluvarrÃ‚Â’s birth day, this day has been chosen<br />  with reference to available &#40;indirect data&#41; from<br />  Sangam and post-Sangam Thamil literature.<br />  The opposition to the change in the Thamil New Year<br />  from Chiththirai to Thai mostly emanates due to a<br />  lack of proper understanding of astronomy. Added is<br />  the natural tendency to resist change.<br />  The Earth has three types of motions: motion around<br />  its axis, motion around the Sun, and motion of its<br />  axis due to wobbling of Earth. The Earth rotates<br />  around its axis in 24 hours, which causes day and<br />  night. In the Northern Hemisphere we see that all<br />  but one of the stars and planets rise in the east<br />  and set in the west. The one star that does not rise<br />  or set is the polar star &#40;Dhruv Nadchchathiram or<br />  Polaris&#41;, which is located directly above the<br />  EarthÃ‚Â’s North Pole. The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees<br />  on the plane of orbit around the Sun. This causes<br />  changes of seasons during the year. The seasonal<br />  changes have nothing to do with star or planets as<br />  widely believed by Astrologers and Almanac casters.<br />  The second type of motion is the rotation of the<br />  Earth around the Sun in 365 days to complete one<br />  revolution in an elliptical orbit. Using modern<br />  instruments for exact observations of the universe,<br />  the Earth takes 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and<br />  9.50 seconds to complete one revolution with respect<br />  to the stars &#40;sidereal year&#41;. With respect to the<br />  orbit, it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and<br />  45.50 seconds to complete one revolution &#40;tropical<br />  year&#41;. The difference in time is 20 minutes and<br />  24.00 seconds as follows: <br />  Solar year,<br />  365<br />  d.<br />  5<br />  h.<br />  48<br />  m.<br />  45.50<br />  s.<br />  Sidereal year,<br />  365<br />  6<br />  9<br />  9.50<br />  Difference,<br />  20<br />  m.<br />  24.00<br />  s.<br />  This difference is caused by the third type of<br />  motion of Earth, the wobbling of its axis, which<br />  astronomers call processional movement &#40;precession<br />  of equinoxes&#41; of the pole or axis of the Earth.<br />  The ancient Thamils lived in close touch with<br />  nature. Astronomy and astrology very much influenced<br />  their lives. With regard to the year, the Thamils<br />  started it with the Vernal Equinox. Astronomers have<br />  determined the sun transiting Aries at 0 degree as<br />  the Vernal Equinox, that is the day when the sun<br />  rose exactly in the east, coincided. This was about<br />  the year 285AD. With the lapse of centuries, the New<br />  Year falls now, about three weeks after the Vernal<br />  Equinox. The Hindu solar year is sidereal, and since<br />  it is in excess of the tropical year by 20 minutes<br />  and 24.00 seconds, it does not keep step with the<br />  seasons. The seasons fall back one and half days for<br />  every hundred years or one day every 71.6 years.<br />  It is not correct to say that Chiththirai has<br />  always been the beginning of Thamil New Year.<br />  Nachchinarkiniyar who wrote a commentary to<br />  Tholkaappiyam says Thamil New Year started in August<br />  &#40;Aavani&#41; and ended in July &#40;Aadi&#41;. This demonstrates<br />  the fact that Aeries &#40;Medam&#41; is not the start of the<br />  reference point in the Zodiac during TholkappiyarÃ‚Â’s<br />  time.<br />  The Thamils/Hindus divided the year into<br />  Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” the first six months after the winter<br />  solstice and Ã‚Â“DhadshanyamÃ‚Â” the second six months<br />  after the summer solstice. The former was considered<br />  health-giving, bright period for man and animals for<br />  during that period the days became longer and<br />  longer. Thus Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” was celebrated by<br />  Thaipongal and Paddippongal &#40;the cattle festival&#41;.<br />  Most of the temple festivals in the Thamil country<br />  were also fixed for this bright period. The<br />  beginning of the Ã‚Â“DhadshanayamÃ‚Â” was marked by<br />  Ã‚Â“AdipirapooÃ‚Â” &#40;July 1-Hindu calendar&#41;. These six<br />  months were considered not a very bright period for<br />  men and animals because the days became shorter and<br />  shorter.<br />  One of the major drawbacks in counting Chiththirai<br />  is that it is not a continuous year. Its cycle<br />  consists of 60 years. This cycle of years is useless<br />  to record historical events. And their &#40;so are some<br />  of the months&#41; names are not Thamil. They are in<br />  Sanskrit. The mythological story attached to the<br />  birth of the years is extremely vulgar and obscene.<br />  As usual with Hindu mythologies a perverted mind<br />  must have invented the story.<br />  A close look at the six seasons given in Thamil<br />  literature reveals that they are out of sync with<br />  the actual seasons experienced at the equator.<br />  Ilavenil Kaalam : mild sunny period : Chithirai,<br />  Vahasi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid April to mid June&#41;<br />  Muthuvenil Kaalam : intense sunny period : Aani,<br />  Aadi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid June to mid August&#41;<br />  Kaar Kaalam : cloudy rainy Period : Aavani,<br />  Purataasi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid August to mid October&#41;<br />  Kuthir Kaalam - cold period : Iyppassi, Kaarthihai<br />  - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid October to mid December&#41;<br />  Munpani Kaalam - early misty period &#40;evening dew&#41;: <br />  Maarkali, Thai Thingal<br />  &#40;mid December to mid February&#41;<br />  Pinpani Kaalam - late misty period &#40;morning dew&#41;: <br />  Maasi, Panguni Thingal<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Did you know?

This calendar came into<br />  effect with the Saka Era in Chaitra 1, 1879 &#40;March<br />  22, 1957&#41;.<br />  Although we donÃ‚Â’t have direct evidence of<br />  ThiruvalluvarrÃ‚Â’s birth day, this day has been chosen<br />  with reference to available &#40;indirect data&#41; from<br />  Sangam and post-Sangam Thamil literature.<br />  The opposition to the change in the Thamil New Year<br />  from Chiththirai to Thai mostly emanates due to a<br />  lack of proper understanding of astronomy. Added is<br />  the natural tendency to resist change.<br />  The Earth has three types of motions: motion around<br />  its axis, motion around the Sun, and motion of its<br />  axis due to wobbling of Earth. The Earth rotates<br />  around its axis in 24 hours, which causes day and<br />  night. In the Northern Hemisphere we see that all<br />  but one of the stars and planets rise in the east<br />  and set in the west. The one star that does not rise<br />  or set is the polar star &#40;Dhruv Nadchchathiram or<br />  Polaris&#41;, which is located directly above the<br />  EarthÃ‚Â’s North Pole. The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees<br />  on the plane of orbit around the Sun. This causes<br />  changes of seasons during the year. The seasonal<br />  changes have nothing to do with star or planets as<br />  widely believed by Astrologers and Almanac casters.<br />  The second type of motion is the rotation of the<br />  Earth around the Sun in 365 days to complete one<br />  revolution in an elliptical orbit. Using modern<br />  instruments for exact observations of the universe,<br />  the Earth takes 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and<br />  9.50 seconds to complete one revolution with respect<br />  to the stars &#40;sidereal year&#41;. With respect to the<br />  orbit, it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and<br />  45.50 seconds to complete one revolution &#40;tropical<br />  year&#41;. The difference in time is 20 minutes and<br />  24.00 seconds as follows: <br />  Solar year,<br />  365<br />  d.<br />  5<br />  h.<br />  48<br />  m.<br />  45.50<br />  s.<br />  Sidereal year,<br />  365<br />  6<br />  9<br />  9.50<br />  Difference,<br />  20<br />  m.<br />  24.00<br />  s.<br />  This difference is caused by the third type of<br />  motion of Earth, the wobbling of its axis, which<br />  astronomers call processional movement &#40;precession<br />  of equinoxes&#41; of the pole or axis of the Earth.<br />  The ancient Thamils lived in close touch with<br />  nature. Astronomy and astrology very much influenced<br />  their lives. With regard to the year, the Thamils<br />  started it with the Vernal Equinox. Astronomers have<br />  determined the sun transiting Aries at 0 degree as<br />  the Vernal Equinox, that is the day when the sun<br />  rose exactly in the east, coincided. This was about<br />  the year 285AD. With the lapse of centuries, the New<br />  Year falls now, about three weeks after the Vernal<br />  Equinox. The Hindu solar year is sidereal, and since<br />  it is in excess of the tropical year by 20 minutes<br />  and 24.00 seconds, it does not keep step with the<br />  seasons. The seasons fall back one and half days for<br />  every hundred years or one day every 71.6 years.<br />  It is not correct to say that Chiththirai has<br />  always been the beginning of Thamil New Year.<br />  Nachchinarkiniyar who wrote a commentary to<br />  Tholkaappiyam says Thamil New Year started in August<br />  &#40;Aavani&#41; and ended in July &#40;Aadi&#41;. This demonstrates<br />  the fact that Aeries &#40;Medam&#41; is not the start of the<br />  reference point in the Zodiac during TholkappiyarÃ‚Â’s<br />  time.<br />  The Thamils/Hindus divided the year into<br />  Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” the first six months after the winter<br />  solstice and Ã‚Â“DhadshanyamÃ‚Â” the second six months<br />  after the summer solstice. The former was considered<br />  health-giving, bright period for man and animals for<br />  during that period the days became longer and<br />  longer. Thus Ã‚Â“UttarayanamÃ‚Â” was celebrated by<br />  Thaipongal and Paddippongal &#40;the cattle festival&#41;.<br />  Most of the temple festivals in the Thamil country<br />  were also fixed for this bright period. The<br />  beginning of the Ã‚Â“DhadshanayamÃ‚Â” was marked by<br />  Ã‚Â“AdipirapooÃ‚Â” &#40;July 1-Hindu calendar&#41;. These six<br />  months were considered not a very bright period for<br />  men and animals because the days became shorter and<br />  shorter.<br />  One of the major drawbacks in counting Chiththirai<br />  is that it is not a continuous year. Its cycle<br />  consists of 60 years. This cycle of years is useless<br />  to record historical events. And their &#40;so are some<br />  of the months&#41; names are not Thamil. They are in<br />  Sanskrit. The mythological story attached to the<br />  birth of the years is extremely vulgar and obscene.<br />  As usual with Hindu mythologies a perverted mind<br />  must have invented the story.<br />  A close look at the six seasons given in Thamil<br />  literature reveals that they are out of sync with<br />  the actual seasons experienced at the equator.<br />  Ilavenil Kaalam : mild sunny period : Chithirai,<br />  Vahasi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid April to mid June&#41;<br />  Muthuvenil Kaalam : intense sunny period : Aani,<br />  Aadi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid June to mid August&#41;<br />  Kaar Kaalam : cloudy rainy Period : Aavani,<br />  Purataasi - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid August to mid October&#41;<br />  Kuthir Kaalam - cold period : Iyppassi, Kaarthihai<br />  - Thingal<br />  &#40;mid October to mid December&#41;<br />  Munpani Kaalam - early misty period &#40;evening dew&#41;: <br />  Maarkali, Thai Thingal<br />  &#40;mid December to mid February&#41;<br />  Pinpani Kaalam - late misty period &#40;morning dew&#41;: <br />  Maasi, Panguni Thingal<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br />Did you know?

Astronomers <br />have determined the sun transiting Aries at 0 degree as the Vernal <br />Equinox, that is the day when the sun rose exactly in the east, <br />coincided. This was about the year 285AD. With the lapse of <br />centuries, the New Year falls now, about three weeks after the <br />Vernal Equinox. The Hindu solar year is sidereal, and since it is in <br />excess of the tropical year by 20 minutes and 24.00 seconds, it does <br />not keep step with the seasons. The seasons fall back one and half <br />days for every hundred years or one day every 71.6 years.<br /><br /><br />It is not correct to say that Chiththirai has always been the <br />beginning of Thamil New Year. Nachchinarkiniyar who wrote a <br />commentary to Tholkaappiyam says Thamil New Year started in August <br />(Aavani) and ended in July (Aadi). This demonstrates the fact that <br />Aeries (Medam) is not the start of the reference point in the Zodiac <br />during Tholkappiyar?s time. <br />========================<br /><br />THIS IS AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION..<br /><br />AVANI to AADI .. ! AS PER NACHINARKINIAR... !<br /><br />Deleting (Neglecting) the political stuff, this observation would <br />serve as a reference for a detailed study in the subject.<br /><br />thanks Thiru and regards / sps<br /><br />===========================</div>
