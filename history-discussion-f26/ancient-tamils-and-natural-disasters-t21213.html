			<div class="content">I was reading the tsunami news with shock.Tamilnadu has faced a<br />devastating disaster.I also read the news in different media.No<br />media carried positive reports.All was negative.For eg..<br /><br />Sun Tv--"TN govt failed to help tsunami victims.But central govt<br />only is helping."<br /><br />Jaya TV--"people thank JJ for timely help"<br /><br />Kumudam--This magazine curses sea.<br /><br />vikatan--gives tales of tear and sorrow.Tells about fishermen who<br />have quit fishing and have gone inland.<br /><br />From: this I only get the impression that people who<br />lost everything sit and cry cursing sea and their fate.I dont blame<br />them.If I had lost my children and spouse in sea I would have done<br />exactly the same thing.<br /><br />But I read in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> part 5 what kalki had said.He<br />said "people during chola days did not bother about floods.If they<br />lost a house in flood,they will rebuild it with vigour.Since<br />cholanadu had such valiant people chola kings could accomplish great<br />deeds"<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> also narrates how paluvettarayar fought the<br />flood valiantly.At the age of 64 he defeated flood and came back<br />inspite of a tree and a building falling upon him.<br /><br />That might be fiction.But i believe that this<br />is how our ancestors would have fought natural disaters.One thing<br />about our ancestors was sure.They werent afraid of death.<br /><br />Malayaman says in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> "I had six sons who<br />equalled arjuna and bheema.I lost every one of them in wars.I never<br />cried when they died".was this old man afraid of death?<br /><br />This attitude made our ancestors accomplish<br />great deeds.They very easily swallowed sorrows and deaths.They were<br />valiant and starred death face to face.They did not cry like our<br />media does today.<br /><br />Japan has had various tsunami and earthquakes.It<br />even had 2 atom bomb attacks.But they did not sit and cry.They<br />rebuild their country with vigour.Recently when hurricane Ivan<br />attacked florida, people of florida did the same thing.American<br />media never carried such negative report which our media carries.Our<br />media carries this report only"everything is gone.all is<br />lost.finished..."<br /><br />It seems that americans and japanese have the valiant nature which<br />our ancestors carried.we have lost it somewhere in the due course of<br />time.<br /><br />This flood has attacked chola desam and pandya desam violently.But<br />these countries are famous for their valour.after being enslaved for<br />400 years pandyas recouped and defeated cholas after losing<br />everything.They had such valour.<br /><br />Flood cannot destory our will.I read stories about fishermen<br />quitting their business and people waiting for govt aid(which will<br />never come).Lets take a leaf from our ancestors and face things<br />positively.why should fishermen quit thier business?are they afraid<br />of sea?<br /><br />Let us face things positively.</div>

			<div class="content">I was some 6 Km away from Poompuhar when the tsunami struck.. Initially, there were very vague reports of disaster and vehicles were turned back..<br /><br />On the way back to Mayavaram, I saw families walking with children, few possessions and even their cattle walking all the way away from the coast towards safety.. The scene was heart rendering. I was reminded of the destruction portrayed by Kalki in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in the wake of the cyclone.. and his words about the resilience of the people.. I came to know of the extent of the disaster later..<br /><br />He had written about the floods that once in a while Kaveri became very eager to join her lover "Samudhira rajan" and races towards him.. I guess that this time it was his turn..<br /><br />Times have changed.. but I believe that human nature is as resilient as ever.. I pray that people have the strength to rebuild their lives..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Vidhya.<br /><br />Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br />I don't think enough time has passed since the disaster for the people<br />to show resilience.

			<div class="content">Dear kamal,<br />I am not heartless to say that people who lost everything in tsunami<br />should not cry.They are common men,like most of us.I would do the<br />same thing if i was an unfortunate victim.<br /><br />I was only comparing the attitude of our current generation with<br />that of the past.You dont even have to go to the past to find out<br />how our ancestors faced death.You have to go 18 miles south of<br />rameshwaram-to vavuniya and yaalpaanam to see how our brethren there<br />face death.They face it more valiantly than us.There women and<br />children face death more bravely than the rest of the world.They are<br />equal to israelis and japanese in this aspect.<br /><br />Current tamil generation in tamilnadu is not the heirs of warriors<br />like paluvettarayars,rajadithan,rajendran and malayaman.Only the<br />eelam tamils can claim to be their decendents.we dont have that<br />eligibility.<br /><br />Our current priorities are washing cut outs of matineee idols with<br />milk and starting fan clubs for jothika and simran.we are no more a<br />civilization that produces great poets,warriors and businessmen.we<br />are a civilization that produces clerks,unemployed graduates<br />and "samanjadhu eppadi" type of poets.<br /><br />when i see eelam tamils,when i see how they preserve their<br />language,how they produce valiant warriors like prabhakaran,charles<br />antony et al, about how they produce poets like kasi anadan--i<br />understand how our ancestors would have lived.<br /><br />I would blame the media equally for this.Our mass media like<br />movies,journals,tv etc have castrated our youth.People like major<br />saravanan,abdul kalam are some cause for hope.<br /><br />Its not only unique to tamilnadu.If we see current orissa,would we<br />believe that their ancestors were the great kalingas,who even<br />challenged the mighty asoka and krishnadeva raya?<br /><br />If we see current biharis would we believe that their ancestors were<br />magadha kings like asoka and chandragupta mourya?<br /><br />Telling such people about how their glorious past and illustrious<br />ancestors,about how they faced death and grief,is not heartless I<br />believe.<br /><br />Tamil society will survive till eternity.But will it survive by<br />speaking english and forgeting tamil?will it have cinema idols as<br />its leader?If a civilization that had chief ministers like<br />anirudhar,sekhizar and kamarajar produces chief ministers like our<br />current lot and survives till eternity is that a cause for<br />celebration?<br /><br />But eelam tamils will protect our civilization.There is no doubt<br />about it.<br /><br />regards<br />sampath<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Kamal G  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Comparing ancient war victims with tsunami victims can not be<br />correct.<br />  u can compare ancient warriors with current army people fighting<br />in kashmir.<br />  they are equally good<br /> <br />  Donot compare us with Japanese & Isrealis ..
