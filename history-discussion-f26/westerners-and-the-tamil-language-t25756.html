			<div class="content">WESTERNERS AND THE TAMIL LANGUAGE <br /><br />K. R. Vadivale (CIBC Mellon - Toronto) <br /><br />In about 1730 AD, the Tamil Thirukkural was translated into Latin by <br />Fr. Beschi, one of the greatest European Tamil scholars. Rev. Beschi <br />an Italian Christian missionary who came to India learnt Tamil <br />grammars and literature to carry on his missionary work. He wore <br />saffron dress like sadhus and assumed the Tamil name Veeramamunivar.  <br />He composed the story of Jesus Christ in the form of an epic poem in <br />the name Thembavani. He also wrote a prabandham called "Kavalur <br />Kalambagam" and a grammatical treatise "Thonnool". He also <br />wrote "Vedhiyar Ozukkam" and "Paramarthaguru".<br /><br />Tamil is the most ancient of the languages now spoken in India and <br />belongs to the Dravidian family comprised of 23 languages. These <br />languages are spoken mainly in the southern part of India as well as <br />in a few regions of central and northern parts of India. The Bruhui <br />language of the Dravidian group is spoken at present in the <br />Baluchistan region of Pakistan near the river Sindhu. Excavations at <br />Harapa and Monhanjadaro in this region evidence the ancientness of <br />the Dravidian languages to 5000 B.C. The word Dravidian also <br />originates from the word Tamil/Thamil. <br /><br />The other classical languages of the world are Latin, Hebrew, Greek, <br />and Sanskrit. All of these languages contain Tamil words. This <br />shows the antiquity of Tamil. Further these languages are not spoken <br />today. There are a number of Tamil words found even in English, for <br />example the English words mango, cash, curry, catamaran, coir, coolie <br />to name a few, have Tamil origins. Tamil is recognized today as the <br />earliest language possessing an unbroken history of literary <br />production for the past twenty centuries. <br /><br />In the earliest times all Tamil literary works were composed in <br />poetic form. All books were written in verse. <br /><br />Tamil has its own independent script and literary history dating back <br />from the early pre Christian era. There are 247 characters in the <br />Tamil script, which may be condensed to 38-40.  <br /><br />With little change over the centuries literate readers can easily <br />follow the ancient works today. Christian missionaries working in <br />South India and Sri Lanka introduced printing and simplified Tamil <br />prose writing only in the eighteenth century. <br /><br />The meaning of the word Tamil is sweet, beauty and naturalness. This <br />word occurs in the Tholkappiam, the earliest text written work in <br />Tamil. Tholkappiam is a grammatical work belonging to the third <br />century B.C. In the ancient literature the word Tamil also denotes <br />the race, country, people and army. <br /><br />Tamil is rich in vocabulary showing subtle and minute differences in <br />meaning. For example, the word vaaymai denotes truth by words. The <br />word unmai denotes truth by mind (thought) while the word meymai <br />stands for truth by body (action). <br /><br />There are seven words in Tamil to denote the various stages of <br />flower from bud to dry flower. Â– wiz, arumpu, mottu, mukai, malar, <br />alar, vii, and cemmal. <br /><br />Many books become obsolete during the lifetime of the author, some <br />after a century; some others after a few centuries; but obsolete they <br />do become. <br /><br />Thirukkal as a book that deals with `the Art of Living', is gaining <br />increasing acceptance. It consists of thousand three hundred and <br />thirty couplets called Kurals each being an epigram, simple forcible <br />and at the same time captivating. <br /><br />It is said to occupy in the literature of world a place comparable <br />to the Confucian analects, Plato's dialogues, Aristotle's ethics and <br />Seneca's writings. <br /><br />The author of this great work Thiruvalluvar lived between the third <br />and the first century B.C. During this period, Tamil Nadu had wide <br />international contacts with countries ranging from Egypt, Greece, and <br />Rome in the west, Burma, Malaysia, and China in the east. A <br />representative of the Pandya King attended the coronation of Emperor <br />Augustus in Rome, as mentioned by Strabo, A Greek who wrote his <br />Geography in the first century AD.<br /><br />An arrestingly astute couplet of the poet was explained in English <br />to Dr. Graul, a great German Scholar; and he was so much taken with <br />it that he learned the Tamil language in order to enjoy Kural in the <br />original and then preceded to translate it into German in 1854 and <br />into Latin in 1856. <br /><br />After translating a good portion of the Thirukkural, Dr. Graul <br />declared, "No translation can convey any idea of its charming <br />effect. It is truly an apple of gold in a network of silver". <br /><br />Scholars who have studied it in western translations (of which <br />several exist) have been impressed by its universal appeal. Albert <br />Schweitzer who read it in German translation says in his book Indian <br />Thought and Development (1951) " there hardly exists in the <br />literature of the world a book of lofty maxims". <br /><br />M. Ariel, a great French Savant, translated in 1848 some fragments of <br />the Kural into French and he referred to an earlier French <br />translation of the Kural made by some unknown author in 1730 AD and <br />kept in the Bibliotheque Nationale of France.<br /><br />It may perhaps be relevant to recapture the assessment of M. Ariel, <br />who says: "that which above all is wonderful in the Kural is the <br />fact that its author addresses himself without regard to castes, <br />peoples, or beliefs, to the whole community of mankind, that he <br />formulates sovereign morality and absolute reason; that he proclaims <br />In their eternal abstractness, virtue and truth; that it presents, as <br />it were, in one group, the highest laws of domestic and social life; <br />that he is equally perfect in thought, in language and in poetry, in <br />the austere metaphysical contemplation of the great mysteries of the <br />Divine nature as in the easy and graceful analysis of the tenderest <br />emotions of the heart". <br /><br />The following observations of Rev. Dr. G. U. Pope, who translated the <br />Kural into English in 1886, deserve mention: " It is certainly not an <br />anthology but the perfect and most elaborate work of one master".  <br />There was a notion among the European Christian Missionaries that <br />humility, charity, and forgiveness of injuries are virtues, which <br />have not been preached by non-Christian nations. He exploded this <br />prejudice and observed, "Grant says that humility, charity and <br />forgiveness of injuries are not described by Aristotle. Now these <br />three are everywhere forcibly inculcated by this Tamil moralist <br />(Thiruvalluvar).<br /><br />Rev. Dr. J. Lazarus, a missionary himself, proclaimed, "The Kural <br />cannot be improved nor its plan made more perfect. It is a perfect <br />mosaic in itself. A slight change in the size, shape or color of a <br />single stone would mar the beauty of the whole. It is refreshing to <br />think that a Nation, which has produced so great a man and so unique <br />a work, cannot be a hopeless despicable race. The morality he <br />preached could not have grown except out of an essentially moral <br />soil". <br /><br />Rev. Percival, a perceptive English critic, proclaimed; "nothing <br />certainly in the whole compass of human language can equal the force <br />and terseness of the sententious distiches in which the author <br />conveys the lessons of wisdom he utters".<br /><br />It is, therefore, no surprise that Thirukural is the most translated <br />of the Tamil works. It has been translated into Latin, German, <br />French, Dutch, Finish, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Fiji, Malay, and <br />Burmese and into such Indian languages as Sanskrit, Urdu, Marathi, <br />Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, and Malayalam. There are in fact as many as <br />eighty-two translations of the Thirukkural in foreign languages. <br /><br />Umaruppulavar wrote the history of Nabigal Nayagam in epic form in <br />the name "Seerappuranam". In Tamil not only literary works but also <br />classics in the fields of Astrology, Medicine etc, were made in verse <br />forms. Even dictionaries were written in verse. They were called <br />the `Nigandus' (Thesauruses). <br /><br />In 1862, Dr. M. Winslow, a Christian missionary in Tamil Nadu, <br />compiled a comprehensive dictionary called the "Winslow's Tamil and <br />English Dictionary", which has English meanings for 67,000. Tamil <br />words embracing both the common and poetic dialects including <br />principal astronomical, astrological, mythological, botanical, <br />scientific and official terms as well as the names of many authors, <br />poets, heroes and gods. <br /><br />Another famous poet in Tamil is Kambar (twelfth century A.D). His <br />epic Ramayanam consists of more than ten thousand verses. The story <br />is planned as the story of growing universal brotherhood and of a <br />federation of kingdoms of love and justice ruled by ideal brothers <br />without any distinction, caste etc. <br /><br />Both as a geographically widespread Indian language, and as the <br />language of groups of ethnic and sociological interest, Tamil came to <br />be studied in the USA and Tamil language found a place in the <br />teaching programs especially of the Universities of Pennsylvania, <br />Chicago, Wisconsin, California, and Kansas state, and in the rotating <br />summer school. <br /><br />The development of the South Asian Programmes in Universities <br />assumed new proportions and coordinated the research of several <br />scholars in different branches of Tamilology by the incorporation of <br />the American Institute of Indian studies. <br /><br />This Institute has supported financially a number of scholars <br />including R.E. Frykenberg, Burton Stein and Eugene F. Irschick to <br />work on various aspects of Tamilology. <br /><br />In addition to Oxford, Cambridge, Leyden, and Uppsala, the Sudasien <br />Institute in Heidelberg has a multidisciplinary programme, which <br />includes various aspects of Tamil Studies and the teaching of Tamil <br />at different levels.  <br /><br />The University of Bonn, and the University of Stockholm also <br />introduced Tamil. The works of the Leningrad and Moscow scholars, <br />together with the pupils of Dr. Arno Lehman make the Eastern Europe <br />conspicuous among schools, which contribute, to Tamil Studies.  <br /><br />Other countries like Australia, Canada, South America, Israel, Italy, <br />Japan, and Philippines also developed active interest in Tamilology.  <br />The creation of the Department of Indian Studies in the University of <br />Malaya with its South East Asian orientation, its emphasis on Tamil <br />Studies and its schedule of publications is a turning point in the <br />history of Tamil Studies.</div>

All of these languages contain Tamil words. This<br />shows the antiquity of Tamil. Further these languages are not spoken<br />today. There are a number of Tamil words found even in English, for<br />example the English words mango, cash, curry, catamaran, coir, coolie<br />to name a few, have Tamil origins. Tamil is recognized today as the<br />earliest language possessing an unbroken history of literary<br />production for the past twenty centuries.<br /><br />In the earliest times all Tamil literary works were composed in<br />poetic form. All books were written in verse.<br /><br />Tamil has its own independent script and literary history dating back<br />from the early pre Christian era. There are 247 characters in the<br />Tamil script, which may be condensed to 38-40.<br /><br />With little change over the centuries literate readers can easily<br />follow the ancient works today. Christian missionaries working in<br />South India and Sri Lanka introduced printing and simplified Tamil<br />prose writing only in the eighteenth century.<br /><br />The meaning of the word Tamil is sweet, beauty and naturalness. This<br />word occurs in the Tholkappiam, the earliest text written work in<br />Tamil. Tholkappiam is a grammatical work belonging to the third<br />century B.C. In the ancient literature the word Tamil also denotes<br />the race, country, people and army.<br /><br />Tamil is rich in vocabulary showing subtle and minute differences in<br />meaning. For example, the word vaaymai denotes truth by words. The<br />word unmai denotes truth by mind (thought) while the word meymai<br />stands for truth by body (action).<br /><br />There are seven words in Tamil to denote the various stages of<br />flower from bud to dry flower. ? wiz, arumpu, mottu, mukai, malar,<br />alar, vii, and cemmal.<br /><br />Many books become obsolete during the lifetime of the author, some<br />after a century; some others after a few centuries; but obsolete they<br />do become.<br /><br />Thirukkal as a book that deals with `the Art of Living', is gaining<br />increasing acceptance. It consists of thousand three hundred and<br />thirty couplets called Kurals each being an epigram, simple forcible<br />and at the same time captivating.<br /><br />It is said to occupy in the literature of world a place comparable<br />to the Confucian analects, Plato's dialogues, Aristotle's ethics and<br />Seneca's writings.<br /><br />The author of this great work Thiruvalluvar lived between the third<br />and the first century B.C. During this period, Tamil Nadu had wide<br />international contacts with countries ranging from Egypt, Greece, and<br />Rome in the west, Burma, Malaysia, and China in the east. A<br />representative of the Pandya King attended the coronation of Emperor<br />Augustus in Rome, as mentioned by Strabo, A Greek who wrote his<br />Geography in the first century AD.<br /><br />An arrestingly astute couplet of the poet was explained in English<br />to Dr. Graul, a great German Scholar; and he was so much taken with<br />it that he learned the Tamil language in order to enjoy Kural in the<br />original and then preceded to translate it into German in 1854 and<br />into Latin in 1856.<br /><br />After translating a good portion of the Thirukkural, Dr. Graul<br />declared, "No translation can convey any idea of its charming<br />effect. It is truly an apple of gold in a network of silver".<br /><br />Scholars who have studied it in western translations (of which<br />several exist) have been impressed by its universal appeal. Albert<br />Schweitzer who read it in German translation says in his book Indian<br />Thought and Development (1951) " there hardly exists in the<br />literature of the world a book of lofty maxims".<br /><br />M. Ariel, a great French Savant, translated in 1848 some fragments of<br />the Kural into French and he referred to an earlier French<br />translation of the Kural made by some unknown author in 1730 AD and<br />kept in the Bibliotheque Nationale of France.<br /><br />It may perhaps be relevant to recapture the assessment of M. Ariel,<br />who says: "that which above all is wonderful in the Kural is the<br />fact that its author addresses himself without regard to castes,<br />peoples, or beliefs, to the whole community of mankind, that he<br />formulates sovereign morality and absolute reason; that he proclaims<br />In their eternal abstractness, virtue and truth; that it presents, as<br />it were, in one group, the highest laws of domestic and social life;<br />that he is equally perfect in thought, in language and in poetry, in<br />the austere metaphysical contemplation of the great mysteries of the<br />Divine nature as in the easy and graceful analysis of the tenderest<br />emotions of the heart".<br /><br />The following observations of Rev. Dr. G. U. Pope, who translated the<br />Kural into English in 1886, deserve mention: " It is certainly not an<br />anthology but the perfect and most elaborate work of one master".<br />There was a notion among the European Christian Missionaries that<br />humility, charity, and forgiveness of injuries are virtues, which<br />have not been preached by non-Christian nations. He exploded this<br />prejudice and observed, "Grant says that humility, charity and<br />forgiveness of injuries are not described by Aristotle. Now these<br />three are everywhere forcibly inculcated by this Tamil moralist<br />(Thiruvalluvar).<br /><br />Rev. Dr. J. Lazarus, a missionary himself, proclaimed, "The Kural<br />cannot be improved nor its plan made more perfect. It is a perfect<br />mosaic in itself. A slight change in the size, shape or color of a<br />single stone would mar the beauty of the whole. It is refreshing to<br />think that a Nation, which has produced so great a man and so unique<br />a work, cannot be a hopeless despicable race. The morality he<br />preached could not have grown except out of an essentially moral<br />soil".<br /><br />Rev. Percival, a perceptive English critic, proclaimed; "nothing<br />certainly in the whole compass of human language can equal the force<br />and terseness of the sententious distiches in which the author<br />conveys the lessons of wisdom he utters".<br /><br />It is, therefore, no surprise that Thirukural is the most translated<br />of the Tamil works. It has been translated into Latin, German,<br />French, Dutch, Finish, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Fiji, Malay, and<br />Burmese and into such Indian languages as Sanskrit, Urdu, Marathi,<br />Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, and Malayalam. There are in fact as many as<br />eighty-two translations of the Thirukkural in foreign languages.<br /><br />Umaruppulavar wrote the history of Nabigal Nayagam in epic form in<br />the name "Seerappuranam". In Tamil not only literary works but also<br />classics in the fields of Astrology, Medicine etc, were made in verse<br />forms. Even dictionaries were written in verse. They were called<br />the `Nigandus' (Thesauruses).<br /><br />In 1862, Dr. M. Winslow, a Christian missionary in Tamil Nadu,<br />compiled a comprehensive dictionary called the "Winslow's Tamil and<br />English Dictionary", which has English meanings for 67,000. Tamil<br />words embracing both the common and poetic dialects including<br />principal astronomical, astrological, mythological, botanical,<br />scientific and official terms as well as the names of many authors,<br />poets, heroes and gods.<br /><br />Another famous poet in Tamil is Kambar (twelfth century A.D). His<br />epic Ramayanam consists of more than ten thousand verses. The story<br />is planned as the story of growing universal brotherhood and of a<br />federation of kingdoms of love and justice ruled by ideal brothers<br />without any distinction, caste etc.<br /><br />Both as a geographically widespread Indian language, and as the<br />language of groups of ethnic and sociological interest, Tamil came to<br />be studied in the USA and Tamil language found a place in the<br />teaching programs especially of the Universities of Pennsylvania,<br />Chicago, Wisconsin, California, and Kansas state, and in the rotating<br />summer school.<br /><br />The development of the South Asian Programmes in Universities<br />assumed new proportions and coordinated the research of several<br />scholars in different branches of Tamilology by the incorporation of<br />the American Institute of Indian studies.<br /><br />This Institute has supported financially a number of scholars<br />including R.E. Frykenberg, Burton Stein and Eugene F. Irschick to<br />work on various aspects of Tamilology.<br /><br />In addition to Oxford, Cambridge, Leyden, and Uppsala, the Sudasien<br />Institute in Heidelberg has a multidisciplinary programme, which<br />includes various aspects of Tamil Studies and the teaching of Tamil<br />at different levels.<br /><br />The University of Bonn, and the University of Stockholm also<br />introduced Tamil. The works of the Leningrad and Moscow scholars,<br />together with the pupils of Dr. Arno Lehman make the Eastern Europe<br />conspicuous among schools, which contribute, to Tamil Studies.<br /><br />Other countries like Australia, Canada, South America, Israel, Italy,<br />Japan, and Philippines also developed active interest in Tamilology.<br />The creation of the Department of Indian Studies in the University of<br />Malaya with its South East Asian orientation, its emphasis on Tamil<br />Studies and its schedule of publications is a turning point in the<br />history of Tamil Studies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />All new Yahoo!

R. Vadivale &#40;CIBC Mellon - Toronto&#41; <br />  <br />  In about 1730 AD, the Tamil Thirukkural was translated into Latin <br />by <br />  Fr. Beschi, one of the greatest European Tamil scholars. Rev. <br />Beschi <br />  an Italian Christian missionary who came to India learnt Tamil <br />  grammars and literature to carry on his missionary work. He wore <br />  saffron dress like sadhus and assumed the Tamil name <br />Veeramamunivar. <br />  He composed the story of Jesus Christ in the form of an epic poem <br />in <br />  the name Thembavani. He also wrote a prabandham called "Kavalur <br />  Kalambagam" and a grammatical treatise "Thonnool". He also <br />  wrote "Vedhiyar Ozukkam" and "Paramarthaguru".<br />  <br />  Tamil is the most ancient of the languages now spoken in India and <br />  belongs to the Dravidian family comprised of 23 languages. These <br />  languages are spoken mainly in the southern part of India as well <br />as <br />  in a few regions of central and northern parts of India. The <br />Bruhui <br />  language of the Dravidian group is spoken at present in the <br />  Baluchistan region of Pakistan near the river Sindhu. Excavations <br />at <br />  Harapa and Monhanjadaro in this region evidence the ancientness of <br />  the Dravidian languages to 5000 B.C.
