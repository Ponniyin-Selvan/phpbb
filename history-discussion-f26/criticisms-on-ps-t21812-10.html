And<br />    talking of Moha Mull, I have tried to read it any no<br />    of times but was unable to go beyond page two. What<br />    do you have to say about this.

This book takes some fine stories from<br />    the first 10 years of Kanaiyazhi &#40;1964-74&#41; and the<br />    selection is by Asokamitran. There is a very funny,<br />    satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan&#39;s style of<br />    writing called &#39;Mazha naatu magudam&#39; by Nagupoleon.<br />    Apparently this is his only story. The story is two<br />    episodes &#40;Episode 300 and 301&#41; of a long running<br />    historical ovel in a weekly and a piece of the<br />    writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of<br />    the episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into<br />    thinking about the literary criticisms levelled at<br />    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was<br />    enamoured by the romanticness of it, I actually<br />    moved away from it during my college days&#40;I studied<br />    in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;. For what reasons? because it<br />    is a romantic novel and reading it doesnt alter one<br />    thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are those of us<br />    who got interested in their history but I think the<br />    percentage is much lower . But being a romantic<br />    novel, there is no point in looking for things to<br />    improve upon the soul also. I dont read, say, &#39;Three<br />    musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to do that<br />    I will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you<br />    read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for the sheer joy or it and if I want to<br />    read to improve upon the soul, I will be reading a<br />    &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;. One book I read<br />    page by page for about a month with lots of thinking<br />    is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the mocking<br />    words by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of<br />    the novel &#39;Sivagami ammal than sabathathai<br />    niraivetri vittala?&#39; This scathing remark criticizes<br />    romanicism at its extreme and questioning the<br />    escapism in life.The point here is not to throw mud<br />    on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply call this between any romantic<br />    novel vs a much realistic one. I chose to call it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />    because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group. My question is thisWhat, if<br />    any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?Muthu Prakash R<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />  __________________________________________________________<br />    Check out some new online services at Windows Live<br />    Ideasâ€”so new they haven&#39;t even been officially<br />    released yet.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.msnspecials.in/windowslive/">http://www.msnspecials.in/windowslive/</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  __________________________________________________________<br />  Sick sense of humor?

			<div class="content">The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />There are those who think literature should serve to lift your soul <br />and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps to <br />refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance to <br />the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has proved <br />it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect directly <br />with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner workings <br />of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> inside <br />having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable, <br />there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short story. <br />Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the <br />workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine (who <br />swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a saivite/vaishnavite) <br />and some inscription as base.

The story is two episodes &#40;Episode <br />300 <br />    and<br />        301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />piece <br />  of<br />        the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />        episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />  about <br />    the<br />        literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />        Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />by <br />  the<br />        romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />    college<br />        days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />        For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading <br />it<br />        doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />those <br />    of us<br />        who got interested in their history but I think the <br />percentage <br />  is<br />        much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in<br />        looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />read,<br />        say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to do <br />  that <br />    I<br />        will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for <br />  the<br />        sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />  soul, I<br />        will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />        One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />        thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the <br />mocking <br />    words<br />        by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />  novel &#39;Sivagami<br />        ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This scathing <br />  remark<br />        criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />    escapism in<br />        life.<br />       <br />        The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply <br />call <br />    this<br />        between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose <br />to <br />    call<br />        it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group.

But what is being served is escapist fare which helps<br />to<br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance<br />to<br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from<br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of<br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and<br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer.

			<div class="content">Hi<br />literature like costume and cuisine will not have the same effect on <br />different people.<br /><br />when we encounter literature not to our taste some choose to ignore <br />it and some calling it decandent literature take the law into their <br />hands along with a flaming torch.<br /><br /><br />the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the Burning of books <br />and burying of scholars under China's Qin Dynasty, the destruction of <br />Mayan codices by Spanish invaders, and in more recent times the book <br />burnings by the Nazis.<br /><br />The Ray Bradbury novel Fahrenheit 451 is about a fictional future <br />society that has institutionalized book burning. In Orwell's Nineteen <br />Eighty-Four, the euphemistically-called "memory hole" is used to burn <br />any book or written text which is inconvenient to the regime, and <br />there is mention of "the total destruction of all books published <br />before 1960".<br /><br /><br />venketesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash <br />R"  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine <br />&#40;who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a saivite/vaishnavite&#41; <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called. <br />  The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider &#39;Thyaga <br />  boomi&#39; and &#39;Alai Osai&#39; on a higher plane than <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly the <br />  same reason.<br />  <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    hi sirs,<br />    <br />    to anyone who has read kalki&#39;s works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> still <br />  hold <br />    their own.<br />    <br />    the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />    background research that has gone into the historic fiction &#40; i <br />  dont <br />    think you can straight away classify <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as a romance ...ss to <br />some <br />    extent&#41; - to think of a novel written from the remanents of three <br />    culverts - and to spin a web that had &#40; and is still is&#41; <br />capturing <br />    the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />    works.<br />    <br />    lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />    characters or the fictional ones - Kalki&#39;s portrayal of each and <br />    every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />  the <br />    crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />    glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />    blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />  be <br />    calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />    <br />    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.<br />    <br />    rgds<br />    vj<br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />    everyone <br />      else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />  inferior <br />      feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with <br />the <br />      reading itself.<br />      <br />      "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />  clearly. <br />    He <br />      just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />      asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />    this <br />      guy is. And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good novels <br />      depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />  great <br />      novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing <br />him <br />      actually shows ignorance. <br />      <br />      Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />  you <br />      cannot read past two pages of &#39;Oru puliyamarathin Kathai&#39; <br />  or &#39;Moga <br />      mull&#39;, that is understandable but that does not anyway depletes <br />    the <br />      place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />      <br />      By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> but <br />    has <br />      read &#39;Paradise lost&#39; completely &#40;which I find it difficult to <br />  read <br />      even the title page&#41;. Thus, &#39;easier to read&#39; criteria does not <br />    make <br />      anything great or add any literary value. <br />      <br />      Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not hold <br />      good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />      assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br />      <br />      Coming back to Venkatesh&#39;s point that we need to define what <br />      literature is, I would think any good literature to record life <br />  as <br />      it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />  Ofcourse, <br />      this is one person&#39;s view. What say you?<br />      <br />      The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value <br />of <br />      <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />      <br />      Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />    Asokamithran, <br />      Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br />      <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  wrote:<br />       <br />        I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai. <br />I <br />      have heard<br />        thats the best book ever written.

			<div class="content">to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the greatest king in india was Asoka, the <br />greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his greatest <br />contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism was from <br />distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks wearning face <br />masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of sravanabelagola, <br />srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten years ago i would <br />look forward to the lux soaps n body spray bought by visitors from <br />there)<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> opened my eyes to the greatness that has been forgotten ( or <br />bulldozed) by north indian versions of indian history compulsorily <br />infused into our school history..to dwell deeper and realise the <br />real greatness - lets call it true fame..meikirti. before that south <br />indian kings were shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose <br />costumes, buxom queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the <br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in <br />one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja thi <br />raja, raja marthanda...<br /><br />to look at tanjore big temple, mahabalipuram in new light - not just <br />taking an occasional visitor on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all <br />the white skins there ` appreciating the stone work"...now a days <br />its more a spiritual feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue. <br />each one has a story to tell.<br /><br />when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 years ago and <br />finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able to <br />administer their vast country, to be just, to be loved by their <br />subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the seas...i <br />can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam and <br />payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distant lanka, <br />malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world the <br />greatness of the tamilnadu.<br /><br />i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be <br />more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational <br />material than just a passing mention. i would love my son ( he is <br />just learning to read and write) to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and understand the <br />greatness of the land he hails from.<br /><br /> <br />vj<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps <br />to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has <br />proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> <br />inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine <br />&#40;who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a <br />saivite/vaishnavite&#41; <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called. <br />  The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider &#39;Thyaga <br />  boomi&#39; and &#39;Alai Osai&#39; on a higher plane than <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly the <br />  same reason.<br />  <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    hi sirs,<br />    <br />    to anyone who has read kalki&#39;s works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> still <br />  hold <br />    their own.<br />    <br />    the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />    background research that has gone into the historic fiction &#40; i <br />  dont <br />    think you can straight away classify <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as a romance ...ss to <br />some <br />    extent&#41; - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />three <br />    culverts - and to spin a web that had &#40; and is still is&#41; <br />capturing <br />    the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />    works.<br />    <br />    lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />    characters or the fictional ones - Kalki&#39;s portrayal of each and <br />    every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />  the <br />    crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />    glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />    blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />  be <br />    calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />    <br />    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> <br />and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.<br />    <br />    rgds<br />    vj<br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />    everyone <br />      else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />  inferior <br />      feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with <br />the <br />      reading itself.<br />      <br />      "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />  clearly. <br />    He <br />      just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />      asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />    this <br />      guy is. And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />novels <br />      depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />  great <br />      novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing <br />him <br />      actually shows ignorance. <br />      <br />      Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />  you <br />      cannot read past two pages of &#39;Oru puliyamarathin Kathai&#39; <br />  or &#39;Moga <br />      mull&#39;, that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />depletes <br />    the <br />      place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />      <br />      By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />but <br />    has <br />      read &#39;Paradise lost&#39; completely &#40;which I find it difficult to <br />  read <br />      even the title page&#41;. Thus, &#39;easier to read&#39; criteria does not <br />    make <br />      anything great or add any literary value. <br />      <br />      Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />hold <br />      good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />      assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br />      <br />      Coming back to Venkatesh&#39;s point that we need to define what <br />      literature is, I would think any good literature to record <br />life <br />  as <br />      it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />  Ofcourse, <br />      this is one person&#39;s view. What say you?<br />      <br />      The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value <br />of <br />      <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />      <br />      Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />    Asokamithran, <br />      Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br />      <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  wrote:<br />       <br />        I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai. <br />I <br />      have heard<br />        thats the best book ever written.

The story is two episodes &#40;Episode <br />  300 <br />      and<br />          301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />  piece <br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />    about <br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />          Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />  by <br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during <br />my <br />      college<br />          days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />reading <br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />  those <br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the <br />  percentage <br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point <br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />  read,<br />          say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to <br />do <br />    that <br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />for <br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the <br />  mocking <br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />    novel &#39;Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This scathing <br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />      escapism in<br />          life.<br />         <br />          The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply <br />  call <br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one.

I am not saying this is bad. This is true<br />from<br />    the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of<br />    today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical<br />and<br />    but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />    The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has<br />  proved<br />    it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known.<br />    When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect<br />directly<br />    with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as<br />it<br />    will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner<br />  workings<br />    of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym><br />  inside<br />    having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not<br />questionable,<br />    there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.<br />    This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The<br />    entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short<br />  story.<br />    Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha<br />    wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on<br />the<br />    workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />    climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine<br />  &#40;who<br />    swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the<br />    hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a<br />  saivite/vaishnavite&#41;<br />    and some inscription as base. Mix these in different<br />proportions<br />  you<br />    get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio.<br />    The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a<br />    larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called.<br />    The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life<br />    experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran.<br />    Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu<br />    Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc.<br />  Each<br />    is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is<br />no<br />    comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary<br />worthiness<br />    of the former is much higher than the later. I consider &#39;Thyaga<br />    boomi&#39; and &#39;Alai Osai&#39; on a higher plane than <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly<br />the<br />    same reason.<br />   <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      hi sirs,<br />     <br />      to anyone who has read kalki&#39;s works - the first thing you<br />    realise,<br />      is that you are transported into the respective era. you live<br />  the<br />      novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that<br />is<br />    the<br />      foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can<br />do<br />      that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime<br />a<br />      dozen movies released everyday - the fact that <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />still<br />    hold<br />      their own.<br />     <br />      the second most important thing - is the amount of work and<br />      background research that has gone into the historic fiction &#40;<br />i<br />    dont<br />      think you can straight away classify <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as a romance ...ss to<br />  some<br />      extent&#41; - to think of a novel written from the remanents of<br />  three<br />      culverts - and to spin a web that had &#40; and is still is&#41;<br />  capturing<br />      the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in<br />these<br />      works.<br />     <br />      lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic<br />      characters or the fictional ones - Kalki&#39;s portrayal of each<br />and<br />      every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them<br />is<br />    the<br />      crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not<br />      glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life<br />and<br />      blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown<br />to<br />    be<br />      calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />     <br />      if you poll in this site - how many people picked up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />  and<br />      finished it without a break when compared to other works is<br />but<br />      enough proof.<br />     <br />      rgds<br />      vj<br />     <br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R"<br />       wrote: <br />       <br />        One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub<br />      everyone<br />        else as connoisseurs/elitist.

The story is two episodes<br />&#40;Episode<br />    300<br />        and<br />            301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and<br />a<br />    piece<br />      of<br />            the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of<br />the<br />            episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into<br />thinking<br />      about<br />        the<br />            literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />            Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was<br />enamoured<br />    by<br />      the<br />            romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it<br />during<br />  my<br />        college<br />            days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />            For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and<br />  reading<br />    it<br />            doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there<br />are<br />    those<br />        of us<br />            who got interested in their history but I think the<br />    percentage<br />      is<br />            much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no<br />point<br />  in<br />            looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I<br />dont<br />    read,<br />            say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want<br />to<br />  do<br />      that<br />        I<br />            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />  for<br />      the<br />            sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon<br />the<br />      soul, I<br />            will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />            One book I read page by page for about a month with<br />lots of<br />            thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the<br />    mocking<br />        words<br />            by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the<br />      novel &#39;Sivagami<br />            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This<br />scathing<br />      remark<br />            criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning<br />the<br />        escapism in<br />            life.<br />           <br />            The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.

			<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />Although I have been lurking here for a while, I havent participated directly in the discussions here. Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular contributions.<br /><br />First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was introduced to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my 8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be the works of Ayn Rand.<br /><br />I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> school and there would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame ourselves for it.<br /><br />Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This continues to this date so much so that a society is completely corrupted.<br /><br />Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and dignity.<br /><br />More later<br />Sandeep<br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote: to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the greatest king in india was Asoka, the<br />greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his greatest<br />contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism was from<br />distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks wearning face<br />masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of sravanabelagola,<br />srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten years ago i would<br />look forward to the lux soaps n body spray bought by visitors from<br />there)<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> opened my eyes to the greatness that has been forgotten ( or<br />bulldozed) by north indian versions of indian history compulsorily<br />infused into our school history..to dwell deeper and realise the<br />real greatness - lets call it true fame..meikirti. before that south<br />indian kings were shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose<br />costumes, buxom queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the<br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in<br />one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja thi<br />raja, raja marthanda...<br /><br />to look at tanjore big temple, mahabalipuram in new light - not just<br />taking an occasional visitor on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all<br />the white skins there ` appreciating the stone work"...now a days<br />its more a spiritual feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue.<br />each one has a story to tell.<br /><br />when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 years ago and<br />finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able to<br />administer their vast country, to be just, to be loved by their<br />subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the seas...i<br />can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam and<br />payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distant lanka,<br />malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world the<br />greatness of the tamilnadu.<br /><br />i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be<br />more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational<br />material than just a passing mention. i would love my son ( he is<br />just learning to read and write) to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and understand the<br />greatness of the land he hails from.<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The important question that is being raised again is whether<br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here.<br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your<br />soul<br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort.<br />  I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are<br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps<br />to<br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance<br />to<br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from<br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of<br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and<br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has<br />proved<br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known.<br />  When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect directly<br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it<br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner<br />workings<br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym><br />inside<br />  having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable,<br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.<br />  This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The<br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short<br />story.<br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha<br />  wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on the<br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine<br />&#40;who<br />  swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the<br />  hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a<br />saivite/vaishnavite&#41;<br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions<br />you<br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio.<br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a<br />  larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called.<br />  The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life<br />  experiences and cannot be repeated.

The story is two episodes &#40;Episode<br />  300<br />      and<br />          301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a<br />  piece<br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking<br />    about<br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />          Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured<br />  by<br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during<br />my<br />      college<br />          days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and<br />reading<br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are<br />  those<br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the<br />  percentage<br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point<br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont<br />  read,<br />          say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to<br />do<br />    that<br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />for<br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the<br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the<br />  mocking<br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the<br />    novel &#39;Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This scathing<br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the<br />      escapism in<br />          life.<br />         <br />          The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply<br />  call<br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one.

			<div class="content">I think literature should exist in all forms. It will be difficult to compare say Ayn Rand's Fountain Head or Atlas Shrugged with for instance the works of Kalki but then again I feel both present the same sense of life.<br /><br />Kalki has in very simple words created a beautiful sense of life, portrayed the period in a simple yet eloquent way and as a result has given these unique characters in our history a new life and 'due' that they truly deserve.<br /><br />I feel his work is absolutely essential for our society as it is easy and interesting for many to like, as well as, get the greater picture. I think we really need the greater picture in today's world.<br /><br />Regards<br />Sandeep<br /><br />"R.venketesh"  wrote: Hi<br />literature like costume and cuisine will not have the same effect on<br />different people.<br /><br />when we encounter literature not to our taste some choose to ignore<br />it and some calling it decandent literature take the law into their<br />hands along with a flaming torch.<br /><br />the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the Burning of books<br />and burying of scholars under China's Qin Dynasty, the destruction of<br />Mayan codices by Spanish invaders, and in more recent times the book<br />burnings by the Nazis.<br /><br />The Ray Bradbury novel Fahrenheit 451 is about a fictional future<br />society that has institutionalized book burning. In Orwell's Nineteen<br />Eighty-Four, the euphemistically-called "memory hole" is used to burn<br />any book or written text which is inconvenient to the regime, and<br />there is mention of "the total destruction of all books published<br />before 1960".<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash<br />R"  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The important question that is being raised again is whether<br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here.<br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your soul<br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort.<br />  I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are<br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps to<br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance<br />to<br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from<br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of<br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and<br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has proved<br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known.<br />  When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect directly<br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it<br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner workings<br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> inside<br />  having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not questionable,<br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.<br />  This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The<br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short story.<br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha<br />  wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on the<br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine<br />&#40;who<br />  swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the<br />  hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a saivite/vaishnavite&#41;<br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions<br />you<br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio.<br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a<br />  larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called.<br />  The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life<br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran.<br />  Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu<br />  Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc.<br />Each<br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated.

The story is two episodes &#40;Episode<br />  300<br />      and<br />          301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a<br />  piece<br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking<br />    about<br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />          Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was enamoured<br />  by<br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my<br />      college<br />          days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and<br />reading<br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are<br />  those<br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the<br />  percentage<br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point<br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont<br />  read,<br />          say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want to do<br />    that<br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />for<br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the<br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the<br />  mocking<br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the<br />    novel &#39;Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This scathing<br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the<br />      escapism in<br />          life.<br />         <br />          The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can simply<br />  call<br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose<br />  to<br />      call<br />          it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group.

The school is divided <br />here. <br />    There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />  soul <br />    and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />    I agree that Kalki&#39;s characterizations and narrative style are <br />    exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which <br />helps <br />  to <br />    refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no <br />relevance <br />  to <br />    the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true <br />from <br />    the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />    today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical <br />and <br />    but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />    The question is not about Kalki&#39;s skills as a writer. He has <br />  proved <br />    it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />    When I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39; I was able to connect <br />directly <br />    with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as <br />it <br />    will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />  workings <br />    of your heart to such an extent that you change a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> <br />  inside <br />    having read it. While the joy of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not <br />questionable, <br />    there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />    This is because <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />    entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />  story. <br />    Moreover, the writing is formulaic &#40;I believe Sujatha <br />    wrote &#39;kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai&#39; more as a satire on <br />the <br />    workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story&#41;. You have a social-<br />    climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> complicated heroine <br />  &#40;who <br />    swoons on seeing the hero&#41;, a villainess who also falls for the <br />    hero, some medieval comic element&#40;preferably a <br />  saivite/vaishnavite&#41; <br />    and some inscription as base. Mix these in different <br />proportions <br />  you <br />    get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />    The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />    larger rate than the &#39;classics&#39; as they are derisively called. <br />    The &#39;classics&#39; are difficult because they are unique life <br />    experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />    Read &#39;Pathinettavathu Atchakodu&#39;, &#39;Kanavu <br />    Thozhirchalai&#39;, &#39;Manasarovar&#39;, &#39;Agaya Thamarai&#39;, &#39;Thaneer&#39; etc. <br />  Each <br />    is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is <br />no <br />    comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />worthiness <br />    of the former is much higher than the later. I consider &#39;Thyaga <br />    boomi&#39; and &#39;Alai Osai&#39; on a higher plane than <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> for exactly <br />the <br />    same reason.<br />    <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      hi sirs,<br />      <br />      to anyone who has read kalki&#39;s works - the first thing you <br />    realise, <br />      is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />  the <br />      novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that <br />is <br />    the <br />      foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can <br />do <br />      that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime <br />a <br />      dozen movies released everyday - the fact that <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />still <br />    hold <br />      their own.<br />      <br />      the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />      background research that has gone into the historic fiction &#40; <br />i <br />    dont <br />      think you can straight away classify <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as a romance ...ss to <br />  some <br />      extent&#41; - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />  three <br />      culverts - and to spin a web that had &#40; and is still is&#41; <br />  capturing <br />      the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in <br />these <br />      works.<br />      <br />      lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />      characters or the fictional ones - Kalki&#39;s portrayal of each <br />and <br />      every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them <br />is <br />    the <br />      crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />      glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life <br />and <br />      blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown <br />to <br />    be <br />      calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />      <br />      if you poll in this site - how many people picked up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> <br />  and <br />      finished it without a break when compared to other works is <br />but <br />      enough proof.<br />      <br />      rgds<br />      vj<br />      <br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />      everyone <br />        else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />    inferior <br />        feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated <br />with <br />  the <br />        reading itself.<br />        <br />        "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />    clearly. <br />      He <br />        just chose the stories to be published. May be you should <br />be <br />        asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know <br />where <br />      this <br />        guy is. And <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />  novels <br />        depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />    great <br />        novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, <br />abusing <br />  him <br />        actually shows ignorance. <br />        <br />        Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. <br />If <br />    you <br />        cannot read past two pages of &#39;Oru puliyamarathin Kathai&#39; <br />    or &#39;Moga <br />        mull&#39;, that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />  depletes <br />      the <br />        place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />        <br />        By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />  but <br />      has <br />        read &#39;Paradise lost&#39; completely &#40;which I find it difficult <br />to <br />    read <br />        even the title page&#41;. Thus, &#39;easier to read&#39; criteria does <br />not <br />      make <br />        anything great or add any literary value. <br />        <br />        Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />  hold <br />        good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at <br />our <br />        assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br />        <br />        Coming back to Venkatesh&#39;s point that we need to define <br />what <br />        literature is, I would think any good literature to record <br />  life <br />    as <br />        it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />    Ofcourse, <br />        this is one person&#39;s view. What say you?<br />        <br />        The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary <br />value <br />  of <br />        <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />        <br />        Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />      Asokamithran, <br />        Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br />        <br />        Muthu Prakash R<br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Udanx  <br />wrote:<br />         <br />          I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn <br />Kadhai. <br />  I <br />        have heard<br />          thats the best book ever written.

Criticisms can go to <br />  hell, <br />      for <br />        all I care!<br />           <br />            Ramaswamy<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            ------------------------------<br />            To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />            From: mprakas@<br />            Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:32:03 +0000<br />            Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Criticisms on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />           <br />           <br />            All<br />           <br />            I was reading a collection of stories <br />from &#39;Kanaiyazhi&#39;. <br />    This <br />        book<br />            takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />    Kanaiyazhi <br />        &#40;1964-<br />            74&#41; and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />            There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, <br />  Sandilyan&#39;s <br />      style<br />            of writing called &#39;Mazha naatu magudam&#39; by Nagupoleon. <br />      Apparently<br />            this is his only story. The story is two episodes <br />&#40;Episode <br />    300 <br />        and<br />            301&#41; of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and <br />a <br />    piece <br />      of<br />            the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of <br />the<br />            episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into <br />thinking <br />      about <br />        the<br />            literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.<br />            Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> in eighth standard I was <br />enamoured <br />    by <br />      the<br />            romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it <br />during <br />  my <br />        college<br />            days&#40;I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely&#41;.<br />            For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />  reading <br />    it<br />            doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there <br />are <br />    those <br />        of us<br />            who got interested in their history but I think the <br />    percentage <br />      is<br />            much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no <br />point <br />  in<br />            looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I <br />dont <br />    read,<br />            say, &#39;Three musketeers&#39; to get any insight. If I want <br />to <br />  do <br />      that <br />        I<br />            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />  for <br />      the<br />            sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon <br />the <br />      soul, I<br />            will be reading a &#39;Moga mull&#39; or a &#39;Nizhal mutram&#39;.<br />            One book I read page by page for about a month with <br />lots of<br />            thinking is &#39;JJ sila kurippugal&#39; I still remember the <br />    mocking <br />        words<br />            by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />      novel &#39;Sivagami<br />            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?&#39; This <br />scathing <br />      remark<br />            criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning <br />the <br />        escapism in<br />            life.<br />           <br />            The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. You can <br />simply <br />    call <br />        this<br />            between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I <br />  chose <br />    to <br />        call<br />            it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group. My question is this<br />           <br />            What, if any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>/SS?<br />           <br />            Muthu Prakash R<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            ------------------------------<br />            Check out some new online services at Windows Live <br />IdeasÂ—<br />  so <br />      new <br />        they<br />            haven&#39;t even been officially released yet.
