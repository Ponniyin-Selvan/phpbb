			<div class="content">original Tamil poem in my blog<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/akananuru59/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/akananuru59/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />In this poem, the male elephant destroying gentle shoots for his<br />female to eat is compared to "Maal who trampled (mitittu) walking upon<br />[the branches of ] the trees (i.e. Kuruntamaram, the wild lime felled<br />by Kannan) in order to dress into the cooling foliage the young<br />women(makalir) of the cowherds(antar) community,[on the banks ] of<br />broad ford with wide spread sands, of Tolunai river full of water".<br /><br />This version of legend is not known to any Sanskrit source. The<br />earliest Sanskrit source seems to be either Bhagavathapurana or the<br />Vishnupurana. Hence this Akam 59 poem by Maturai Marutanilanakan seems<br />to be the earliest in India to mention the Motif of Krishna and the<br />cowherds on the banks of the Yamuna river.<br /><br />This poem also attests Thiruparankundram as one of the earliest sacred<br />sites of Murugan. The high mountain(netuvarai) with copius sandal<br />trees is mentioned which was sung about by Anutuvan, which is called<br />'cool' Parankunram and which is the seat of "Murukan of great anger<br />with the long spear with a shining leaf like point that had cut in two<br />the body of cur(curan)" .<br /><br />Incidentaly the poet sings about two most popular gods during the<br />Sangam period. Ceyon(Murukan) and Mayon(Mal).<br /><br />Reference: <br /><br />Tamil Traditions on Subramanya Murugan, Kamil V.Zvelebil,Institute of<br />Asian Studies</div>

V. Ramakrishna Rao<br /><br /> <br /><br />The paper was presented at the 55th session of Indian History <br />Congress, held at AligarhMuslimUniversity, Aligarh from December 20 <br />to 22, 1994.<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />1.1. Introduction: Much has been written about the Religion, Gods, <br />Goddesses and rituals of the ancient Tamils, but, there are few <br />studies about different cults existed during the earliest times. It <br />may be interesting to know about the existence of the cult of the <br />Sun, Moon, Fire, Mountain, Tree, Water etc as natural elements; Sur, <br />Anangu, Pavai, Surara Magalir, Varaiyara Magalir, Vanara Magalir, <br />Oru mulai arutta Tiruma Unii, Salini, Pattini etc in anthromorphic <br />forms; Ram, cattle, Cock, wall-lizard, snake etc in theriomorphic <br />forms and so on. However, as the fire-cult is one of the earliest <br />forms of religion of any society, a study of it reveals many <br />interesting details in historical perspective. How the cult <br />originated, developed, established, associated with other cults and <br />worship, incorporated and finally converted to other forms are <br />analyzed and discussed based on the ancient Tamil literature, <br />popularly known as "Sangam literature". Only Tolkappiyam (not <br />falling under the category of Sangam literature), Pattuppattu and <br />Ettuttogai (generally accepted by all as Sangam literature) are <br />taken for study as it covers the history of Tamils up to few <br />centuries of the current era1. The anthropological evidence about <br />fire goes back to megalithic and Neolithic periods (c. 2500 BCE and <br />before). Epigraphical and Iconographic evidences belong to later <br />period after first few centuries.<br /><br /> <br /><br />1.2. Importance of fire: Fire has been an important factor, <br />occupying almost all aspects of life, perhaps, from birth to death <br />of man and even beyond. For man, fire is fear, all-pervading, <br />adorable, effulgent, purifying, affecting, curing, life-producing, <br />creator and destroyer. Man must have experienced, enjoyed, suffered <br />and understood these characters of fire, as his immediate encounter <br />has been the forms of Sun, Moon, lightning, volcano, forest fire and <br />of course, his own produced fire. All such experiences with the <br />psychological processes with fire must have led him to start <br />respecting, venerating and worshipping. The wide usage of fire for <br />domestic, technical, religious and other secular purposes shows its <br />ready availability i.e., instant production of it by any mechanical, <br />or chemical process as found in the case of fire-stick, fire-stone <br />or match-stock.<br /><br /> <br /><br />2. The expressions used for fire in the ancient Tamil literature: Ti <br />(general term), Eri (burning fire), Teral (fire, heat), Tanal (live <br />coal), Kolli (fire-brand), Kanal (live-coal, heat), Kanali (of that <br />type), Neruppu (general term), Sudar (single uniform flame), Tazhal <br />(ember), Azhal, Gneli (produced by bamboo), Gnezhili (fire-brand), <br />Imam (pyre), Vilakku (lamp), Alar (of spreading nature), Kadir <br />(rays), are the words used to indicate fire of different nature. <br />Alari, Kanthal, Vengai, Ambal, Kuvalai (all flowers), Vanni, <br />Kuvilam, Vengai (trees); Erikkodi, Valli (creepers); Gnayiru (Moon), <br />Kodi (Flaming); Ahuti (sacred fire of yagna), Sudu (heat, fire), <br />Velvi (yagna), Kalavelvi (yagna of battle-field), Vettu (perform <br />yagna) are used to denote indirectly, because of their nature, <br />property, appearance, clour, form and association with fire. Another <br />important fact is that each of the above expressions has an <br />alternative meaning denoting a red or bright star (semmeen) and the <br />Red planet (Mars-Sevvai) proving not only the origin of Solar <br />system, but also the knowledge of man relating them.<br /><br /> <br /><br />3. Fire and Domestic use: The significance of domestic application <br />of fire is noted in the different expressions used. The cooking fire <br />is characteristically mentioned by the usual words (as noted above Â– <br />Puram.20:7-9; Agam.172:13; 237:9). Vayitrutti is used to signify the <br />stomach fire; Kavalti for protection; Kamatti to denote lust and so <br />on. Fire used for lightning is known with different names. Even <br />lamps used for such purpose are known characteristically depending <br />upon the size, shape and use Â– Vilakku (lamp), Vilakkam (bigger size <br />lamp), Tipam (lamp used for other purposes), Nantha vilakku <br />(continuously burning lamp),Madattolleri (fire kept at the place of <br />chief or king), Ima vilakku (lamps or fire kept at crematory <br />grounds), Tundu (lamps requires trimming), Sudar (lamp with uniform-<br />single flame), Kadir (lam with rays), Agal (earthern lamp), Tagazhi <br />(the bowl of a lamp), Pandali (made of metal), Pavai vilakku ( metal <br />lamp in the form of woman carrying a lamp in hands). Fire is <br />produced by the fire-drill and kept blowing through a tube <br />(Perum.178-79). Fire is also kept by Parppar, Andanar and the like <br />for sacrificial purposes (Puram.2:23; Pari.5:42; Kali.69:5).<br /><br /> <br /><br />4. Fire and Technology: For the manufacture of different types of <br />ceramic ware, big kilns were arranged and fired (Puram.228:2-4); <br />Agam.308:6). Different burial and crematory urns were manufactured. <br />Kaveripumpattinam excavations prove the usage of bricks supported by <br />literary evidences. The excellent ferrous and non-ferrous implements <br />found at different sites prove the knowledge of material science and <br />processes like smelting, casting, wire-drawing and treat treatment <br />(Puram.21:7-8). Other metal work and jewelry manufacture also <br />support the fact. The occurrence of quartz, glass and other beads <br />with fine holes and colours prove the usage of temperature of the <br />order of 1350-15000C. The ferrous and non-ferrous technology also <br />requires the same range of temperature. All these literary and <br />archaeological evidences prove the metallurgical skill of the <br />ancient Tamils with the appropriate usage of fire in the applied <br />technology.<br /><br /> <br /><br />5. Fire and Fire-god: Tolkappiyam gives direct reference to fire-<br />worship. The specific expressions used are Kodinilai, Kandazhi and <br />Valli (Porul.Purattitai.88) to denote the existence of worship in <br />three forms Â– the Sun in the sky, Fire on the earth and the Moon in <br />the waters. This resembles Rigvedic description about the presence <br />of fire in three forms : terreststial Â– agni; celestial Â– Indira and <br />Solar Â– Sun, Mutti Â– three fires.Panchagniis also implied in <br />Paditruppattu (14:1-4). After mentioning the four natural elements <br />earethm water, ether and air, five types of fire are mentioned as : <br />star, lightning, moon, Sun and fire. There is a possibility that the <br />word "Deivam" directly denotes Fire-god as both roots Tevu and Te <br />connote destruction and fire as explained: <br /><br /> <br /><br />1. tevu + am = destroy + nature of = destroyer.<br /><br />2. ta + i + am = Fire + God + of nature = Fire-god.<br /><br /> <br /><br />This is also supported by the following references, in which the <br />nature of Fire-god is succinctly brought out: <br /><br /> <br /><br />Teral arum kadavul (Agam.396:7-8) = Fiery unique God.<br /><br />Arum teral marabir kadvul (Agam.372:1) = unique-fiery-traditional <br />God.<br /><br />Teral aru marabin kadavyl (Agam.13:3) = Fiewry-unique-traditional <br />God.<br /><br />Teral arum kadavul (Natri.189:3) = Fiery-unique God.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In all these references, the God is worshipped, prayed and invoked; <br />vow / oath taken before him (as a witness).<br /><br /> <br /><br />6. Taking Oath before fire by a lover: It is described as to how the <br />raising fire invites pouring ghee in it, so the lover is eager to <br />accept the lady-love for marriage. Thus, he informs the messenger <br />implying that he is prepared to marry her with sacraments before the <br />kindled fire raised by ghee (Kurun.106:5-6). The lover takes vow <br />before "Teral arum kadavul (Agam.396:7-8) = Fiery-unique God" and <br />promises holding her hand that he would not forsake / desert her. <br />Some commentators suggest that the God mentioned here is Shiva, but <br />there was no practice of taking oath / vow before Shiva, in fact, <br />the name "Shiva" is not at all found in the ancient Tamil <br />literature2. There is also a reference about going around the fire, <br />just like swans going round a pond (Kali.69:5).<br /><br /> <br /><br />7. Fire and Marriage: The above mentioned reference of going round <br />fire by couple definitely denotes the marriage ceremony. Another <br />ancient practice is the scred marriage of the fire-god with a virgin <br />symbolically. It is indirectly referred to in the commentary of <br />Naccinarkkiniyar (8th cent.CE) to Tolkappiyam. After marriage, the <br />groom is advised not to have union for three days, as they are meant <br />for the gods of Moon, Kandharvar (Sun?) and Angi (Agni). In <br />mythology, the custom of leading a bride round the fire, marrying <br />symbolically to fire-god and her illusory union with fire-god denote <br />fertility charm, union of man and woman, the role of fire or heat <br />energy placed in conception and the chastity status of woman. Fire <br />stands as a witness along with the other four elements in all such <br />union. The "Agni satchi" (fire as witness) ritual has been so <br />intimate with the Tamil culture and tradition.<br /><br /> <br /><br />8. Fire and Pregnancy: Mention has already been made about the <br />symbolic marriage and union with fire by woman. The pregnant ladies <br />worship God (Madurai.610). Natrinai explains about the smoke <br />deposited on the body of a woman, who has delivered a child <br />(Nat.380:1-5). Iyavai pugai i.e, the smoke produced by a special <br />mixture of white mustard, ghee etc., is applied to pregnant woman <br />and as well as newly born baby to drive away evil spirits and clean <br />the house / place (agam.98:15). There is also a practice that the <br />vessels of Murugan temple should not be touched by virgins and <br />pregnant women (Puram.279:6-7), as the God might affect them. In <br />fact, Velan (the priest) of Veriyadal always declares that the lady-<br />love / virgin has been affected by Murugu / Murugan. In the <br />evolution of Karttikeya / Muruga myth Sanskritic references also <br />mention that the pregnant ladies would be affected by him. The <br />goddesses Jara, Jataharini, Hariti and Ayohi associated with <br />Muruga / Karttikeya-Skanda affect pregnant ladies by destroying <br />fetus from the embryos. Here, the fiery goddesses Anangu and Sur <br />affect them. All these details are discussed below.<br /><br /> <br /><br />9. Fire and Death: the dead are cremated in accordance with the <br />principle of consigning body created by the fire i.e, by thr union <br />of man and woman. Definitely, the cremation must have been the most <br />popular cusom of the followers of fire-cult and influenced others <br />also. Thus, we find post-crematory burials in urns (Puram.256:5). <br />There has been one category of urn known as "Imattazhi" i.e, urn <br />used for burial after cremation. Such Sacophaguses (literally <br />meaning "flesh eaters") are in the form of Ram and elephant, the <br />vahanas of Fire-god and Muruga (Seyon).<br /><br /> <br /><br />10. The Principle of Fice Elements (Panchabhuta tatva): the five <br />elements earth, water, air, ether and fire have been mentioned at <br />different places (Padit.14:1-4; 24:15; Puram.2:1-6; Madu.453-54). <br />The relation between them is also explained: Earth is conglomeration <br />of soil; sky is connected with earth; wind is produced in the sky; <br />fire is from wind and water from fire (Puram.2:1-6). The relation <br />between body, life and growth with earth, water and food is also <br />explained: As the human body depends on water, giving food amounts <br />to giving life, because body is primarily based on food. Food is <br />nothing but water in association with land (earth). One who combines <br />water and land into one is God and the combination is "Unavin <br />pindam" i.e, the body is considered as food, as it grows with the <br />intake of food (Puram.18:19-23, 186:1-4). Of course, without fire, <br />the food cannot be digested, hence it is mentioned as "Vayitrutti" <br />(stomach fire) [Agam.74:5; Padit.20:26]. Without air, life cannot <br />last. This is the Panchbhuta tatva, connecting the five natural <br />elements with the creation of five senses of human body and hence <br />man himself. Therefore, if a man dies, it is quite natural to think <br />that his body should go back to the five natural elements quickly. <br />For that, fire helps in cremation. In temple worship also, it has <br />been faithfully incorporated.<br /><br /> <br /><br />11. Sati and Fire: Sati is the practice of woman entering into fire <br />along with the dead body of her husband. Many of the chaste women of <br />the ancient Tamizhagam have performed Sati. The literature <br />abundantly gives references about it3. As the marriage and union <br />take place in front of and with fire, perhaps, it was a way for them <br />to unite with their counterparts in death also through fire. In <br />fact, they have been characteristically mentioned as "Eri pugu <br />Magalir" (Ingu.Tani) i.e, ladies ready to enter fire or entering <br />fire. Perungoppendu, while performing sati says that the pond with <br />full of blossomed lotus flowers and cool waters, and the pyre with <br />flames are one and the same to her (Puram.246:11-15). Fire-walking <br />must have been a reminiscent<br /><br />practice of reduced form of sati, where fire is raised under <br />identical situation and conditions, in which women participate, even <br />today in large numbers.<br /><br /> <br /><br />12. Fire and Arunthati: The star represented by Arunthati and <br />Arunthati herself have been held in esteem by the ancient Tamils as <br />hallmark of chastity. The bright Red star "Arunthati" is seen by the <br />bride during marriage, used for counting days and exalted for her <br />nature of chastity (Padit.89:18-20). The chastity of her is <br />incomparable (Padit.65:9). Here, she is mentioned as "Kamara <br />kadavul" i.e, the Goddess who makes "Kamam" (lust) or Manmadan <br />(equivalent to "Cupid") fear. In fact, the virtue chastity is like <br />fire. That is why virgin and married women pray God with fire i.e, <br />lightning lamps as a form of `vestal fire'. Of the seven divine <br />women of the sky, the Reddish star (represented by Arunthati) is <br />considered the most chaste lady (Padit.31:26-28), because when the <br />wife of Agni, Swaha tried to assume the forms of the wives of <br />Saptarishis (the Seven Sages), she could not succeed in the case of <br />Salini i.e, Arunthati (Pari.5:44). She, with her chastity occupying <br />the highest position in the divine world, appears bright in the dark <br />(Ingu.442:3-4). Here, the name Arunthati is specifically mentioned, <br />in other places, `Semmeen' (Red star) and `Vadameen' (Northern star) <br />are used to denote her fiery chaste character and the northern <br />direction4.<br /><br /> <br /><br />13. Fire and Women: Fire, chastity and divinity are closely related, <br />connected and unfied to different goddesses-worship, Motyher goddess-<br />worship and Pattini-worship. Chastity is the prime virtue of a <br />woman, that protects not only her, but also her husband for a woman, <br />iot is like a fire, and compared with divinity (Agam.16:18, 184:1, <br />314:15; Ingu.76:4; Padit.5:4, 65:9). Women, married and unmarried <br />women light, keep and trim plamps always (Mullai.47-50; Kurinchi.224-<br />25; Pattina.246-48). "Pavai vilakku" is a lamp in the form of woman <br />holding a lamp in her hands (Mullai.85; Nedunal.101-104). In the <br />episode of Perungoppendu, all factors are brought: she declares that <br />she is not afraid of the fire (pyre), as for her the pond with <br />b;lossomed lotus flowers and cool waters, and the pyre with flames <br />are one and the same. As a chaste lady, she does not want to live <br />after the death of her husband following `Kaimmai'; Elephants bring <br />dry fire-wood; `Kanavar' (forest-dwellers) produce fire with fire-<br />drill; the pyre is made in front of a remple of goddess (Anangu); <br />she looks towards the crematory grounds, where her husband was <br />cremated and walks to the pyre. Thus, satisfying all the required <br />conditions, she is elevated to the position of Goddess.<br /><br /> <br /><br />14. Fire and Ram: Interestingly, the relation between Fire and Ram <br />is brought out in the ancient Tamil literature. The Ram with its <br />habitual shaking head protects the kindled fire in the cavity of the <br />wood produced with a drill, later it is raised with dry wood <br />(Agam.274:4-5). The fire-drill is kept inside a leather bag <br />carefully (Natri.142:3). The protection of fire by Ram or goat's <br />leather is very significant. Perhaps, the nature of Ram's leather <br />used for keeping fire-drill safely, during rainy seasons and ram's <br />fur protecting it, must have been faithfully observed and recorded. <br />Later, when fire was personified and deified, ram made the vehicle <br />(Vahana) of him. There is one poem in Purananuru, which succinctly <br />explains the relation astronomically between the fiery star Krittika <br />(Pleiades) and Mesha (Aries). In fact, the Solar year begins with <br />the Sun's entry into Aries (Mesha-Ram) [Puram.229:1-2]5.<br /><br /> <br /><br />15. Fire produced by Fire-drill: There are many references about the <br />fire produced by fire-drill. At one place, it is mentioned that fire <br />is produced by an illiterate cowherd (Puram.331:4-5). As this <br />description pertains to rural life, there must have been the <br />prevalent of other fire-producing methods other than fire-drill. The <br />spark produced by the friction of drill is used to produce fire <br />striking it on the dry leaves (Agam.39:6-7). The fire produced by <br />the fire-drill is kept growing by blowing through a pipe (Perum.178-<br />79). There are people known as Erivalarppor, Mutti marabinar etc., <br />who keep perpetual fires (Puam.2:23, 122:3, 397:20-21; Pari.5:42). <br />The muttee (three fires) are Agavaniyam, Garukapatyam and <br />Dashinagniyam represented by square, semi-circle and triangle. <br />Surprisingly, in the veri / veriyadal (bacchanalian dance), on the <br />kalam (field or place) same type of geometrical figues are drawn <br />spreadinbg rice, baked rice, paddy etc known as pirappu (an <br />offering) [Agam.98:9; Murugu.234]. in India, generally, fig <br />(Asvattha) tree has been used for upper part i.e, stick and Sumi <br />wood (Prospois spicigem) for lower part i.e, block with cavity of <br />fire-drill. But, in the literature, specific reference I made about <br />bamboo fire-drill. Moreover, as other trees have also been mentioned <br />as sacred with fiery characxteristics, they might have also been <br />used for the purpose. Badaga, Kanikar, Nayadi, Paniyan, Yanadi and <br />other tribes produce fire by this method even today. Kadirs, Irula, <br />Badaga and Andamanese use the flint and steel striking methgod. <br />Paniyans use frictional or cutting method also. Adichanallur <br />findings include Fire-pistons, therefore, blowing and filling in the <br />fir-piston must have existed.<br /><br /> <br /><br />16. Fire and Mountain: The relation of fire with mountain must have <br />been due to the fact of existence of volcano in the past. D. N. <br />Wadia6 has noted that towards the close of cretaceous, a large part <br />of the IndianPeninsula was affected by stupendous outburst of <br />volcanic energy, resulting in eruption of a thick series of lava and <br />associated pyroclastic materials. The fire produced in the mountains <br />appears in the desert (Ingu.338:3). The mountain is so covered with <br />flowers of silk cotton trees (Ilavam) that it appears, as if it is <br />burning (Ibid). The reddish mountain is engulfed with the fire, as <br />if it is surrounded with fire-creepers (Ingu.353:1). The fire that <br />originated through the bamboo trees (by friction) spreads to entire <br />hillsides by the heavy winds and the lengthy-creeper like flames <br />enter the gaps of caves and stones of hills, thereby resulting in <br />the explosion due to expansion (of stones) (Ingu.395:1-2). The <br />darkness of the caves of the mountain is removed by the glowing <br />lance (Agam.272:4-6). Lamps are lit on the top of hills (Agam.265:2-<br />3). The reddish Himalayas appear as big flame (Agam.265:2-3). This <br />description is intriguing as it is not known, when Himalayas were <br />with red colour and then it was started tro be covered with snow. <br />After the period of summer with the scorching of forests, the hills <br />are without falls, as there are no rains. At that time the lights <br />are lit on the peaks of hills (during Karttigai) on the occasion of <br />the great festival (Agam.185:10-11). Lightning lamps on the top of <br />hills clearly proves the existence of fire-worship and the <br />association of fire with the hills. Thus, Kundram, Varai, Malai <br />etc., have always been associated with fire. Tiruvannamalai, <br />Sabarimalai etc., stand proof for periodical or perpetual burning of <br />fire on the mountains. As the ancient Tamils would have observed the <br />live-volcanoes erupting and experienced the wrath of them, they <br />replicate and worship such past-symbols in the present.<br /><br /> <br /><br />17. Fire and Trees: Fire and trees are closely related to each <br />other. Each Tamil king or tribe has a sacred and Royal tree. To <br />defeat one, symbolically, first the tree is brnt or cut down. <br />Interestingly, there are many treferences about the burning down of <br />trees, towns and granaries in army-action7. The practice of sowing <br />millets, after burning down trees is also mentioned8. Forest-fires <br />are also described9. During such burning process and operations, <br />some trees might have escaped fro the ravages of fire standing <br />against it. Such trees might have been considered sacred and divine, <br />as even fire could not have done anything. Then, they start <br />regarding that God / Goddess reside in the trees. Vanni (Suma tree), <br />Kadambu, Banyan and other trees are thus considered divine.<br /><br /> <br /><br />18. Fire and Flowers: There has been an intimate relation between <br />fire and lotus elaborately brought pout by the ancient Tamil <br />poets10. The Reddish colour, the petals, their arrangement, <br />resemblance with flames, origin from waters and other details are <br />compared. The Kuvalai (Oleander), Alari (Indian willow), Vengai <br />(ptercocarpus bilobus) and Kanthal (Gloriosa superba) have always <br />been compared with the characteristics of fire. Thus, flowers are <br />compared with fire, flames adding divinity to them and then, <br />attributing to a particular God / Goddess with sacredness.<br /><br /> <br /><br />19. Fire and Sur: Sur is the goddess, variously mentioned11, <br />residing on the hills, at the sides of the hills, in the forests, <br />springs, and trees. She has born of rains (Agam.303:5-6). She has <br />been terrible and fearful forms; capable of assuming any form; <br />affecting women and children; and is just like fire. There has been <br />another Sur mentioned denoting to Surapadman, killed by Murugan. <br />Though, the commentators imply killer as "Murugan", the expressions <br />used are Sey, reddish Vel, fiery Vel, one who has Vel and so on. <br />Natrinai perhaps gives a clue to differentiate between the two Surs <br />as noted above: The goodess (Anangu) who gives the water-falls <br />resides in the hills; terrifying and fearful caves are there in such <br />hills; like a lightning, the glowing lance shows the way in the <br />caves driving darkness away with its light. This shows the slowly <br />developing of Murugan myth by transferring Sey, the Red one into <br />Muruga and Sur into Surapadma. The subjugation of Sur is further <br />shown as follows: The spring with divinity falls from the hills; the <br />Sur women dance according to the tune of the natural music produced <br />by the water-falls adorning themselves with the garlands of Kuvalai <br />and Kanthal (Natri.34:1-6).<br /><br /> <br /><br />20. Fire and Anangu: There has been another goddess "Anangu" <br />mentioned repeatedly with the same characteristics as that of Sr. <br />She resembles fire more than Sur12. Besides the natural dwelling <br />places, she has temple (Puram.247:4) and idol-form (Agam.159:5-6). <br />This proves that she is attaining the status of Goddess with full-<br />fledged worship. In the case of fire-drill, the drill is considered <br />as male and the block with hole female. Similarly, in the <br />deification of fire, Anangu might have been considered as "fire-<br />goddess". In fact, she has directly been compared with fire: Just <br />like the fire produced by drilling in the wood is used to burn other <br />fire-wood, she has become "Anangu" for her own town (as it would <br />burned down by the King, whom she refused to marry (Puram.349:6-7).<br /><br /> <br /><br />21. Fire and Kollippavai: Kollippavai, literally means a goddess <br />that kills. The Kolli hills are with high peaks (Agam.33:4); with <br />manyJack fruit trees wiuth their reddish roots (Ibid.213:15); and <br />with pure water falls. The Deiva resides in the mountains creates an <br />image of pavai with all natural traits, as if it moves with life <br />(Agam.189;2-4). It is also mentioned that she has been created by <br />the union of Bhuta (Agam.192:8-9). By the sides of such hills, <br />stands the image / painting of Kollippavai with all her bewitching <br />beauty and features, that cannot be disfigured or affected by the <br />blowing, showering rains, shaking thunders, all other natural <br />adversaries and the wrath of the entire world (Natri.201:5-11). <br />Here, she equals the fire, perhaps attaining its character.<br /><br /> <br /><br />22. Fire and Se, Se Ey or Seyon: Se denotes Red colour. Sey or Se Ey <br />connotes the Red one, juvenility, son, child, Mars and bamboo. <br />Accordingly, Seyon means one with reddish colour with youth or with <br />bull, thus implying Muruga or Shiva, however, booth names are not <br />found as such. Taking clue from Tolkappiyam, some commentators while <br />interpreting Mayon, the Black One as Tirumal (Vishnu), started <br />alluding that Seyon, the Red One as Murugan. This transition can be <br />found in Tirumurugatyruppadai itself, besides Paripadal. The former <br />starts with a specific reference to sun-worship (Murugu.1-2) goes on <br />to praise Seyon; the fiery and lengthy Vel (lance) that killed Sur <br />(46); Se Ey with reddish lance with Sevvel (61); from the first <br />face, many rays spread like flowers in the ears (206-70); he has Ram <br />and peacock as Vahana (210); brought up by six women, implying six <br />Kartgai women (255); son of God who resides under banyan tree (256); <br />Son of Goddess of mountain (257); Son of "Kotravai" (258); Child <br />of "Pazhaiyol", the ancient Goddess (259); killer of mountain <br />Kravuncha (266); the Red One Â– Se Ey (271); and killer of Sur (275). <br />In Paripadal, the references are direct: he is born of fire (5:30-<br />35); Analan (Agni) gives elephant (5:57-580, whereas, Gnaman (Yama) <br />gives Ram! (61-62) and later, other known details are given <br />faithfully. From the above, it an be noticed, in his metamorphosis <br />from fire-god to Muruga, how Seyon is made to have the characters by <br />having Reddish dress (Angi-another name for Agni), riding Ram and so <br />on. In the case of Anangu, it is directly said that "Murugan is <br />Anangu" and thus, straight away taking over Anangu by Seyon or <br />Murugan (agam.98:10-muruganangena=murugu-anangu-ena), whereas Sur <br />has been subjugated as explained above.<br /><br /> <br /><br />23. Veriyadal in Kalam: The worship of Sey, Se Ey or Seyon; murugu <br />or Neduvel is always associated and accompanied with the following: <br /><br /> <br /><br />Kalam: <br />Pandar: <br />Pirappu: <br /> <br /><br />Pillar: <br />Kodi: <br /> <br /><br />Dress: <br />Garland: <br />Music: <br />Songs: <br />Sacrifice: <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Fire: <br />Time: <br /> <br /><br />Velan: <br />Oracle: <br />Veri: <br /> <br /><br />Veriyadal: <br />the place is selected (Agam.98:14)<br /><br />a Pandal; is contructed (Agam.98:15)<br /><br />Offerings of rice, baked rice, paddy etc., arranged in geometrical <br />forms by ladies (Agam.98:9; Murugu.234).<br /><br />Kadambu pillar erected and red rope tied (Murugu.225; 230-1).<br /><br />a flag s tied in the Kadamba tree or hoisted in the pillar <br />(Agam.382:3; Murugu.237).<br /><br />two cloths are worn (Murugu.230).<br /><br />garland of buds is adorned (Agam.22 & 382).<br /><br />various musical instruments played producing din (Agam.98:14).<br /><br />sung about Neduvel.<br /><br />a goat is sacrificed and its blood is mixed with flour etc <br />(Agham.22:10); blood is sprinkled and so also turmeric mixed with <br />water (Murugu.234).<br /><br />fire is raised near the altar (Agam.138:16-18).<br /><br />the veri / veriyadal (bacchanalian dance) starts by or around <br />midnight and continues upto dawn (Ibid).<br /><br />the priest, who performs the veri / veriyadal.<br /><br />the changing of colour of the edible root (Natri.47:8).<br /><br />the disease supposedly caused by Anangu, Sur or Murugu as predicted <br />by the Velan to the mother of the affected virgin.<br /><br />thus, the dance is performed with all fun-fare<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />The first seven steps resemble that of a performance of yagna. <br />Either, yagna developed after ritualization of fire-cult must have <br />been incorporated these elements or they must have been a poor <br />imitation of yagna. As Kalavelvi is also compared with yahna, both <br />Kalavelvi and Verityadal, as for as fire-cult aspect is concerned, <br />must have been the preservation of some ancient practice and it <br />cannot be simply ignored as poetic myth, because of exaggerated <br />comparison. Unlike Kalavelvi, Veriyadal is not at all compared with <br />yagnas by the poets. However, the resemblance is significant. The <br />sacrifice and sprinkling of blood imply fertility charm. Actually, <br />the references about Veriyadal, the lady-love ridicules for the <br />performance of Veriyadal and the hypocricy of Velan, as she knows <br />her position very well. In fact, the lover is visiting her <br />stealthily as usual at the same time, when Veriyadal takes place. <br />Therefore, it is understood that the women, who are supposed to have <br />been affected or infected by Sur, Anangu, Murugu or Neduvel are <br />pregnant in most cases.<br /><br /> <br /><br />24. Kala velvi: Two types of Velvis (Yagnas) are described: One <br />performed at battle fields and another at yagnasalas. First, <br />Kalavelvi is considered: the hearth is made of human heads; Kuvilam <br />(Vilva-cratoeva religiosa) is used as fire wood; the soup is <br />prepared with intestines etc., and mixed with the ladle mae by <br />fixing skull to the stick of Vanni tree (Suma-prospis spicigera). <br />Here, the related words used Â– Adupppu (hearth), Viragu (fire-wood), <br />Vanni (Suma tree) and Vettu (Yagna) are all connected with fire. <br />Yagna performed at yagnasala are compared with the glorious acts <br />performed on the battle fields, in a similar manner (Puram.26:80=-<br />11). This may also be the poetic garb of mentioning the actual <br />yagnas performed by the kings like Rajasuyam.<br /><br /> <br /><br />25. Velvi (Yagna): There have been many references about the actual <br />yagnas performed. In fact, all the three Chera, Cola and Pandya <br />kings performed many yagnas. The names of Cholan Rajasuyam vetta <br />Perunkilli and Pandyan Palyagasalai Mudikudimi Pervazhudhiyan are <br />self0explanatory. The references about these kings are considered to <br />be very ancient of the extant Tamil literature dating back to c.300 <br />BCE and even before, Copious description about Vedas, Six Angas <br />(Vedangas), 21 types of yagnas, three fires, 14 types of cows <br />through which required ghee is obtained and duties of Andanar is <br />found (Agam.166). Yagnasalas, shape, two types of Ahuti etc., are <br />mentioned. Parppar, Andanar, Arutozhilalar, Aravor, Marayavar, <br />Muppirinulor, Irupirappalar, Vedhiyar, Munivar and other expressions <br />are used to denote persons connected with the rituals of yagnas, <br />Vedas and other fire-connected ceremonies depending upon their <br />nature of duties performed.<br /><br /> <br /><br />26. Fire Â– Creator and Destroyer: The fire that is due to burning <br />down of the cities of enemies rises to the skies like many Suns. It <br />is like Uzhitti (Mdangai-the great fire produced at the time of <br />deluge) that brings an end to this world, supposed to have hidden <br />under oceans (Vadavai Â– submarine fire: Padit.62:5-8). During <br />deluge, to reduce the burden of the world (land), water spreads <br />covering it with huge waves raising and darkness falls on it in such <br />a way that none can even know the direction. Again, there will be <br />light with the appearance of Sun and the Madangai Ti (Submarine <br />fire) boils away the deluge waters (so that the land surfaces, life <br />spring back on it) (Padit.72:10-15). This description signifies the <br />cyclic appearance and disappearance of the land mass (with <br />population) and the relation between the five natural elements. The <br />importance of fire is also brought out, as it helps the world to <br />appear again and so also life on it. Creation and destruction of <br />fire are thus explained. The conscious recording of such phenomena <br />by the ancient poets should be noted with significance.<br /><br /> <br /><br />27. Archaeological Evidences for Fire-cult13: The Neolithic culture <br />of South India used burnished ochre-coloured ware including post-<br />firing ochre painting. The pottery designs include triangles and <br />wavy lines representing fire. Other fire connected descriptions are <br />Lotus, Kanthal, Kuvalai and Vengai like floral designs. The <br />paintings at Kupgal, Maski, Piklihal etc., include the long humped <br />bulls (Bos Indicus) and Rams. The principal colour used is Red <br />predominantly pigment based. All these are indicative of fire-cult. <br />The presence of Copper and Gold ornaments proves the knowledge of <br />metal working with fire under controlled temperatures.<br /><br /> <br /><br />27.1. The megalithic culture has abundant evidences for fire-cult. <br />Ferrous and non-ferrous technology proves the extensive application <br />of heat energy knowing its complete knowledge as evidenced by many <br />excavated samples of tools, implements, vessels, jewelry etc. <br />Tridents and lances found are associated with fire-cult, as they are <br />connected with goddess-worship and Veriyadal. Iron bells also show <br />the religious connection. The bronzes exhibit high degree of skill <br />in metal working, include small cups, bowls, jars etc., with lids up <br />to 9 inches. They are with triangular incised designs. The lids have <br />animal motifs including cocks and sheep/ Rams with twisted horns are <br />found on the bronze articles. Rectangular stone objects smeared with <br />a thick coat of red ochre are also found. Pottery has the same <br />designs as noted above. Three legged jars, vessels and small urns <br />may represent fire-god, as Agni is supposed to have three legs. A <br />Ram shaped sarcophagus has been found with detachable head portion. <br />The cow shaped sarcophagus and elephant legged are also associated <br />with fire-cult, as cow is connected with yagnas and elephant with <br />Murugan and Analan (Agni). The terracotta figures also include Ram, <br />sheep, unicorn, humped bulls, mother goddess. At some places <br />polished stones are kept for worship considered as thunderbolts or <br />missiles of fire-god and they are found even today in village <br />temples.<br /><br /> <br /><br />27.2. For firing of pottery up to 8000C to 9000C temperature is <br />required; for manufacture of glass of the order 1350-15000C and <br />ferrous and non-ferrous metal working up to 18000C temperature <br />required under controlled conditions. For getting different colours <br />of beads, different chemicals must have been added. All these <br />processes cannot be done without any facility of handling high <br />temperature equipments. Copper wire and rings, gold ornaments, <br />bronze articles etc., prove the intricate metal working and <br />processes14.<br /><br /> <br /><br />27.3. The pre-historic rock paintings found in different parts of <br />Tamilnadu (South Arcot, Coimbatore and Dharmapuri) dated back to c. <br />2500 BCE and painted in ochre-red colour have many fire related <br />depictions. They clearly show the fire sacrifices and rituals, <br />Veriyadal and fire-god15.<br /><br /> <br /><br />28. Fire and Temple worship: As times are changed so also Gods and <br />connected rituals. As pure form of fire-worship has been regulated, <br />only assimilated and modified worship is observed today. Without <br />fire, perhaps, temple worship with rites, rituals and ceremonies, <br />whether according to Vedas or otherwise cannot be thought of. Temple <br />worship embodies all the religious and social aspects of human life. <br />Not only theological principles, but also philosophical intricacies <br />have been incorporated in it for the understanding of laymen with <br />simplicity. Particularly, the Panchbhuta worship is revealed in day <br />to day worship and traditional practices of the devotees: <br /><br /> <br /><br />Earth<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Water<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Fire<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Wind<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Sky<br />It is offered as such or in the form of holy ash, Kumkum etc., to <br />be applied on the forehead with veneration.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Associating with each temple, there is a tank, river or some thirth <br />(water source), in which the visiting devotees take bath, purifying <br />themselves before entering the temples. Invariably, there will be an <br />Agni thirth, besides other thirths. In fact, the tank itself is <br />divided into different areas with presiding deities, where the area <br />belonging to fire-god is significantly marked.<br /><br /> <br /><br />As has been mentioned, fire forms the basis of every worship. <br />Through fire only God is invoked. Different forms of lamps and <br />lights of various sizes, shapes and metals not only arranged and <br />kept, but also shown to the deity. Camphor-fire shown to deity is <br />offered to the devotees for venerable acceptance.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Chamras (fans) are waved to deity. God is invoked with mantras <br />treating vayu (air).<br /><br /> <br /><br />It is implied in the name "Kadavul" (One who is beyond <br />comprehension). Figuratively, empty space is shown to understand the <br />nature.<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />29. Inferences: Traditionally, the direction and angle of Fire <br />(Agni) is South-east. Therefore, the presence of fire-cult in that <br />area of India is not exaggerated. Geologically, the Southern part of <br />India is very old (and has been due to volcanic action) than the <br />north. The fire-cult must have been also been the oldest of any <br />civilization, heritage, culture and tradition, because of its <br />association with the man from the beginning. The fire-worship must <br />have been developed later with the ritualization of the cult. The <br />worship can be considered under naturalistic, Theriomorpohic, <br />anthromorphic, fetishistic and symbolic forms.<br /><br /> <br /><br />1. Naturalistic: <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />2. Theriomorphic: <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />3. Anthropomorphic: <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Fetishistic: <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Symbolic: <br /> <br />Fire worshipped s such connecting it with the Sun, Moon, starts, <br />other planets like Mars, mountain, waters etc.,<br /><br /> <br /><br />Ram, lephant (as vahanas of fire-god, Muruga), cattle connected with <br />yagna and Sun.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Se, Se Ey, Seyon, Shive Â– Masculine form.<br /><br />Sur, Anangu, Kollippavai, Arunthati, Salini, Pattini,, Kotravai, <br />Kadukizhal, Pazhaiyol, Ayirai etc., - Feminine form.<br /><br />The personification of fire led to ultimate deification. Recognizing <br />the natural phenomenon, such process must have been in turn divided <br />into masculine and feminine forms. In the course of time, the <br />combination and permutation of masculine and feminine natures led to <br />further multiplication and unification of Gods and Goddesses <br />depending upon the nature, geographical location of the place, <br />availability of natural resources and so on.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Literally evidences of idols Â– of Anangu (Agam.159:5-6); Pattini <br />(Padit.Padigam.5:4); Kollippavai (Natri.201:5-11, 192:8-9, 185:11); <br />Pavai (Ingu.221); <br /><br />Image of gold (Agam.212:1, Madu.410; Natri.192:8: a Pandya king <br />seizes an image from Musiri after a war (Agam.149:12), manufacture <br />of an Idol (Madu.723-74).<br /><br />According to Agama sastra, the image of Fire-god (Agni) should be <br />there in the south-east among the Parivara deities and in Gopuras. <br />Agni is found in the gopuras of Darasuram and Kailasanatha temples. <br />In Tiruppugalur, there is one Agni idol with two heads, six eyes, <br />seven tongues, four horns, big belly and three legs. In Chennimalai <br />temple, God Muruga has two heads and is known as Agneswaran.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Fire is symbolically represented by triangles, wavy lines to denote <br />flames and fire-pits; Swastika and Om are indirect representations. <br />The three fires Agvaniyam, Garukapatyam and Dakshinagni are <br />represented by square, semi-circle and triangle. In temples, <br />southern quarters contain homasthana (the place for yagna) with <br />nityagnigunta (perpetual fire-pit) for agnicarya (the daily fire <br />sacrifices).<br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br />30. Conclusions: In view of the above literary, archaeological and <br />other evidences presented, discussed and explained, the following <br />conclusions are drawn: <br /><br /> <br /><br />Fire-cult is one of the earliest forms of worship of the ancient <br />Tamils.<br /> <br /><br />Formation of fire-god concept and his characteristics may be unique <br />and independently developed.<br /> <br /><br />Ritualization of fire-cult led to the yagna oriented sacrifices. <br />Veriyadal may be the reminiscence of such cult and Kalavelvi an <br />imitation.<br /> <br /><br />The technical advancement and capacity of handling temperatures of <br />the order of 1500 to 18000C may upset the Neolithic and megalithic <br />barriers.<br /> <br /><br />Anthropomorphic form of fire-cult in both masculine and feminine <br />nature led to the origin of pantheistic mode of worship with <br />increasing Gods and Goddesses.<br /> <br /><br />Masculine forms of fire-god are Se, Se Ey, Seyon, Sevvel, Neduvel <br />etc.<br /> <br /><br />Feminine form of fire-god (goddesses) are Sur, Anangu, Kollippavai, <br />Arunthati, Salini, Surara magalir, Varaiyara magilar, Vanara <br />magalir, Kotravai, Pazhaiyol, Kaduraikkadavul, Oru mulai arutta <br />Tiruma unni, Pattini, Sapta kanniyar and so on. The lengthy list of <br />goddesses proves the continuous popularity of them not only in <br />earlier times, but also today.<br /> <br /><br />The concept of Kodinilai, Kandazhi and Valli is unique in the fire-<br />cult of the ancient Tamils leading to other philosophical musings.<br /> <br /><br />The change and interchange of anthropomorphic worship is noted in <br />the case of fire-god to Se, Se Ey or Seyon; Anangu or Sur to Seyon; <br />Seyon as the son of the combination of the God residing under Banyan <br />tree and Kotravai.<br /> <br /><br />The above evidences show that Anangu, Sur and Sey were cast into <br />crucible after synthesizing and reconciling the characters to bring <br />out Murugu an Murugan.<br /> <br /><br />The attribution and comparison of fiery characteristics to and with <br />Stars, Planets and Gods form the basis of development of theology.<br /> <br /><br />The fire representing words might have been developed in <br />representing such factors, as they have different meanings including <br />fire and characters of fire and stars and planets.<br /> <br /><br />Temple worship embodies every aspect of fire physically, <br />philosophically and theologically.<br /> <br /><br />Fire-cult is explicit in rural areas, but implicit in urban areas. <br />Fire-walking ceremony may be the left-out practice of Sati in a new <br />garb, as in the literature itself exemption in the form of Kaimmai <br />nonbu was given to widows.<br /> <br /><br />Modified forms of fire-related festivals are Bhogi, Pongal, Holi, <br />Rathyatras, Deepavali and Karttigai. Tiruvannamalai, Sabarimalai <br />etc., stand proof for periodical burnings on the hills.<br /> <br /><br />Notes and References<br /><br /> <br /><br />For convenience, the important literary references are given in the <br />brackets at the end of a sentence or sentences.<br /> <br /><br />The abbreviations used for each work is as follows: <br /><br /> <br /><br />Tolkappiyam - Tol<br /><br /> <br /><br />Ettuttogai<br /><br /> <br /><br />Natrinai - Natri.<br />Kuruntogai Â– Kuru.<br />Ingurunuru - Ingu.<br />Paditruppattu - Padit.<br />Paripadal - Pari.<br />Kalittogai - Kali.<br />Agananuru Â– A gam.<br />Purananuru Â– Puram.<br />Pattuppattu<br /><br />Tirumurugatruppadai.<br />Porunatruppadai.<br />Sirupanatruppadai.<br />Perumbanatruppadai.<br />Mullaippattu.<br />Maduraikanchi.<br />Nedunalvadai.<br />Kurinchippattu.<br />Pattinapattu.<br />10. Malaipadukadam.<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />The term `Shiva' is not found in the "Sangam" literature, but in <br />Tevaam, Tiruvacagam etc., of 7th Â– 8th century works. As a part of <br />continuation of masculine form of fire-worship, the crematory <br />grounds which were supposed to be the dwelling places of Shiva might <br />have been converted into temples. Tirukkollikkadu, <br />Tiruthalaichangadu, Tiruttalaiyalangadu, Tiruvanniyur, <br />Tiruvelvikkudi Â– names clearly prove the connection of fire-worship <br />of one form or the other. Even the presiding deities have the <br />appellations of fire e.g, Tiyadiappar, Angneswarar etc.<br /> <br /><br />Tolkappiyam makes a specific reference about virtuous wife entering <br />into the flames of the funeral pyre of her husband <br />(Tol.Porul.Purat.79). When Chera and Chola kings died fighting, <br />their wives performed Sati (Puram.62:13-16). Other references are - <br />Ay Aindiran and his wives (Puram.240); Perungoppendu (Puram.246 & <br />247); request for manufacture of big crematory urn to bury along <br />with her husband (Puram.256); a widow prepares to die rather than to <br />follow Kaimmai (Puram.280); a monkey performs Sati (Kuru.69).
