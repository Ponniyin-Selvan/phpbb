			<div class="content">Hi<br />This is mainly with respect to the question "Who is<br />Nandini?" The answer to this is not very simple I<br />guess (if u go by what the History actually would have<br />been)and a lot of things have to be brought to light<br />before answering this.<br />Instead of answering this question I would like to<br />write a lot other things i learnt in the last couple<br />of days during my travel to the Chola kingdom of<br />Rajaraja chola....I had been on a religious trip to<br />some temples near kudanthai n trichy and i happened to<br />see the Pallippadai which Rajendra chola, son of raja<br />raja chola has built for Panchavanmaadevi (one of the<br />wives of Rajarajan). The question now is why did<br />rajendra build a temple for only one of his<br />stepmothers(n note it : not even for his mother?) n<br />even then why only to this stepmother?! Please try n<br />ponder over it...<br />In the meanwhile i will try n compose a mail of<br />all that i have learnt in the past few days from Mr.<br />Sundhar Bhardawaj, who is an ardent fan of kalki, a<br />very close friend of Balakumaran n who is spending a<br />lot of his efforts in unearthing the chola history<br />especially around the time of rajaraja chola...<br />I am not as good a story teller as he is... but i<br />will try my best n pass on the information to you<br />asap...<br />Bye till then<br />Lavanya<br /><br /><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Chola history lovers,<br />This is a sort of continuation to the last mail I<br />sent you... Please remember this is only a very<br />feasible theory...<br />During the war against the Pandyas, where "Veera<br />Pandiyan" was defeated(which is quoted in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> also),<br />sundara chozha had sent his son Aadithya Karikaalan<br />and his brother Kandaraathithya Chozha's offspring<br />Madhuraanthagan(later Uttama Chozha) to win the war<br />against the Pandyas. Thw war was won but Veera<br />Pandiyan had escaped. It was Aditya who chased him to<br />his hiding and killed him. In the meanwhile, we should<br />remember that the mixup of characters need not have<br />happened at all. The original Madhuraanthagan must<br />really have wanted the kingdom and so when<br />aadithya(the crowned orince then) went on tis chase,<br />he might have got in touch with the terrorists like<br />Ravidhasan who must have promised Madhuraanthagan to<br />win his kingdom back by killing the crown prince. The<br />fact that Uttama chozhan had given Ravidhasan a very<br />high position and gave hime control which is valid<br />over all the three chozha regions( the original chozha<br />empire, the extended chozha empire and the foreign<br />lands like lanka n other islands captured by the<br />chozha empire). There is a kalvetttu to prove this.<br />will touchupon this point later.<br />Rajarajan must have sensed the danger from Uttama<br />Chozhan who removed Aniruddha Brahmaraayar n<br />appointed his own minister called Nakkan(i am sorry i<br />dont know his full name) who happens to have adopted<br />"Thillai Azhagi" ( a dancer) or Panchavanmadevi(one of<br />the wives of Rajaraja as mentioned in my previous<br />mail). Of course there might have been some subtle<br />means by which he finds out that the ruling king had<br />something to do with the murder of his brother<br />aadithya. So, he is also in a perpetual danger from<br />the king who would expect him to create problems and<br />would have always been watching his actions lest it<br />should disturb his rule. During sich a time, he must<br />have married this panchavanmadevi mostly for political<br />reasons. Her father, the minister must have helped in<br />revealing the secrets of the king and the most<br />powerful minister (ravidhaasan). When he comes to<br />power he captures all the lands of this minister and<br />his asociates and makes all his family leave the<br />country. This is there in one kalvettu. This kalvettu<br />only speaks of Ravidhasan as holding the high<br />positions in Uttama Chozhas rule. (as i had quoted<br />earlier in this mail). Thus Panchavanmaadevi became<br />the queen to help restore Rajarajan to power and help<br />take revenge of his brother's murder. But she had<br />promised that she wouldnt create any sort of<br />competition to Rajendra chozha's rule. Moreover,<br />Rajendra was also brought up y this queen. That is why<br />Rajendra had a spl. comsideration and created a<br />pallipadai for this great queen.<br />that is it for this mail, more in other mails.<br />Regards<br />Lavanya<br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div>

Of course there might have been some subtle<br />    means by which he finds out that the ruling king<br />  had<br />    something to do with the murder of his brother<br />    aadithya. So, he is also in a perpetual danger<br />  from<br />    the king who would expect him to create problems<br />  and<br />    would have always been watching his actions lest<br />  it<br />    should disturb his rule.

But we<br />do not know for sure that It was not senthan amudhan.<br /><br />also, the people of chola Kingdom were totally<br />against Maduranthakan because of his conspiracy<br />against sons of sundara chola.<br /><br />So, I am still finding it very difficult to beleive<br />that senthan amudan never existed. I also know the<br />fact that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is also a fiction based on Chols Empire.<br />But I dont agree that since kalki likes cholas very<br />much, he has not written bad about uttama chola.Though<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a master piece, Kalki has written about other<br />kings also. Even in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, he has written lot of bad<br />things about Adiththa karikala - showing him as a<br />Lunatic, and becuase of that people's support was more<br />for rajaRaja.<br /><br />Adiththa karikalan is also a chola King....!!!<br /><br />ANyway, thanks for the Response.

That<br />  is<br />      why<br />      Rajendra had a spl. comsideration and created a<br />      pallipadai for this great queen.<br />      that is it for this mail, more in other mails.<br />      Regards<br />      Lavanya<br />     <br />     <br />  __________________________________________________<br />      Do You Yahoo!?<br />      Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --><br />     <br />   <br />   <br />    =====<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    JOIN THIS INTERESTING GROUP FOR<br />   <br />    HOT DISCUSSIONS ON TAMIL LITERATURE<br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RayarKaapiKlub/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RayarKaapiKlub/</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />   <br />    __________________________________________________<br />    Do You Yahoo!?<br />    Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --><br />   <br /> <br /> <br />  __________________________________________________<br />  Do You Yahoo!?<br />  Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote><br />=====<br /><br /><br /><br />JOIN THIS INTERESTING GROUP FOR<br /><br />HOT DISCUSSIONS ON TAMIL LITERATURE<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RayarKaapiKlub/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RayarKaapiKlub/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div>
