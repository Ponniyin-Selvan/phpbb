Many archaeological remains, records of travellers, and <br />texts and inscriptions in Indian languages existing in all Eastern <br />Asia are direct testimonies of this fact. Borrowings of Indian words <br />in the languages of this part of the world, and Indian features in <br />the original arts of many countries are also indirect evidence of <br />the same fact.<br /><br />In the first part of the last century the view was generally <br />accepted among scholars that the main current of Indian culture <br />towards the East had been Buddhistic. It seemed sure Hindu religion, <br />as deriving from the Vedic or Brahmanical one, was not a missionary <br />religion and was not exported from India. It was easy in order to <br />support this opinion to quote from Manu or from the other later <br />sources in the literature of the Dharmasastras prohibiting sea <br />voyage for brahmans. But in fact, this opinion was wrong. Since the <br />second part of the last century a lot of brahmanical remains and <br />Sanskrit Hindu inscriptions were recorded in South-east Asia and <br />Indonesia. Even literal Vedic quotations appear in Indo-Chinese and <br />Indonesian documents. The only problem which remained till recently <br />was how to reconcile the prohibition of exportation of Vedic lore <br />beyond the seas with the fact of this very exportation, and by whom <br />the Vedic, Brahmanical and Hindu religions were brought and <br />established in South-east Asia.<br /><br />This last problem is now going to be solved, thanks to Tamil <br />research and to Sanskrit research in Tamil Nadu, as well as in the <br />S.E. Asia itself. At first Tamil research had not been considered as <br />very important in this matter because, in South-east Asia, Sanskrit <br />inscriptions referring only to Sanskrit literature are much more <br />numerous than the Tamil ones which also are ordinarily of later <br />dates. So, it seemed the main influence from India towards the East <br />was from Northern India. Tamilians themselves called Sanskrit <br />vadamoli (`Northern Language'). But that does not mean they have not <br />used it. On the contrary, if we draw a complete enquiry into the <br />culture of Tamil Nad as it was all along the centuries, we observe <br />Tamil pulavars not only have produced Tamil masterpieces of poetry <br />and learning, but also have contributed much in Sanskrit to <br />Literature and Philosophy. We have just to refer to the names of <br />such great philosophers of world fame as Sankaracarya or Ramanuja, <br />or to authors like Dandin who were ubhayakavi.<br /><br />Moreover we must observe when Tamilians wrote in Sanskrit they were <br />not always nearly following a Northern tradition. Very often they <br />simply used Sanskrit as a language of general communication in order <br />to more widely propagate ideas from their own tradition. RÃƒÂ£mÃƒÂ£nuja, <br />for example, gave a scholastical Sanskrit garment to the theology of <br />Nammalvar who inspired him and who before him had sung in his love <br />for God:<br /><br />uyarvara uyarnalam utaiyavan yavan avan mayarvara matinalam arulinan <br />yavan avan ayarvarum amararkal atipati yavan avan tuyararu cutarati <br />tolutu eluen maname<br /><br />Let us now consider the most ancient of the Sanskrit inscriptions of <br />Indo-China which was found at Vocanh near the eastern coast of the <br />Indo-Chinese peninsula in Vietnam. According to palaeographical <br />evidence it belongs to the second or third century A.D. The shape of <br />the characters does not clearly indicate if the writing was <br />introduced from South India or from any other part of India. But the <br />contents of the inscription are significant. In spite of the fact <br />the lines are not all well preserved we have the name of the king <br />who ordered to carve out the text. This name is Sri Mara. At the <br />beginning of the study of this inscription, it was thought the king <br />was a Buddhist because he was praising 'compassion', karuna. The <br />name 'Mara' also seemed to evolve Buddhism. But it would have been <br />very strange if the king had designated himself as Mara, that is, as <br />an enemy of Buddhism. We know karuna, corresponding to the Tamil <br />arul, is Brahmanical or Hindu as well as Buddhistic, and the name <br />Mara in Sanskrit must now be recognised as merely being a <br />transliteration of the famous Tamil title of Pandyan kings MaRaN. <br />Because the letter R. of Tamil MaRaN is lacking in Sanskrit it was <br />replaced by the other one and so the Tamil word became similar to <br />the name of the Buddha's antagonist who was surely there out of <br />consideration.<br /><br />The use of the Sanskrit language by Tamilians and the introduction <br />of a famous Tamil royal title under a Sanskrit garment was quite <br />natural at the time, that is, in the first centuries of the Saka <br />era. In this period not only the Dravidian languages were by their <br />very origin different from the Indo-Aryan ones but also they most <br />probably were already highly differentiated from each other. Above <br />all, the Indoaryan Prakrits of the North, also in use in the South <br />with the Jain Ardhamagadhi and with the Buddhistic Pali, were much <br />different from each other. Only Sanskrit was known at least by <br />educated peoples everywhere and regularly taught in special schools <br />as the same throughout India. It was the only means of general <br />communication as Latin has been during centuries in Europe and as <br />English is today in the greatest part of the world; Sanskrit was <br />used for secular and practical purposes, owing to this character of <br />common language medium. In most of the official inscriptions it <br />replaced the Prakrits and, at the same time, the compromise between <br />the old Buddhist Prakrit text and the widespread usage of the <br />classical Sanskrit gave birth to the so called Buddhist hybrid <br />Sanskrit which was gradually replaced by classical Sanskrit itself.<br /><br />In Tamilnad, both Tamil and Sanskrit were classical. Intercourse <br />between the Tamil kingdom and the Magadha kingdom are evidenced <br />since the end of the fourth century B.C. The famous Greek ambassador <br />to the court of Candragupta heard at Pataliputra the story of <br />Tadadakai, i.e. Minatci of the Pandyan kingdom, without having ever <br />visited this country. In the middle of the third century B.C. <br />Asoka's inscriptions refer to the three Tamil kingdoms. Brahmanical <br />lore was then well known in the South, at least in Kalinga, since <br />Asoka has expressed his sorrow for the death of many brahmans during <br />his war to conquer Kalinga.<br /><br />In any case, many poems in the Sangam Literature show us how wide <br />and deep was the knowledge some Tamil pulavars had of the Vedic and <br />Sanskrit culture. They often refer to Vedic rites, rising in these <br />references either Tamil or Sanskrit words, saying velvi or yagam, <br />kelvi or Suruti, maRai or Veda etc., indifferently. The sixth poem <br />of Pura nanuru, by Karikilar, in honour of Pandiyan Palyakacalai <br />Mutukutumi Peruvaluti, shows us that this king followed Siva's cult <br />and also patronised, at the same time, Vedic ritual.<br /><br />According to the tradition, the Vedic ritual is intended for general <br />welfare of the kingdom, i.e. for Bhakti the Siva's cult rests upon <br />the Agamas and leads to reach both Bhakti and Mukti, the Supreme <br />Goal. In Tamilnad, both Vedic and Agamic rituals were prescribed in <br />Sanskrit books, but the religious feelings, the utterances of <br />devotion of BHAKTI to God have been sung in Tamil by devotees like <br />the Nayanmar and the Alvar. Tamil has been the language of the <br />heart, Sanskrit the medium of technical teaching and official <br />proclamations. Both were mastered by Tamilians everywhere they went. <br />Abroad, they naturally<br />used Sanskrit for official and practical purposes and our <br />epigraphical remains are mainly official. That is why they are <br />chiefly in Sanskrit. In these conditions, no wonder if we find <br />explanations of many things in South-east Asia through researches <br />both in Tamil and in the Sanskrit literature of the Tamilnad.<br /><br />That is the case for example in Ancient Cambodia or Kambujadesa. In <br />this country, at the very beginning of the ninth century, in A.D. <br />802 according to several Sanskrit or old Cambodian inscriptions, the <br />king Jayavarman 11 ordered for the performances of a ritual for the <br />establishment of the devaraja on a mountain called Mahendraparvata. <br />This devaraja is subsequently referred to in other inscriptions as <br />established in various places in the shape of a linga by different <br />kings. DÃƒÂ©varaja, 'King of Gods' is a usual designation of Indra, but <br />in spite of the fact the mountain was called after Mahendra, it was <br />not possible to accept an identification of this devaraja with <br />Indra. On another side, the parallel designation of the devaraja in <br />old Cambodian inscriptions was kamaratan jagat to raja which <br />means 'the Lord of Universe who is king.' So, it was supposed and <br />generally admitted till recently that raja was applying to the human <br />Cambodian king and a new proposed translation of devaraja was 'the <br />king who is God', 'the divine king.' It was taken for granted that <br />the corresponding linga established in the name of the king was a <br />material symbol embodying the personal essence of the king or the <br />essence of the kingship.<br /><br />But we find in Tamil literature a much easier solution. <br />Manikkavacakar, in his Tiruvacakam refers several times to Siva as <br />seating on the Mayentiram mountain, i.e. the Mahendraparvata, as the <br />king of Gods, these Gods being enumerated as Brahma, Vishnu and <br />Indra. Also at the same time, Siva is the real king of the country <br />as well as of the whole universe. So, Jayavarman II has simply <br />performed a Sivalingasthapanam following a conception which is <br />revealed to us by Manikkavacakar and not the classical Sanskrit <br />sources, so far as we know. This does not mean that this <br />representation of Siva was only Tamil and proper to Manikkavacakar. <br />Tamilians were not coming alone from India to Cambodia. We have also <br />clear references in the inscriptions of Indians originating from <br />other parts of India, and the Saivite religion belongs to all India. <br />But we know by this example that researches in Tamil literature are <br />necessary to improve our knowledge of the intercourse between India <br />and South-east Asia. Tamil too is a repository of universal Indian <br />culture.<br /><br />The researches in the technical books in Sanskrit which are <br />preserved chiefly in Tamilnad, e.g. Sivagamas and Pancaratragamas, <br />are also fruitful in order to understand many features of the old <br />remains of Hindu religion in South-east Asia and Indonesia. For <br />example there are in Cambodia huge temples in the shape of pyramids <br />representing the Meru, according to an all Indian conception. But <br />some among them which seemed, according to some inscriptions, or <br />traditions, as being tombs as well as temples, are just built in the <br />way prescribed in the Agamas for the Samadhis of Yatis or of men <br />having obtained Sivadiksa. According to the Agamas as summarised in <br />the Kriyadipika composed by Sivagrayogi of the Tamil <br />Kailayaparamparai these samadhis may become temples. In Tamilnad <br />there are numerous samadhis like that, but they are ordinarily small <br />and do not become centres of temples because there are many ancient <br />holy places and temples. In Cambodia, on the contrary, where there <br />were no holy traditional places for Hindu cults before the coming of <br />Hindu people, the possibility to bury men having been turned into <br />Siva himself by Agamic rites and to build temples on their Samadhis <br />was a good way to consecrate the holy as required for the cult.<br /><br />This cult was finally abandoned when the countries of South-east <br />Asia were converted to Theravada Buddhism or to Islam. But Thailand <br />and Cambodia have continued to appoint groups of brahmans for Royal <br />and State Ceremonies. It is a well known fact these brahmans have <br />preserved ritual books in Sanskrit in the Grantha characters which <br />belong exclusively to Tamilnad. According to the traditions, the <br />ancestors of most of them came from places like Ramesvaram or <br />Ramanathapuram. Some of them claimed to come from Kailasa; that <br />means their ancestors belonged to the Kailasa or Kailayaparampara of <br />Dharmapuram and TiruvatutuRai. They cannot be considered as brahmans <br />in the strict sense of the Dharmasastra, but brahman has become <br />since centuries an ordinary designation of Hindu religionists in <br />South-east Asia. So Brahmana is very often in Chinese and Arabic <br />sources a reference to Indian peoples of Hindu religion. In Cambodia <br />these brahmans are also called baku according to the modern <br />pronounciation, and pakuva according to the orthography. It is easy <br />to recognise in this last designation Tamil pakkuvar, fit to term in <br />the Saivasiddhantic use those who are 'ripe' (Sanskrit, pakva) and <br />entitled to perform rites involving Vedic and Agamic mantras.<br /><br />The books of these people are actually full of Vedic and Agamic <br />quotations. Prof. T. P. Meenakshisundaram has already published a <br />book in Tamil on the festival called in Thailand Tiruppavai-<br />Tiruvempavai and brought further information on the subject in this <br />Conference.<br /><br />In Bali, Indonesia, the religion of Hindu origin which is still <br />practised in called Agamatirtha. The word tirtha is also used to <br />designate holy water received from the temple. Such a use is not <br />general in India for the word tirtha, but it exists in Tamil. There <br />are other evidences in South-east Asia and Indonesia of the coming <br />of Sanskrit words through Tamilians with the specialisations or <br />changes of meaning they have undergone.<br /><br />So, the role played by the Tamilians in the relations between India <br />and South-east Asia, though by no means exclusive, has been very <br />great even when they have used Sanskrit to present their culture in <br />these countries .<br /><br />This role has also been extended till the Far East. Little known <br />archeological and epigraphical discoveries enable us now to trade <br />the evidence of this role in China. Marco Polo, the famous Venitian <br />traveller of the end of the thirteenth century had described in the <br />narration of his travel a town, Zayton, in South China which was at <br />the time a very important international market where merchants came <br />from every part of Asia and where a strong group of Indian merchants <br />were established. Marco Polo did not indicate the regions of India <br />they came from. <br /><br />Fortunately we may now be sure at least many of them were Tamilians. <br />One surrounding wall was built around the town in the fifteenth <br />century with stone material taken from ancient buildings. During the <br />last Sino-Japanese war a part of this wall was demolished and many <br />old architectural and epigraphical remains were discovered. A few <br />years ago a Chinese archeologist published many pictures and notices <br />of these findings. Among them we find a lot of pillars of temples, <br />divine images and elements of the basis of a very large temple of <br />South Indian style, slightly modified by Chinese artists who were <br />employed in the building or sculpturing. <br /><br />There is an ancient image of Mahavisnu, and more recent <br />representations of lingas or of scenes like gajendramoksnam or <br />robbing by Kona of the clothes of the the Gopis, etc. Also two <br />plates with Tamil inscriptions were discovered. Photographs of these <br />inscriptions are not complete and no full phrase is readable, but <br />one inscription mentions Perumal, the other gives a part of a date <br />(cittirai masam). Thanks to these discoveries which give the hope of <br />further studies we know the Indian merchants seen by Marco Polo had <br />established both the Vaishnavite and Saivite cult, and were mostly <br />Tamilians though it is by no means excluded that peoples of other <br />parts of India have also been there, along with merchants from <br />Central Asia, Persia and even Arabia.<br /><br />These few examples may be enough to give us evidence of the need for <br />a larger and international investigation to try to cover the immense <br />field of human activity in which Tamil speakers have co-operated <br />with nations during so many centuries.<br /><br />That is why we are happy to be now for the first time at Kuala <br />Lumpur in a position to hold this International Conference-Seminar <br />of Tamil Studies and to obtain the precious co-operation of so many <br />scholars of various horizons.</div>

Many archaeological remains, records of travellers, and<br />texts and inscriptions in Indian languages existing in all Eastern<br />Asia are direct testimonies of this fact. Borrowings of Indian words<br />in the languages of this part of the world, and Indian features in<br />the original arts of many countries are also indirect evidence of<br />the same fact.<br /><br />In the first part of the last century the view was generally<br />accepted among scholars that the main current of Indian culture<br />towards the East had been Buddhistic. It seemed sure Hindu religion,<br />as deriving from the Vedic or Brahmanical one, was not a missionary<br />religion and was not exported from India. It was easy in order to<br />support this opinion to quote from Manu or from the other later<br />sources in the literature of the Dharmasastras prohibiting sea<br />voyage for brahmans. But in fact, this opinion was wrong. Since the<br />second part of the last century a lot of brahmanical remains and<br />Sanskrit Hindu inscriptions were recorded in South-east Asia and<br />Indonesia. Even literal Vedic quotations appear in Indo-Chinese and<br />Indonesian documents. The only problem which remained till recently<br />was how to reconcile the prohibition of exportation of Vedic lore<br />beyond the seas with the fact of this very exportation, and by whom<br />the Vedic, Brahmanical and Hindu religions were brought and<br />established in South-east Asia.<br /><br />This last problem is now going to be solved, thanks to Tamil<br />research and to Sanskrit research in Tamil Nadu, as well as in the<br />S.E. Asia itself. At first Tamil research had not been considered as<br />very important in this matter because, in South-east Asia, Sanskrit<br />inscriptions referring only to Sanskrit literature are much more<br />numerous than the Tamil ones which also are ordinarily of later<br />dates. So, it seemed the main influence from India towards the East<br />was from Northern India. Tamilians themselves called Sanskrit<br />vadamoli (`Northern Language'). But that does not mean they have not<br />used it. On the contrary, if we draw a complete enquiry into the<br />culture of Tamil Nad as it was all along the centuries, we observe<br />Tamil pulavars not only have produced Tamil masterpieces of poetry<br />and learning, but also have contributed much in Sanskrit to<br />Literature and Philosophy. We have just to refer to the names of<br />such great philosophers of world fame as Sankaracarya or Ramanuja,<br />or to authors like Dandin who were ubhayakavi.<br /><br />Moreover we must observe when Tamilians wrote in Sanskrit they were<br />not always nearly following a Northern tradition. Very often they<br />simply used Sanskrit as a language of general communication in order<br />to more widely propagate ideas from their own tradition. RÃƒÂ£mÃƒÂ£nuja,<br />for example, gave a scholastical Sanskrit garment to the theology of<br />Nammalvar who inspired him and who before him had sung in his love<br />for God:<br /><br />uyarvara uyarnalam utaiyavan yavan avan mayarvara matinalam arulinan<br />yavan avan ayarvarum amararkal atipati yavan avan tuyararu cutarati<br />tolutu eluen maname<br /><br />Let us now consider the most ancient of the Sanskrit inscriptions of<br />Indo-China which was found at Vocanh near the eastern coast of the<br />Indo-Chinese peninsula in Vietnam. According to palaeographical<br />evidence it belongs to the second or third century A.D. The shape of<br />the characters does not clearly indicate if the writing was<br />introduced from South India or from any other part of India. But the<br />contents of the inscription are significant. In spite of the fact<br />the lines are not all well preserved we have the name of the king<br />who ordered to carve out the text. This name is Sri Mara. At the<br />beginning of the study of this inscription, it was thought the king<br />was a Buddhist because he was praising 'compassion', karuna. The<br />name 'Mara' also seemed to evolve Buddhism. But it would have been<br />very strange if the king had designated himself as Mara, that is, as<br />an enemy of Buddhism. We know karuna, corresponding to the Tamil<br />arul, is Brahmanical or Hindu as well as Buddhistic, and the name<br />Mara in Sanskrit must now be recognised as merely being a<br />transliteration of the famous Tamil title of Pandyan kings MaRaN.<br />Because the letter R. of Tamil MaRaN is lacking in Sanskrit it was<br />replaced by the other one and so the Tamil word became similar to<br />the name of the Buddha's antagonist who was surely there out of<br />consideration.<br /><br />The use of the Sanskrit language by Tamilians and the introduction<br />of a famous Tamil royal title under a Sanskrit garment was quite<br />natural at the time, that is, in the first centuries of the Saka<br />era. In this period not only the Dravidian languages were by their<br />very origin different from the Indo-Aryan ones but also they most<br />probably were already highly differentiated from each other. Above<br />all, the Indoaryan Prakrits of the North, also in use in the South<br />with the Jain Ardhamagadhi and with the Buddhistic Pali, were much<br />different from each other. Only Sanskrit was known at least by<br />educated peoples everywhere and regularly taught in special schools<br />as the same throughout India. It was the only means of general<br />communication as Latin has been during centuries in Europe and as<br />English is today in the greatest part of the world; Sanskrit was<br />used for secular and practical purposes, owing to this character of<br />common language medium. In most of the official inscriptions it<br />replaced the Prakrits and, at the same time, the compromise between<br />the old Buddhist Prakrit text and the widespread usage of the<br />classical Sanskrit gave birth to the so called Buddhist hybrid<br />Sanskrit which was gradually replaced by classical Sanskrit itself.<br /><br />In Tamilnad, both Tamil and Sanskrit were classical. Intercourse<br />between the Tamil kingdom and the Magadha kingdom are evidenced<br />since the end of the fourth century B.C. The famous Greek ambassador<br />to the court of Candragupta heard at Pataliputra the story of<br />Tadadakai, i.e. Minatci of the Pandyan kingdom, without having ever<br />visited this country. In the middle of the third century B.C.<br />Asoka's inscriptions refer to the three Tamil kingdoms. Brahmanical<br />lore was then well known in the South, at least in Kalinga, since<br />Asoka has expressed his sorrow for the death of many brahmans during<br />his war to conquer Kalinga.<br /><br />In any case, many poems in the Sangam Literature show us how wide<br />and deep was the knowledge some Tamil pulavars had of the Vedic and<br />Sanskrit culture. They often refer to Vedic rites, rising in these<br />references either Tamil or Sanskrit words, saying velvi or yagam,<br />kelvi or Suruti, maRai or Veda etc., indifferently. The sixth poem<br />of Pura nanuru, by Karikilar, in honour of Pandiyan Palyakacalai<br />Mutukutumi Peruvaluti, shows us that this king followed Siva's cult<br />and also patronised, at the same time, Vedic ritual.<br /><br />According to the tradition, the Vedic ritual is intended for general<br />welfare of the kingdom, i.e. for Bhakti the Siva's cult rests upon<br />the Agamas and leads to reach both Bhakti and Mukti, the Supreme<br />Goal. In Tamilnad, both Vedic and Agamic rituals were prescribed in<br />Sanskrit books, but the religious feelings, the utterances of<br />devotion of BHAKTI to God have been sung in Tamil by devotees like<br />the Nayanmar and the Alvar. Tamil has been the language of the<br />heart, Sanskrit the medium of technical teaching and official<br />proclamations. Both were mastered by Tamilians everywhere they went.<br />Abroad, they naturally<br />used Sanskrit for official and practical purposes and our<br />epigraphical remains are mainly official. That is why they are<br />chiefly in Sanskrit. In these conditions, no wonder if we find<br />explanations of many things in South-east Asia through researches<br />both in Tamil and in the Sanskrit literature of the Tamilnad.<br /><br />That is the case for example in Ancient Cambodia or Kambujadesa. In<br />this country, at the very beginning of the ninth century, in A.D.<br />802 according to several Sanskrit or old Cambodian inscriptions, the<br />king Jayavarman 11 ordered for the performances of a ritual for the<br />establishment of the devaraja on a mountain called Mahendraparvata.<br />This devaraja is subsequently referred to in other inscriptions as<br />established in various places in the shape of a linga by different<br />kings. DÃƒÂ©varaja, 'King of Gods' is a usual designation of Indra, but<br />in spite of the fact the mountain was called after Mahendra, it was<br />not possible to accept an identification of this devaraja with<br />Indra. On another side, the parallel designation of the devaraja in<br />old Cambodian inscriptions was kamaratan jagat to raja which<br />means 'the Lord of Universe who is king.' So, it was supposed and<br />generally admitted till recently that raja was applying to the human<br />Cambodian king and a new proposed translation of devaraja was 'the<br />king who is God', 'the divine king.' It was taken for granted that<br />the corresponding linga established in the name of the king was a<br />material symbol embodying the personal essence of the king or the<br />essence of the kingship.<br /><br />But we find in Tamil literature a much easier solution.<br />Manikkavacakar, in his Tiruvacakam refers several times to Siva as<br />seating on the Mayentiram mountain, i.e. the Mahendraparvata, as the<br />king of Gods, these Gods being enumerated as Brahma, Vishnu and<br />Indra. Also at the same time, Siva is the real king of the country<br />as well as of the whole universe. So, Jayavarman II has simply<br />performed a Sivalingasthapanam following a conception which is<br />revealed to us by Manikkavacakar and not the classical Sanskrit<br />sources, so far as we know. This does not mean that this<br />representation of Siva was only Tamil and proper to Manikkavacakar.<br />Tamilians were not coming alone from India to Cambodia. We have also<br />clear references in the inscriptions of Indians originating from<br />other parts of India, and the Saivite religion belongs to all India.<br />But we know by this example that researches in Tamil literature are<br />necessary to improve our knowledge of the intercourse between India<br />and South-east Asia. Tamil too is a repository of universal Indian<br />culture.<br /><br />The researches in the technical books in Sanskrit which are<br />preserved chiefly in Tamilnad, e.g. Sivagamas and Pancaratragamas,<br />are also fruitful in order to understand many features of the old<br />remains of Hindu religion in South-east Asia and Indonesia. For<br />example there are in Cambodia huge temples in the shape of pyramids<br />representing the Meru, according to an all Indian conception. But<br />some among them which seemed, according to some inscriptions, or<br />traditions, as being tombs as well as temples, are just built in the<br />way prescribed in the Agamas for the Samadhis of Yatis or of men<br />having obtained Sivadiksa. According to the Agamas as summarised in<br />the Kriyadipika composed by Sivagrayogi of the Tamil<br />Kailayaparamparai these samadhis may become temples. In Tamilnad<br />there are numerous samadhis like that, but they are ordinarily small<br />and do not become centres of temples because there are many ancient<br />holy places and temples. In Cambodia, on the contrary, where there<br />were no holy traditional places for Hindu cults before the coming of<br />Hindu people, the possibility to bury men having been turned into<br />Siva himself by Agamic rites and to build temples on their Samadhis<br />was a good way to consecrate the holy as required for the cult.<br /><br />This cult was finally abandoned when the countries of South-east<br />Asia were converted to Theravada Buddhism or to Islam. But Thailand<br />and Cambodia have continued to appoint groups of brahmans for Royal<br />and State Ceremonies. It is a well known fact these brahmans have<br />preserved ritual books in Sanskrit in the Grantha characters which<br />belong exclusively to Tamilnad. According to the traditions, the<br />ancestors of most of them came from places like Ramesvaram or<br />Ramanathapuram. Some of them claimed to come from Kailasa; that<br />means their ancestors belonged to the Kailasa or Kailayaparampara of<br />Dharmapuram and TiruvatutuRai. They cannot be considered as brahmans<br />in the strict sense of the Dharmasastra, but brahman has become<br />since centuries an ordinary designation of Hindu religionists in<br />South-east Asia. So Brahmana is very often in Chinese and Arabic<br />sources a reference to Indian peoples of Hindu religion. In Cambodia<br />these brahmans are also called baku according to the modern<br />pronounciation, and pakuva according to the orthography. It is easy<br />to recognise in this last designation Tamil pakkuvar, fit to term in<br />the Saivasiddhantic use those who are 'ripe' (Sanskrit, pakva) and<br />entitled to perform rites involving Vedic and Agamic mantras.<br /><br />The books of these people are actually full of Vedic and Agamic<br />quotations. Prof. T. P. Meenakshisundaram has already published a<br />book in Tamil on the festival called in Thailand Tiruppavai-<br />Tiruvempavai and brought further information on the subject in this<br />Conference.<br /><br />In Bali, Indonesia, the religion of Hindu origin which is still<br />practised in called Agamatirtha. The word tirtha is also used to<br />designate holy water received from the temple. Such a use is not<br />general in India for the word tirtha, but it exists in Tamil. There<br />are other evidences in South-east Asia and Indonesia of the coming<br />of Sanskrit words through Tamilians with the specialisations or<br />changes of meaning they have undergone.<br /><br />So, the role played by the Tamilians in the relations between India<br />and South-east Asia, though by no means exclusive, has been very<br />great even when they have used Sanskrit to present their culture in<br />these countries .<br /><br />This role has also been extended till the Far East. Little known<br />archeological and epigraphical discoveries enable us now to trade<br />the evidence of this role in China. Marco Polo, the famous Venitian<br />traveller of the end of the thirteenth century had described in the<br />narration of his travel a town, Zayton, in South China which was at<br />the time a very important international market where merchants came<br />from every part of Asia and where a strong group of Indian merchants<br />were established.
