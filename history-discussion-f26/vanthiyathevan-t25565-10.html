When I called<br />    Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />    idiot, it was the character I was referring to. The<br />    character as portrayed<br />    by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be<br />    someone who is very<br />    brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to<br />    incident, mostly by<br />    chance. Again, this is the character we are talking<br />    about, not the<br />    historical personality <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />    <br />    Cheers,<br />    <br />    Arun<br />    <br />    On 12/31/06, sivaram Kannan <br />    wrote:<br />     <br />     <br />      Guess this is full stop to the topic.<br />     <br />     <br />      On 12/31/06, sridhar rathinam<br />     wrote:<br />       <br />        Dear Arun<br />        you can say anyone is an idiot if you just took<br />    one snap shot of their<br />        life...<br />       <br />        A stranger walks with a message in a hostile<br />    atmosphere...enters a<br />        hostile castle...by his own wit..... learns<br />    valauble information....it may<br />        be chance it may be fate....<br />        makes an oppurtunity from that by banging his<br />    horse on Ilayaranis<br />        pallakku......uses his wit and inteligence on<br />    Chinna paluvetarayar....saying<br />        his brother said to deliver the message in<br />    person.....delivers his message<br />        and gives a plausible explanation.....finds out<br />    he has lost the other<br />        message.....makes a trick and gets it from<br />    chinna paluvettarayar....gets out<br />        from his grip....gets to<br />    nandhini&#40;chance&#41;...resists her charm....into the<br />        nilavarai....&#40;chance&#41;<br />        resists the desire of worldly wealth...saves<br />    his freind....escapes from<br />        thanjavur....just because sendhan doesnt want to<br />    lie jumps into the<br />        river....fights Ravidasan and escapes.....tricks<br />    the dance company and<br />        disguises as Kamsan and meets IsanaPandithar and<br />    meets Kundavai and delivers<br />        the message!!!!!<br />       <br />        I am sure you have read all this before going to<br />    the second volume.....<br />       <br />        would you say Karikala wasnt valiant because a<br />    asiriri laed him to<br />        Virapandiyan?<br />       <br />        Ilayapallavan looses his sword to Kanjana<br />    devi.....is saved from the<br />        courts of Kalinga by Kanjana Devi.....is saved<br />    from death from the horses by<br />        Amir.....but he is alrger than life<br />       <br />        please for heavens sake stop calling him an<br />    idiot because however Kalki<br />        potrays him he was a great statsman and<br />    admistrater of the Mideaval Chola<br />        empire He was Rajendra&#39;s Samandhanayakar for<br />    gods sake<br />        regards<br />       <br />        Sri<br />       <br />        *Arun Krishnan *<br />    wrote:<br />       <br />        Well I am rereading it now.. &#40;<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> I mean&#41;.. and<br />    started the second<br />        book.. so Vanthiyathevan goes to Kodikkarai..<br />    meets Poonguzhali... falls<br />        into a ditch... is rescued by her.. she tells<br />    him about people looking for<br />        him..

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by sivan krishnaswami  using id sivankrishnaswami</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Hi Arun,<br />A very Happy New Year from Germany.<br /><br />I think you have started a discussion which will attract lot of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> devotees.<br /><br />I myself think it is not correct the way how use the word "bumbling idiot". Kalki created<br />the character <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> as a young man (ilam pillai) who is brave, playful, quick in wits and<br />cheeky. He is a sort of person who does things before thinking deeply about it. I mean at 20 I<br />wasnÂ´t much different. The youth, and adventurous nature makes people to react in such<br />manner. As you said if Karikalan would have sent Nambi instead of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> things would have<br />been different but in a different way of spin. Nambi is a perfect spy but not a warrior. As it is<br />mentioned <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> a warrior has been requested by Karikalan to bring the message to his father<br />at any means.<br /><br />Moreover if have read Alexandre DumasÂ´ The Three Muskeeters you will find that Kalki has<br />taken the character of DÃrtagnan and formed it in <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym>Â´s character. I mean you wouldnÂ´t call<br />DÃrtagnan a bumbling idiot because instead of looking after his own business he tends to<br />duell with almost everybody. As I recall the same situation of being a bumbling idiot happens<br />to him as well. I think DumasÂ´and Kalki tried to show their characters as being a young<br />fearless and cheeky sort of fellows who goes through walls with head if necessary.<br /><br />If you read the 5 th volume you will find the situation where <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is quite matured and at the<br />end as Manimegalai dies in his arms kalki writes as follows, " From: this moment (mani.m<br />is dead) vandhiya devan will be a different man. All his playfulness and recklessness will be<br />gone from him. He will be a very matured, thoughtful and kind hearted person. The spirit<br />of Manimekala deivam will be with him. ". This is also an example of kalkiÂ´s character of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym>.<br /><br />So please try to avoid saying <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is a bumbling idiot. It hurts people who are really fascinated<br />and sometimes takes a sort of time journey to these periods to feel and enjoy.<br /><br />with warm regards<br /><br />sivan krishnaswami<br /><br /><br />Arun Krishnan  schrieb:<br />I agree.. why should the discussion stop with this?:) the biggest strength of this group is to discuss even fairly controversial things in a very reasonable manner. <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Dear Sri,<br /><br />I jumped into volume two without rereading volume 1. So please wait a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> before I answer your Q. Also, as I read volume 2, and find more instances of bumbling idiocies :p I shall let you know.
