			<div class="content">Dear All<br />Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on <br />Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />Reagrds<br />Sri<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Vaithi<br /><br />I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki <br />but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading <br />Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th <br />time. ,<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />Adimai..Hippalas&#40;Yavanarani&#41; Moor samath&#40;Vijayamahadevi&#41;...Amir&#40;</div></blockquote>Kadal Pura)<br /><br />Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> <br />its <br />Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats <br />their <br />style. Now I <br />dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is <br />the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a <br />sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.<br />  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times <br />a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym></div></blockquote>more than the normal...<br /><br />What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the <br />individuals <br />concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it <br />and <br />later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I <br />feel. <br />(Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)<br /> <br /> <br />Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type <br />panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to <br />finish reading the <br />book. I dont <br />deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced <br />masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to <br />call for an epic status in thamil is <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Sandilyans work are more <br />masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the <br />will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will <br />be roaring success   <br />The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />  The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy <br />is not</div></blockquote>expecting...<br />This is too general a statement.

			<div class="content">The bombing of Rangoon touched me in a personal way. I have heard the story<br />from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office in<br />Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>raid sirens blew, and they all<br />ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get into<br />one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of his<br />chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and somehow, in<br />that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor ( a lady)<br />had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my grandfather<br />collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His family,<br />consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids (my mom wasn't born<br />then) of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to what<br />happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my grandmother<br />the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited the hospital and<br />eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by train to<br />Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that<br />enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He<br />mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through exhaustion<br />and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to<br />perish, according to him.<br /><br />There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles eventually<br />passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences">AIIMS</acronym> as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady doctor<br />who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her house<br />to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a doctor<br />because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.<br /><br />I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the right<br />side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used to<br />touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin tissue<br />between my finger and the whole.<br /><br />I have always wanted to write a story about this.

I have heard the story from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office in Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>raid sirens blew, and they all ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get into one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of his chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and somehow, in that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor ( a lady) had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my grandfather collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His family, consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids (my mom wasn't born then) of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to what happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my grandmother the use<br />of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited the hospital and eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by train to Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through exhaustion and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to perish, according to him.<br /><br />There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles eventually passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences">AIIMS</acronym> as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady doctor who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her house to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a doctor because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.<br /><br />I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the right side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used to touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin tissue between my finger and the whole.<br /><br />I have always wanted to write a story about this.
