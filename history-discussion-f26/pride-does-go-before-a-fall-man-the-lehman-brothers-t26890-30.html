			<div class="content">Hi Friends,<br /><br />There has been lot of changes in our country in the past 15 to 20 years.<br />For eg.,<br />* People who uses physical strength doesn't get much money<br />* Oneside people in IT Sector, Engg' sector, Real estate are making more<br />money<br /><br />On seeing this the farmers mind is seriously disturbed, I have seen many<br />farmers in Trichy and Thanjai areas sold their land (In main areas) to real<br />estate people and enjoying the money. On seeing those former farmers the<br />others also start thinking to sell their farming lands!! If this situation<br />continues it will spread to the interior villages slowly then what will<br />happen??<br /><br />So the first thing we need is best returns for the farmers, once the<br />Uzhavars get what they deserved only we can stop this conversion of farming<br />land to concrete jungle.<br /><br />You remember the uzhavar sandhai's, this was one of a good initiative but<br />unfortunately failed...<br /><br />Like shri said we need to market the products, but not for the individuals<br />something should be developed...<br /><br />Lets think..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R<br /><br />2008/9/18 Shriram Rajaram <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Venkatesh,<br /> <br />  Yes, at earlier stage it is difficult.

You probably know more about Europe but from my own experiences of dealing with Europeans for the past few years what you have declared is totally false.

			<div class="content">I have visited a 'self-pick' farm, near Birmingham, UK, several times.<br />You can pick vegetables - potatoes, beans, peas, cabbage and tomatoes,<br />fruits - apple, strawberry - eat as much as you want and pay only for<br />the produce picked. How much can one eat - 3 or 4 apples, 20-25<br />strawberries? and pay for about 5 kgs of each. The fellow at the till<br />does a rough weighing and grunts - 10 pounds.<br />It is a good day's outing; in fact the farm also sells cakes,<br />sandwitches, soft drinks and ice cremes, at (you guessed it) higher<br />prices. One has to drive 40 miles, 65 kms. to do all this. OK as a<br />picnic, not viable financially for the 'picker'.

			<div class="content">Hi Satheesh,<br />Â <br />Yes. you are right. Everybody must have some beauty sense. But in india, our ancestors and our ancient people had a verygood esthetic sense. (their buildings are evidences for this).<br />Â <br />Do everything in a tourism aspect. for example in the southern Belgium there is a place called Rochehaut (high rock). it is small village.. but they promote tourism like anything. <br />Here we dont need money. just some innovative thoughts. <br />Â <br />Shri<br /><br />--- El jue, 18/9/08, Satheesh kumar R  escribiÃ³: <br /><br />De: Satheesh kumar R <br />Asunto: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: pride does go before a fall - man the Lehman Brothers<br />Para: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Fecha: jueves, 18 septiembre, 2008 9:29<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Friends,<br /><br />There has been lot of changes in our country in the past 15 to 20 years.<br />For eg.,<br />* People who uses physical strength doesn't get much money<br />* Oneside people in IT Sector, Engg' sector, Real estate are making more money<br /><br />On seeing this the farmers mind is seriously disturbed, I have seen many farmers in Trichy and Thanjai areas sold their land (In main areas) to real estate people and enjoying the money. On seeing those former farmers the others also start thinking to sell their farming lands!! If this situation continues it will spread to the interior villages slowly then what will happen?? <br /><br />So the first thing we need is best returns for the farmers, once the Uzhavars get what they deserved only we can stop this conversion of farming land to concrete jungle.<br /><br />You remember the uzhavar sandhai's, this was one of a good initiative but unfortunately failed...<br /><br />Like shri said we need to market the products, but not for the individuals something should be developed...<br /><br />Lets think..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R<br /><br /><br />2008/9/18 Shriram Rajaram <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi Venkatesh,<br />Â <br />Yes, at earlier stage it is difficult. For example, in southern France, theNice (nees) beach was dirty like anything in the early 1900s. But now you see... it is one of the best beaches!<br />Â <br />We can start this idea with small groups. first for indians. then slowly people will be aware of this and we can educate them on this. <br />Â <br />Please dont mistake me...The Europeans know how to make money out of everything.but in a honest way!Â  But indians want money without work!

In india also i wish to<br />  see such things! <br />    Ã‚Â <br />    Please help me find people and let us join together to work it <br />out.<br />    Ã‚Â <br />    Shri<br />    <br />  <br />  Yes Shriram. you are right.<br />  <br />  In US too, I came across &#39;Strawberry Picking&#39;, &#39;Apple picking&#39; etc.<br />  Public are allowed in the field with baskets to pick strawberry or<br />  apple, without limits. and they have to pay for the weight of what<br />  they have picked. Much cheaper than the shop and we get fresh goods.<br />  The point is, they pick all the first quality stuff ahead of this, <br />and<br />  the remaining, which are sure to be wasted in transportation or not<br />  worth for sales &#40;like smaller in size and very ripe which might get<br />  damaged&#41; are allowed to the public. Both get benefited. Public get<br />  fresh product for a cheaper rate &#40;good stuff. Does a big or small<br />  strawberry matters as long as its fresh and tastes good?&#41; and the<br />  farmers avoid their wastage &#40;labour, damages, transportation etc&#41;. <br />And<br />  you can eat as much as you like in the field for free <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> . <br />  <br />  Indirect benefit - public will know what farming is and how it looks<br />  like. I was thinking why we dont do it in India. &#39;uzhavar sandhai&#39; <br />was<br />  a good concept, but practically failed &#40;even in US we have farmers<br />  market, once a week in some areas&#41;.<br />  <br />  The urban life has deprived the new generation from the knowledge of<br />  basics &#40;I heard that in US, many do not know how we get milk. <br />Because<br />  they just pick it from the shop. In wisconsin, there is an annual<br />  festival to show the public how cow is milked <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> &#41;.<br />  <br />  I think soon, India will need such things <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Arun: <br />As in most issues, both groups are right and both are wrong if selective<br />case studies are taken up for arguments.<br /><br />1. Gujarat has considerably incresed the yield of bio cotton, and is in<br />no. 1 position in India.<br />2. Many paddy growers have also reported increse in yield when the land<br />virtually made infertile with chemical fertilisers is exposed to organic<br />forming.<br />3. One 80 plus farmer in Gujarat, who was just eaking out a living with<br />his 10 acre land all his life, has seen income grow in geometric<br />proportion in the last 5 years; from a few thousand to about 10 crores.<br />As he paid full tax, income tax officials visited his farm in the last<br />two years to check. He switched to intensive farming of potatoes with<br />the help of Mc Donald, and his total produce is bought by Mc Donald.<br /><br />There are many such success stories and sob stories.
