Pitaji heard Gandhi utter the <br />  words, "Hai ram [Oh God] ... Hai ram ... Hai Ram" as he hit the <br />  ground. <br />  <br />  Instead of attacking Godse, Pitaji, along with Gandhi&#39;s nieces <br />Manu <br />  and Abha, picked up Gandhi&#39;s body and rushed him to nearby Birla <br />  house. Pitaji carried Gandhi by the head. <br />  <br />  It was there that Gandhi was pronounced dead<br />  <br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html">http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/ ... godse.html</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  TIME: But surely it takes more than good publicity to create a <br />  Gandhi? <br />  Godse: There is another thing. Generally in the Indian masses, <br />  people are attracted toward saintism. Gandhi was shrewd to use his <br />  saintdom for politics. After his death the government used him. <br />The <br />  government knew that he was an enemy of Hindus, but they wanted to <br />  show that he was a staunch Hindu. So the first act they did was to <br />  put "Hey Ram" into Gandhi&#39;s dead mouth. <br />  <br />  TIME: You mean that he did not say "Hey Ram" as he died? <br />  Godse: No, he did not say it. You see, it was an automatic pistol. <br />  It had a magazine for nine bullets but there were actually seven <br />at <br />  that time. And once you pull the trigger, within a second, all the <br />  seven bullets had passed. When these bullets pass through crucial <br />  points like the heart, consciousness is finished. You have no <br />  strength. <br />  <br />  When Nathuram saw Gandhi was coming, he took out the pistol and <br />  folded his hands with the pistol inside it. There was one girl <br />very <br />  close to Gandhi. He feared that he would hurt the girl. So he went <br />  forward and with his left hand pushed her aside and shot. It <br />  happened within one second. You see, there was a film and some <br />  Kingsley fellow had acted as Gandhi. Someone asked me whether <br />Gandhi <br />  said, "Hey Ram." I said Kingsley did say it. But Gandhi did not. <br />  Because that was not a drama. <br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  The next moment I fired at Gandhi. Gandhi was very weak, there was <br />a <br />  feeble sound like &#39;aah&#39; from him and he fell down. <br />  <br />  Those who were close to me saw the weapon in my hand. They rushed <br />  away from the spot. Gandhi had fallen to the ground, I was <br />standing <br />  and the crowd had formed a ring around us.</div></blockquote></div>

Pitaji carried Gandhi by the head. <br />    <br />    It was there that Gandhi was pronounced dead<br />    <br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html">http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/ ... godse.html</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    TIME: But surely it takes more than good publicity to create a <br />    Gandhi? <br />    Godse: There is another thing. Generally in the Indian masses, <br />    people are attracted toward saintism. Gandhi was shrewd to use <br />his <br />    saintdom for politics. After his death the government used him. <br />  The <br />    government knew that he was an enemy of Hindus, but they wanted <br />to <br />    show that he was a staunch Hindu. So the first act they did was <br />to <br />    put "Hey Ram" into Gandhi&#39;s dead mouth. <br />    <br />    TIME: You mean that he did not say "Hey Ram" as he died? <br />    Godse: No, he did not say it. You see, it was an automatic <br />pistol. <br />    It had a magazine for nine bullets but there were actually seven <br />  at <br />    that time. And once you pull the trigger, within a second, all <br />the <br />    seven bullets had passed. When these bullets pass through <br />crucial <br />    points like the heart, consciousness is finished. You have no <br />    strength. <br />    <br />    When Nathuram saw Gandhi was coming, he took out the pistol and <br />    folded his hands with the pistol inside it. There was one girl <br />  very <br />    close to Gandhi. He feared that he would hurt the girl. So he <br />went <br />    forward and with his left hand pushed her aside and shot. It <br />    happened within one second. You see, there was a film and some <br />    Kingsley fellow had acted as Gandhi. Someone asked me whether <br />  Gandhi <br />    said, "Hey Ram." I said Kingsley did say it. But Gandhi did not. <br />    Because that was not a drama. <br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    The next moment I fired at Gandhi. Gandhi was very weak, there <br />was <br />  a <br />    feeble sound like &#39;aah&#39; from him and he fell down. <br />    <br />    Those who were close to me saw the weapon in my hand. They <br />rushed <br />    away from the spot. Gandhi had fallen to the ground, I was <br />  standing <br />    and the crowd had formed a ring around us.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Venkat<br /><br />Gandhi as a freedom fighter - a national leader for the freedom movement was the greatest we can ever imagine.<br />Gandhi as a personal man - i reserve my comments, i feel unethical to comment on that. What his sons say are their views.<br />Gandhi as a spiritual (not religious) - he was highly evolved, selfish may be, but very highly evolved.<br />Gandhi as a politician or cross religion patron - he was not convincing, he was trying to force the hindu dharma from Gita to the moslem world, it would not work.<br /><br />Ghodse does not say - I know Gandhi said ahh...i heard him loud n clear. Hey Ram or Rama Rama etc... how the hell did it come from ? Anti Gandhians can always support Ghodse for his words. Come what may, what Ghodse thought as a reason is different, but he IS a murderer and a murderer of the nations greatest freedom fighter. There ends the story.<br />Hey Ram or Rama or Ram Ram what ever be it... it has the sound of Rama in many versions... in a weak man's tome ghodse standing 1 meter away and his mind ringing on murder the odds of him hearing rama in a feeble tone can be sounding as aah.<br /><br />Gandhi was against hindu's ? I would object to that, Gandhi's biggest mistake was trying to provincialize hindu model of life everywhere, it wont work. Only a true hindu can decipher and write about the bagavat gita.<br />There are aethists, there are non hindu's. There is nothing wrong in being either, its one's choice, to try to bridge-in was the difficult thing, for a evolved person. Again, I am not saying Gandhi is a saint. There were great saints such as Sai Baba or Shiridi or Kabir who tried this unity - did it work ? It wont atleast for the long haul. It never has, but that does not mean hindu and moslem and christians cannot co exsist. We all can and we all will.<br /><br />I dont think I can believe the one man version of 'ahh' vs many versions of Rama (hey ram, rama, ram ram etc). In today's world, for a human, unless Rama or Muruga owes him money, its difficult to produce that name at the very end.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Monday, November 26, 2007 6:58:43 AM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: gandhi's mode of action<br /><br />Venkat,<br /><br />I think, all these mails written were to highlight only one aspect,<br />dont look at things only in one sided, please see the other side as<br />well.

I dont <br />think you cannot divorce a public and private life of a person who is <br />the father of a nation.<br /><br />on gandhi's personal life, he himself tried to be an open book and <br />beleived that "caesars wife should be above suspicion"<br />but this dark secret of him, his obsession with a married woman who <br />he be wanted to be the guiding spirit of the freedom movement.<br />eople have a right to know and right to discuss. you just cant wish <br />it away.<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venkat<br />  <br />  Gandhi as a freedom fighter - a national leader for the freedom <br />movement was the greatest we can ever imagine. <br />  Gandhi as a personal man - i reserve my comments, i feel unethical <br />to comment on that.

			<div class="content">The thiruvilayadal line of dharumi comes to mind... paatezuthi peyar vaangum pulavar...one <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />This is what I said: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Gandhi as a personal man - i reserve my comments, i feel unethical<br />to comment on that. What his sons say are their views.</div></blockquote>-- Did I mention that you should not speak on him? you can speak on any one my friend, as a person who speaks so much for dharma, i would never object to what you say... The same winston churchil whom you applauded was a drunkard and womanizer, I did not hold that against him, I never will. I dont care...but thats me and a few like me may approve that.<br />epporul yar yar vai ketpin apporul meipporul kaanbathu arivu, lets just say that your words or theories would never deter me but make me more curious to delve into a lot of things to strengthen my belief.<br /><br />If gandhi's obsession with a married woman helped us get our freedom, does it bother you? It does not to me <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />I will again say he was spiritually very evolved, I had earlier mentioned on sexual energy conversion to talent (it was in the thread on child mairrage). I may have a theory...some who know of spiritual progress may attest...Gandhi's evolvement into karma and other areas of spiritual tones may have caused his motivation levels to lead the nation go down, he probably made a pact with karma to mentally use an obsession to build himself up. Though I feel it may not make sense to you, I am compelled to talk this way. An obsession is mental and can produce enough energy and motivation to run around. Sometimes we get motivated listening to Rajini or MGR songs, some people get motivated seeing Kushboo or Simran... honestly does it matter ? How gandhi got rid of the obsession is what makes him different from us. Your defenition of my theory may be termed as 'odd' and something is wrong...but there is a possiblity, someday when I meet him in heaven may be he will<br />disclose to me <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />There are two types of people my friend, the people type who follow Ramayanam and the people who follow iravana kaviyam... the people who say Jesus was a Saint and God send ...and the people who think he was a joke... the people who say Gandhi was a great man...so on and so forth. Intha charecters ellam vaznthalum eesum vazhalanaalum eesum...vaiyagam ithu thaan <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As long as the world spins, the balance is natural. I accept that law of nature. However, I personally may read iravana kaviyam to only, in gandhian model, to test my faith.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: R.venketesh <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Monday, November 26, 2007 10:50:55 AM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: gandhi's mode of action<br /><br />hi<br /><br />gandhis last moments were described by the people standing closest to<br />him in the most differing ways.<br />not assumptions based on godse's version.<br />what i am saying is based on a full scale research for a set of books<br />we are planning on gandhi.<br />we are having a book on the salt march by a eminent writer who re<br />enacted the entire march at the age of 70.<br />muruganandam ofcourse has started his work on the godse trial. we<br />hope the book will be explanatory to many who dont know much about<br />those two three years.<br />I think we will do a book on these private life aspects too.
