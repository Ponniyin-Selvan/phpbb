			<div class="content">Let us do digitization, indexing and reading of 100<br />palm leaf books from our group. It is a task we can<br />chew...<br /><br />Any buyers of this idea?<br /><br />--- S Sampath <br />wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Links given below will give some information on the<br />  National Mission for<br />  Manuscripts. There was a flurry of activity in<br />  2003/04, and manuscripts<br />  numbering in laks from Karnataka, Gujarat &#40;maximum&#41;<br />  and other states<br />  were identified from individuals for digitization.<br />  But now, there is not<br />  much news about its activities. Even the web sites<br />  are not updated. The<br />  most recent news I have seen, &#40;last week&#41;, the<br />  National Centre for<br />  Performing Arts, the body entrusted with the<br />  project, froze distribution<br />  of funds to the manuscript mission, citing mal<br />  practices in withdrawal<br />  and spending. Let that be.<br /> <br />  In the early days, there was tremendous response,<br />  and teams visited a<br />  large number of villages/towns and collected<br />  manuscripts from<br />  individuals for digitization. They were overwhelmed<br />  by the quantity of<br />  manuscripts available, all over India. The momentum<br />  slackened and there<br />  was no publicity after some time. Not sure, how the<br />  manuscripts<br />  collected and digitized will be made available with<br />  proper indexing and<br />  search facility. I doubt whether the mission can<br />  mange this, with its<br />  inertia, availability of domain specific experts and<br />  facilities.<br /> <br />  My only sore issue is: our inability to have the<br />  evidence in a decoded<br />  printed format in our hands, is no justification to<br />  question our<br />  forefather&#39;s lack of historical sense and make fun<br />  of them. People like<br />  Madan who reach a wider reading public, must be<br />  sensitive about this.<br /> <br />  Unless the documents are available to a large group<br />  of committed and<br />  devout researchers for study and deciphering, what<br />  ever is collected may<br />  also be lost. Only IT savvy youngsters like in this<br />  group, can find a<br />  solution for this &#39;himalayan&#39; problem.<br />  Sampath<br /> <br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/">http://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/</a><!-- m --><br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://namami.nic.in/mission.htm">http://namami.nic.in/mission.htm</a><!-- m --><br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar<br />  Arunachalam"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    VK and others,<br />   <br />    There is every possibility that there can be<br />  valuable resources<br />    hidden in some private collection, but practically<br />  speaking its<br />    impossible.<br />   <br />    From: my understanding, its very difficult to<br />  preserve palm leaf,<br />    without proper maintenance, it will crumble to<br />  pieces in a few<br />    years.

			<div class="content">When Europeans base their history on literature, thats hailed and we <br />say we should learn from them. But Sri, there are so many Indians <br />who say that Mahabaratha and Ramayana are just literature and cannot <br />be treated as History. Strong belivers of Hindus will realise that <br />they are not mere fiction but history indeed.<br /><br />Lots and lots of stories are spread across the vedas, which are <br />brushed aside as pure fiction by many pagutharivalars. Even some <br />three years back, we had a heated argument in our group regarding <br />vedas and many of the vedic beliefs were criticised as being pro-<br />brahminical. Same lack of evidences were pointed out then, to subdue <br />the supremacy of vedas.<br /><br />So where we stand? are we behaving like politicians who bend the <br />rules based on the benefits?<br /><br />I am not a regular follower of Madan's qa sessions, but whatever I <br />have read, even for the simplest of the answers a lot of research <br />has been done. When such a learned person says something, we cannot <br />brush aside them just like that.<br /><br />I accept that we do have information in bits and pices. Many have <br />been destroyed by rivalry, either pandya invasion or muslim <br />invasion. My point is when Indians or the historians turn blind to <br />accept many of the facets of Indian Hisotory/Hinduism (eg. to accept <br />the aryan invasion theory as myth, because if accepted, Hinduism <br />become native to India), will the same Indians or historians accept <br />the literature or our commitment to show our supremacy? <br /><br />We cant have double standard you see.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, sridhar rathinam <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear all<br />  have really been very busy last few weeks<br />  there are just a few points I thought ill raise<br />  <br />  1.Lack of evidence doesnt mean the theory is wrong before <br />dismissing it....<br />  2. there is evidence agreed its in bits and pieces.....heard of <br />something called TROY???<br />  the whole history is based on Homer&#39;s writing....there are tourist <br />spots in turkey which claim that was troy...there is an alternate</div></blockquote>group which claim Britain was troy and the whole war was for <br />Tin..yes the metal but thats regardedas part of history<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Heard of King Authur the Brits celebrate his legend as <br />history....I dont think all that bits about the Vikings and Saxons</div></blockquote>but they are proud of it and have written volumes of what is <br />available.....<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>We lack that commitment and we constantly criticise the ones who <br />do it...<br />  I heard somebody say...<br />  &#39;&#39;success is when you built a castle out the stones thrown at you&#39;&#39;<br />  I think thats where we are unique and are trying to do something <br />great HATS OFF and GOOD LUCK<br />  Regards<br />  Sri<br />  NATARAJAN SRINIVASAN  <br />wrote: Venkatesh,<br />   <br />  Listing the challenges in a pesimistic way, is it not<br />  Madan&#39;s way?</div></blockquote></div>
