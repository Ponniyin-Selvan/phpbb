			<div class="content">There are extensive references to this in the 'Koil Olugu'.<br />I remember reading Sujatha expressing doubts on the '12000' number <br />for reasons I dont remember now. <br /><br />Koil Olugu also goes into detail on the travels of the urchavar (I <br />believe called 'Azhagiya manavalar') during the 60 years of exile in <br />Tirupati and other temples. There is also a theory that the idol <br />brought back to Srirangam was a replica of the original and original <br />one is still hidden in a temple unknown to others.<br /><br />You know, when I saw that still of Kamal with the idol of Azhagiya <br />Manavalar in 'Dasavatharam', I took interest and when I heard that <br />Kamal is also playing a 12th century vaishnavite in the movie, I <br />realized and am pretty sure that it is the story of 'Azhagiya <br />Manavalar's travels during the sack of Sri Rangam. Most probably, <br />Sujatha put him upto it...<br /><br />I am all excited and waiting to see the movie..<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Now let us slightly go back to POST GAZNI - or Malik Gafur in <br />    Southern India &#40;say 1350 AD&#41; Just prior to Vijayanagara &#40;in <br />about <br />    1500 AD&#41;!<br />    <br />    From about 1320 AD - Tamilnadu confronted with the following: <br />    <br />  <br />  Dear sps<br />  <br />  Just today i was seeing this reference...talk of <br />  coincidences.....also venkat your madurai - when is it going to <br />come <br />  out in tamil...<br />  <br />  1311C.E.- Attacks by Malik Kafur, the general of Allauddin Khilji: <br />  <br />  According the traditional accounts, the Muslim army lead by Malik <br />  Kafur entered the Srirangam temple throught the northern gateway <br />of <br />  the 3rd enclosure. The resistance of the Brahmins was overcome <br />  easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and <br />numerous <br />  icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray however <br />did <br />  not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all the <br />  treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The temple <br />  rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.<br />  <br />  1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam <br />temple: <br />  <br />  Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest son <br />  Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in 1321 <br />C.E. <br />  When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />  temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of which the <br />  procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby shrine. <br />The <br />  gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and the <br />  festival was continued. When the invaders reached Samayapuram, <br />  Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the temple, <br />  decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />  ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away the <br />  procession image of the deity in the southern direction secretly, <br />  with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, he <br />  dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few boxes <br />  of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the <br />doors <br />  of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines of <br />both <br />  Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images <br />outside <br />  and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />  desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, including <br />the <br />  great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri Vedanta <br />  Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the sole <br />  manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri <br />Sudarsana, <br />  and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, they <br />  fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika <br />published <br />  the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally housed <br />in <br />  the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after Pillai <br />  Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his kith <br />  and kin at Srirangam.<br />  <br />  The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an end <br />to <br />  Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the invading <br />  general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple altogether, <br />  and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few cornices. <br />The <br />  Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />  rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the occupying <br />  Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked by <br />  disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved to <br />the <br />  nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />  fortress at its place. <br />  <br />  The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the <br />mention <br />  of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />  harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the Muslim <br />  chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the pretext <br />of <br />  showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and <br />killed <br />  him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a result <br />of <br />  her deed, she threw herself also down. According to tradition, to <br />  honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are lit <br />by <br />  fire brought from the temple kitchen.<br />  <br />  In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar <br />wrested <br />  back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon <br />hidden <br />  at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.<br />  <br />  1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French: <br />  <br />  During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of the <br />  French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the temple, and <br />  were planning on harassing the entire population that had taken <br />  refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy on <br />  behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist of the <br />  harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the occupying <br />  troops, including the molestation of women. The inner precincts of <br />  the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers of <br />  the army of Chanda Saheb. <br />  <br />  1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali: <br />  <br />  Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded Srirangam <br />in <br />  1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />  region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />  whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />  However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the disaster.<br />  <br />  1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan: <br />  <br />  Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 C.E. <br />with <br />  his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. He <br />  stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded 100000 <br />  gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The demand <br />was <br />  refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, <br />Tippu <br />  had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his vengeance <br />  upon the temple.<br />  <br />  ________________________<br />  <br />  The instance below took place during the &#39;Carnatic Wars&#39; &#40;1743-<br />1763&#41; <br />  fought between the British and the French for the control of South <br />  India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along these <br />two <br />  European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and the <br />  Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with the <br />  French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab of <br />  Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />  Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi &#40;1732-36&#41; of <br />  the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the <br />indignities <br />  heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb&#39;s men, the queen took poison and <br />  died in 1736. During his rule &#40;1736-1740&#41;, Chanda Saheb harassed <br />the <br />  temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money from <br />  them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading Maratha <br />  forces in 1740.<br />  <br />  "Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga Pillai, <br />  the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix &#40; = the French <br />  Commander&#41;, states; &#39;Today I heard the following news. Of the <br />troops <br />  at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 troopers <br />have <br />  received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money to <br />  live on and have suffered much from the enemy&#39;s &#40;= the British&#41; <br />  blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam temple <br />just <br />  as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple people <br />  saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the grain <br />  stored there." &#40;pg. 212&#41;<br />  <br />  When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />  Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who worked <br />for <br />  Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple and <br />  ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, the <br />  British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.<br />  <br />  Reference: <br />  V. N.

The resistance of the Brahmins was overcome <br />    easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and <br />  numerous <br />    icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray however <br />  did <br />    not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all the <br />    treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The <br />temple <br />    rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.<br />    <br />    1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam <br />  temple: <br />    <br />    Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest son <br />    Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in 1321 <br />  C.E. <br />    When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />    temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of which <br />the <br />    procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby shrine. <br />  The <br />    gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and the <br />    festival was continued. When the invaders reached Samayapuram, <br />    Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the temple, <br />    decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />    ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away the <br />    procession image of the deity in the southern direction secretly, <br />    with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, he <br />    dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few <br />boxes <br />    of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the <br />  doors <br />    of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines of <br />  both <br />    Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images <br />  outside <br />    and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />    desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, including <br />  the <br />    great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri Vedanta <br />    Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the sole <br />    manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri <br />  Sudarsana, <br />    and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, they <br />    fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika <br />  published <br />    the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally housed <br />  in <br />    the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after Pillai <br />    Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his <br />kith <br />    and kin at Srirangam.<br />    <br />    The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an end <br />  to <br />    Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the invading <br />    general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple altogether, <br />    and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few cornices. <br />  The <br />    Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />    rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the occupying <br />    Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked by <br />    disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved to <br />  the <br />    nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />    fortress at its place. <br />    <br />    The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the <br />  mention <br />    of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />    harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the Muslim <br />    chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the pretext <br />  of <br />    showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and <br />  killed <br />    him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a result <br />  of <br />    her deed, she threw herself also down. According to tradition, to <br />    honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are lit <br />  by <br />    fire brought from the temple kitchen.<br />    <br />    In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar <br />  wrested <br />    back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon <br />  hidden <br />    at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.<br />    <br />    1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French: <br />    <br />    During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of the <br />    French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the temple, <br />and <br />    were planning on harassing the entire population that had taken <br />    refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy on <br />    behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist of the <br />    harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the <br />occupying <br />    troops, including the molestation of women. The inner precincts <br />of <br />    the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers of <br />    the army of Chanda Saheb. <br />    <br />    1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali: <br />    <br />    Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded Srirangam <br />  in <br />    1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />    region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />    whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />    However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the disaster.<br />    <br />    1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan: <br />    <br />    Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 C.E. <br />  with <br />    his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. He <br />    stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded 100000 <br />    gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The demand <br />  was <br />    refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, <br />  Tippu <br />    had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his <br />vengeance <br />    upon the temple.<br />    <br />    ________________________<br />    <br />    The instance below took place during the &#39;Carnatic Wars&#39; &#40;1743-<br />  1763&#41; <br />    fought between the British and the French for the control of <br />South <br />    India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along these <br />  two <br />    European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and the <br />    Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with <br />the <br />    French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab of <br />    Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />    Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi &#40;1732-36&#41; <br />of <br />    the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the <br />  indignities <br />    heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb&#39;s men, the queen took poison and <br />    died in 1736. During his rule &#40;1736-1740&#41;, Chanda Saheb harassed <br />  the <br />    temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money <br />from <br />    them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading Maratha <br />    forces in 1740.<br />    <br />    "Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga <br />Pillai, <br />    the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix &#40; = the French <br />    Commander&#41;, states; &#39;Today I heard the following news. Of the <br />  troops <br />    at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 troopers <br />  have <br />    received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money to <br />    live on and have suffered much from the enemy&#39;s &#40;= the British&#41; <br />    blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam temple <br />  just <br />    as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple people <br />    saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the grain <br />    stored there." &#40;pg. 212&#41;<br />    <br />    When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />    Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who worked <br />  for <br />    Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple <br />and <br />    ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, the <br />    British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.<br />    <br />    Reference: <br />    V. N.

			<div class="content">vanakkam,<br /><br />Malik Kafur's attack on Srirangam, the valiant attempt by the priests,<br />the urchavar's journey, the idol being kept in Tirupathi and later in<br />Melkote, Veera Ballala's attempt to revive Hinduism, his tragic ending<br />in the Kannanur(Samayapuram) war, Kumara Kampanna's defeat of the<br />muslims and finally the urchavar's return to Srirangam are all covered<br />in the books 'Thiruvarangan Ula' and 'Madura Vijayam' by Sri<br />Venugopalan(aka Pushpa Thangadurai).<br /><br />The novel says that when the temple finally re-opened there were two<br />sets of idols brought to the temple and both are being worshipped.<br /><br />Even today one can find the Ranga Mandapam in Tirupathi. A notice board<br />says that the Srirangam deity was housed there for sometime during the<br />Muslim invasion.<br /><br />swetha</div>

The inner <br />precincts <br />  of <br />      the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers <br />of <br />      the army of Chanda Saheb. <br />      <br />      1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali: <br />      <br />      Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded <br />Srirangam <br />    in <br />      1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />      region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />      whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />      However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the <br />disaster.<br />      <br />      1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan: <br />      <br />      Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 <br />C.E. <br />    with <br />      his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. <br />He <br />      stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded <br />100000 <br />      gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The <br />demand <br />    was <br />      refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, <br />    Tippu <br />      had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his <br />  vengeance <br />      upon the temple.<br />      <br />      ________________________<br />      <br />      The instance below took place during the &#39;Carnatic Wars&#39; &#40;1743-<br />    1763&#41; <br />      fought between the British and the French for the control of <br />  South <br />      India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along <br />these <br />    two <br />      European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and <br />the <br />      Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with <br />  the <br />      French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab <br />of <br />      Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />      Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi &#40;1732-<br />36&#41; <br />  of <br />      the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the <br />    indignities <br />      heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb&#39;s men, the queen took poison <br />and <br />      died in 1736. During his rule &#40;1736-1740&#41;, Chanda Saheb <br />harassed <br />    the <br />      temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money <br />  from <br />      them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading <br />Maratha <br />      forces in 1740.<br />      <br />      "Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga <br />  Pillai, <br />      the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix &#40; = the French <br />      Commander&#41;, states; &#39;Today I heard the following news. Of the <br />    troops <br />      at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 <br />troopers <br />    have <br />      received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money <br />to <br />      live on and have suffered much from the enemy&#39;s &#40;= the <br />British&#41; <br />      blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam <br />temple <br />    just <br />      as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple <br />people <br />      saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the <br />grain <br />      stored there." &#40;pg. 212&#41;<br />      <br />      When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />      Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who <br />worked <br />    for <br />      Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple <br />  and <br />      ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, <br />the <br />      British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.<br />      <br />      Reference: <br />      V. N.

The resistance of the Brahmins was <br />overcome <br />        easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and <br />      numerous <br />        icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray <br />  however <br />      did <br />        not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all <br />the <br />        treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The <br />    temple <br />        rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.<br />        <br />        1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam <br />      temple: <br />        <br />        Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest <br />  son <br />        Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in <br />1321 <br />      C.E. <br />        When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />        temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of <br />which <br />    the <br />        procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby <br />  shrine. <br />      The <br />        gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and <br />  the <br />        festival was continued. When the invaders reached <br />Samayapuram, <br />        Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the <br />  temple, <br />        decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />        ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away <br />  the <br />        procession image of the deity in the southern direction <br />  secretly, <br />        with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, <br />  he <br />        dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few <br />    boxes <br />        of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the <br />      doors <br />        of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines <br />  of <br />      both <br />        Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images <br />      outside <br />        and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />        desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, <br />  including <br />      the <br />        great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri <br />Vedanta <br />        Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the <br />sole <br />        manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri <br />      Sudarsana, <br />        and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, <br />  they <br />        fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika <br />      published <br />        the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally <br />  housed <br />      in <br />        the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after <br />  Pillai <br />        Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his <br />    kith <br />        and kin at Srirangam.<br />        <br />        The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an <br />  end <br />      to <br />        Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the <br />invading <br />        general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple <br />  altogether, <br />        and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few <br />  cornices. <br />      The <br />        Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />        rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the <br />  occupying <br />        Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked <br />  by <br />        disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved <br />  to <br />      the <br />        nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />        fortress at its place. <br />        <br />        The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the <br />      mention <br />        of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />        harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the <br />  Muslim <br />        chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the <br />  pretext <br />      of <br />        showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and <br />      killed <br />        him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a <br />  result <br />      of <br />        her deed, she threw herself also down. According to <br />tradition, <br />  to <br />        honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are <br />  lit <br />      by <br />        fire brought from the temple kitchen.<br />        <br />        In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar <br />      wrested <br />        back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon <br />      hidden <br />        at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.<br />        <br />        1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French: <br />        <br />        During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of <br />  the <br />        French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the <br />temple, <br />    and <br />        were planning on harassing the entire population that had <br />  taken <br />        refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy <br />  on <br />        behalf of the local inhabitants.

The resistance of the Brahmins was <br />  overcome <br />          easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and <br />        numerous <br />          icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray <br />    however <br />        did <br />          not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all <br />  the <br />          treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. <br />The <br />      temple <br />          rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.<br />          <br />          1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of <br />Srirangam <br />        temple: <br />          <br />          Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his <br />eldest <br />    son <br />          Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in <br />  1321 <br />        C.E. <br />          When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the <br />Srirangam <br />          temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of <br />  which <br />      the <br />          procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby <br />    shrine. <br />        The <br />          gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was <br />and <br />    the <br />          festival was continued. When the invaders reached <br />  Samayapuram, <br />          Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the <br />    temple, <br />          decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the <br />12000 <br />          ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent <br />away <br />    the <br />          procession image of the deity in the southern direction <br />    secretly, <br />          with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. <br />Then, <br />    he <br />          dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a <br />few <br />      boxes <br />          of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked <br />the <br />        doors <br />          of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the <br />shrines <br />    of <br />        both <br />          Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo <br />images <br />        outside <br />          and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading <br />army <br />          desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, <br />    including <br />        the <br />          great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri <br />  Vedanta <br />          Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the <br />  sole <br />          manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri <br />        Sudarsana, <br />          and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was <br />over, <br />    they <br />          fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika <br />        published <br />          the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally <br />    housed <br />        in <br />          the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after <br />    Pillai <br />          Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of <br />his <br />      kith <br />          and kin at Srirangam.<br />          <br />          The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and <br />an <br />    end <br />        to <br />          Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the <br />  invading <br />          general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple <br />    altogether, <br />          and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few <br />    cornices. <br />        The <br />          Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the <br />sacred <br />          rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the <br />    occupying <br />          Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly <br />attacked <br />    by <br />          disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he <br />moved <br />    to <br />        the <br />          nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected <br />a <br />          fortress at its place. <br />          <br />          The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without <br />the <br />        mention <br />          of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear <br />the <br />          harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the <br />    Muslim <br />          chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the <br />    pretext <br />        of <br />          showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down <br />and <br />        killed <br />          him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a <br />    result <br />        of <br />          her deed, she threw herself also down. According to <br />  tradition, <br />    to <br />          honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans <br />are <br />    lit <br />        by <br />          fire brought from the temple kitchen.<br />          <br />          In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of <br />Vijayanagar <br />        wrested <br />          back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the <br />icon <br />        hidden <br />          at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.<br />          <br />          1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French: <br />          <br />          During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation <br />of <br />    the <br />          French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the <br />  temple, <br />      and <br />          were planning on harassing the entire population that had <br />    taken <br />          refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for <br />mercy <br />    on <br />          behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist <br />of <br />    the <br />          harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the <br />      occupying <br />          troops, including the molestation of women. The inner <br />    precincts <br />      of <br />          the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput <br />  soldiers <br />    of <br />          the army of Chanda Saheb. <br />          <br />          1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali: <br />          <br />          Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded <br />    Srirangam <br />        in <br />          1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of <br />  the <br />          region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves <br />in, <br />          whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple <br />  altogether. <br />          However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the <br />    disaster.<br />          <br />          1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan: <br />          <br />          Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 <br />    C.E. <br />        with <br />          his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and <br />destruction. <br />    He <br />          stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded <br />    100000 <br />          gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The <br />    demand <br />        was <br />          refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately <br />  however, <br />        Tippu <br />          had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his <br />      vengeance <br />          upon the temple.<br />          <br />          ________________________<br />          <br />          The instance below took place during the &#39;Carnatic <br />  Wars&#39; &#40;1743-<br />        1763&#41; <br />          fought between the British and the French for the control <br />of <br />      South <br />          India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along <br />    these <br />        two <br />          European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam <br />and <br />    the <br />          Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied <br />  with <br />      the <br />          French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the <br />  Nawab <br />    of <br />          Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />          Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi <br />&#40;1732-<br />    36&#41; <br />      of <br />          the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the <br />        indignities <br />          heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb&#39;s men, the queen took <br />poison <br />    and <br />          died in 1736. During his rule &#40;1736-1740&#41;, Chanda Saheb <br />    harassed <br />        the <br />          temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of <br />money <br />      from <br />          them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading <br />    Maratha <br />          forces in 1740.<br />          <br />          "Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga <br />      Pillai, <br />          the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix &#40; = the <br />French <br />          Commander&#41;, states; &#39;Today I heard the following news.
