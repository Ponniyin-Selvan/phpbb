In this article, the <br />details of inscriptions have been gone into.. and finally ending <br />saying nothing in the inscription is related to Pallippadai ..<br /><br />The details are like this:<br /> <br />There was a Sivapathasekara Mangalam.. <br /> <br />(Is it udayalur or nearby is yet to be idetified). In present day<br />Udayalur, there are about 3 temples. 1. Siva Temple. 2. Perumal<br />(Vinnagaram). 3. Paalkulathamman koil (on the banks of a village <br />tank. (In the entrance pillar exists the inscription - which is <br />almost half cemented - thanks to lack of concern to our History).<br /><br />Kudanthai Sethuraman ( of Raman & Raman bus Service - mega<br />Industrialist) published a series of articles way back in 70 - which<br />included an article that this was related to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s samadhi;<br /> <br />(Now retired) Principal of Thiruvaiyaru Arts College - Dr. <br />Thangamani has supported this view (as Published in Vikadan Diwali <br />Malar - reported in the Gp earlier).<br /><br />Kudavoil Dr. Balu (of Saraswathi Mahal Library Thanjavur / now<br />retired) claims that the detrails are 90% true (as reported in the<br />Junior Vikadan current issue..) but not 100% ..<br /> <br />What is NOT reported widely is THAT THESE INSCRIPTIONS are FOUND  <br />by the British Archeologists as early in 1927-28 and Published in <br />the Annual Report of Epigraphy (ARE) under the heading "Samadhi <br />Temples " and " Pallipadais"<br /><br />Sethuraman quoted apart from this inscription, other inscriptions <br />also :<br /> <br />1. Easana Siva Pandithar (who was the chief Priest of the Big <br />Temple ) was incharge of Sivapathasekaramangalam temple !<br /><br />2. They were practicing Mahavradham and known as Mahavradhis. Which<br />is known as Paasupatha - Laguleesam and this sect normally maintains<br />Pallippadais and they did maintain the Pallippadai of Panchavan <br />Madevi - which is located about 3 KMs West of this temple !<br /><br />3. The dilapidated Mandap (Mundril) was renovated - after the<br />renovator OBSERVED VRADHAMs ! - after about 100 years ! (There is <br />an instance where another Dilapidated Siva temple nearby was <br />renovated, but the renovator DID NOT perform Vradham ).<br /><br />4. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> - atleast after making <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> as Heir - apparent in 1012 AD <br />(both co-ruled for 3 years) - appeared to have become Godly person <br />(Pls go through Archives - Godification of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>) - assumed the name<br />Sivapathasekaran and his idols were kept and worshipped in the Big<br />Temple even when he was alive and several other temples including<br />Papanasam - after he passed away.<br /> <br />5. Easana Siva Pandithar has installed his OWN IDOL in the big <br />temple - when he was alive ! and several grants were accorded!<br />Means he was kept in very high esteem by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as well as <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>!<br /> <br />Summarising ..<br /> <br />The line of thinking that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was Godified and his mortals were<br />accorded Godly status is not out of place ..<br /> <br />Whether Udayalur is the Venue is to be decided beyond traces of <br />doubt ..<br /> <br />Time will reveal this .. <br /><br />regards/ sps</div>
