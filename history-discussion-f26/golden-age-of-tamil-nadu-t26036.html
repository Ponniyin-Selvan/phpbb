			<div class="content">Dear SPS,&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In a recent post, you have said that the ruling period of&nbsp;Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra (985 CE to 1044) was said to be a golden period.<br />&nbsp;<br />In general&nbsp;to define a&nbsp;golden period, what are the credential needed? The Gupta's period during Chandragupta-1 - Samudhra Gupta - &amp; Vikramathiya, was already mentioned in history books of India as 'Golden&nbsp;Age of India'. So many sanscritic classics works were born during that period including Kalidasa.<br />&nbsp;<br />Rajaraja's rule was remarkably well during that period&nbsp;except some warring times.&nbsp;The wars also were won, and the people said to be living in happy,&nbsp;so that the King was having&nbsp;enough&nbsp; time in spending his concentration on Big Temple and other connected works, apart from the other administrative handlings. The period was generally calm. The Kingbrought out a democratic ruling culture in village level. The able administration was another crediteria so that to keep federal cheif's&nbsp;under the King's control. Most importantly nature also&nbsp; have co-operated so that not many calamities.<br />&nbsp;<br />But this situation was extended till Kulottungan-2 and even his son thatwas upto 1185 CE.<br />So can we say the years of 985 to 1185 CE or upto 1200 CE&nbsp;was the Golden Age of <br />Tamilnadu? Like north India, the tamil classical works like collections of Nambi-andar-Nambi,&nbsp;Periyapuranam, Kalingattu Parani and Kambaramayanam were born in those periods. Scores of Temples were built and art works displayed all over the state. Except some small&nbsp;times during Vikraman ruling there were not much natural calamities. Almost wars ended&nbsp;with Northern neighbores.<br />&nbsp;<br />These 200 years, the whole Tamilnadu and Kerala&nbsp;as well&nbsp; of eastern part of present Karnataka and Southern Andhra (almost like British Madras State during Pre-independent India,)&nbsp;was under the complete control of Cholas. Most importantly except some warring times, the peace prevailed almost in all the part of this particular chola country. <br />&nbsp;<br />Great Philosophers like Ramanuja, Meykantar were born in this period. And intellectual think-tank was highly seen as satisfactory in this period. Naval strength was commandable. Sea pirates were not seen&nbsp;in the eastern sea, so the merchandism was well handled at ports. Economically most of 200 years the chola country was in strongest terms&nbsp;of wealth management..<br />&nbsp;<br />I have taken only positive happenings for defining the Golden Age.

			<div class="content">good number of Far -East annexed under the rule of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>,.....<br /><br />Hi sps sir, not sure we can say annexed. Rajendra efforts were at best clinical assaults aimed at destroying the maritime (ports) power of the srivijayan empire. South east asia maybe...srilanka def yes, maldives ...not sure if it became a domain. Of the far eastern stats - srivijaya based out of modern day palembang to malaya were raised to dust. ( The famous bringing bk of the vijaya thorana)...kambosa desa was showering a lot of gifts ... The chariot inscription plus the kambosa stone. Maybe u could in that sense call them a fiduciary..... So I am not sure if annexation is the right term to put in general. <br /><br />Infact that is what I feel is the main diff between <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> n <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> for eg, worked at expanding chola empire ( <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> fought for him though) but he added real terriories, <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>'s ganges campaign has various versions...incl an incursion.<br /><br />Rgds<br />Vj</div>
