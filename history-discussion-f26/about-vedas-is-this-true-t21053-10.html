			<div class="content">Dear Jagathesh<br />Very interesting most people keep talking about vedas and the various interpretations of their views of it<br />However a few appreciate a simple yet clear doctrine of best practise as a human being...The Thirukural<br /><br />Incidentally folks I have uploaded a Thirukural Pdf with english meaning in our files section if you are interested<br /><br />regrads<br />Sri<br /><br />jagathesh monikandan  wrote:<br />Hi All,<br />I understand that Veda has great principles in it. That doesn't mean that it should be preached here. I think we (Tamils) have rich set of literature which is enough to guide our people.<br />I have few questions.<br />1. Why is 'VEDAS' always learnt or talked about by only certain group of people?<br />2. Why is Sanskrit still used in Temples? Doesn't Tamil contains words to praise God?<br />3. Why does Indian Govt. took such a long time to announce Tamil as a 'Classical Language'?<br />4. Why is certain people (sanskrit) not ready to accept Tamil as root language for all south indian languages (Kannada,Malayalam,Telugu)?<br /><br />I think this GROUP SHOULD GIVE MORE PREFERENCE TO TAMIL and discuss its heritage. I feel We should not allow to use this forum for the purpose that undermine Tamil in any way directly or indirectly.<br /><br />One sad thing is even Tamils (not all) are giving due respect to Tamil not to mention about other societies.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jaga<br /><br /><br />Venkateswaran Kasirajan  wrote:<br />Keerthi,<br /><br />Well said!<br /><br />Vedas should be translated properly in all regional<br />languages of India and preached!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />--- Keerthivasan Keerthivasan<br /> wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hello,<br /> <br />  It is unfortunate that people comment on Vedas<br />  without<br />  proper knowledge or information. Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.<br /> <br />  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire &#40;agni&#41; as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good.<br /> <br />  Agni ? the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5<br /> <br />  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda&#39;s subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment.<br /> <br />  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.<br /> <br /> <br />  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "SamhitÃ¤s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and SÃ¤maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the SamhitÃ¤s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."<br /> <br />  According to the RgVeda samhitÃ¤ it?s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhitÃ¤, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhitÃ¤ and SÃ¤maVeda samhitÃ¤<br />  also.<br /> <br />  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhitÃ¤s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and SÃ¤maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom &#40;apaurusheya&#41;.<br /> <br />  SamhitÃ¤s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  SamhitÃ¤ speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.<br /> <br />  BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to SamhitÃ¤s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhitÃ¤s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhitÃ¤s, composers of BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  SamhitÃ¤s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.<br /> <br />  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of BrÃ¤mhaÃ«a<br />  texts is neither found in samhitÃ¤ nor in BrÃ¤mhaÃ«a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus SamhitÃ¤s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  SÃ¤maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these SamhitÃ¤s are the main Vedas<br />  for which BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as become ancillaries.<br /> <br />  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;<br />  Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.<br /> <br />  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc<br /> <br />  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.<br /> <br />  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.<br /> <br />  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya ? the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma ? the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.<br /> <br />  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.<br /> <br />  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature ? both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.<br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />  Again Keerthivasan writing:<br /> <br />  Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />  doesn&#39;t speak a single word against women. In<br />  Atharva<br />  Veda it says that the King should have army<br />  regiments<br />  made of women. It even makes it very clear that<br />  widow<br />  remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice.<br /> <br />  To demystify Vedas, we &#40;a small group&#41; are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &<br />  Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.<br /> <br />  With regards,<br />  Keerthivasan.R<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Tired of spam?

We basically started discussing Ponniyin Selvan and Kalki.Thanks due to the inputs of many experts in history, we as a group including a novice like myself started discussing many things beyond <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>,but related to the culture and heritage of our COUNTRY. Vedas are part of our culture. In my opinion there is nothing wrong to highlight their values, especially when they are subjected to unjustified criticism. By doing this we are not comparing or demeaning other literary works of Tamil or any other Language.<br />My humble opinion.<br />Thanks<br />Sundar<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />How low will we go?

Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.<br /> <br />  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire &#40;agni&#41; as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good.<br /> <br />  Agni ? the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5<br /> <br />  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda&#39;s subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment.<br /> <br />  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.<br /> <br /> <br />  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "SamhitÃ¤s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and SÃ¤maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the SamhitÃ¤s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."<br /> <br />  According to the RgVeda samhitÃ¤ it?s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhitÃ¤, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhitÃ¤ and SÃ¤maVeda samhitÃ¤<br />  also.<br /> <br />  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhitÃ¤s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and SÃ¤maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom &#40;apaurusheya&#41;.<br /> <br />  SamhitÃ¤s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  SamhitÃ¤ speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.<br /> <br />  BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to SamhitÃ¤s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhitÃ¤s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhitÃ¤s, composers of BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  SamhitÃ¤s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.<br /> <br />  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of BrÃ¤mhaÃ«a<br />  texts is neither found in samhitÃ¤ nor in BrÃ¤mhaÃ«a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus SamhitÃ¤s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  SÃ¤maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these SamhitÃ¤s are the main Vedas<br />  for which BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as become ancillaries.<br /> <br />  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;<br />  Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.<br /> <br />  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc<br /> <br />  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.<br /> <br />  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.<br /> <br />  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya ? the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma ? the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.<br /> <br />  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.<br /> <br />  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature ? both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.<br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />  Again Keerthivasan writing:<br /> <br />  Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />  doesn&#39;t speak a single word against women. In<br />  Atharva<br />  Veda it says that the King should have army<br />  regiments<br />  made of women. It even makes it very clear that<br />  widow<br />  remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice.<br /> <br />  To demystify Vedas, we &#40;a small group&#41; are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &<br />  Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.<br /> <br />  With regards,<br />  Keerthivasan.R<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Tired of spam?

That doesn't stop us from discussing similar topics.<br />Moreover this group is dedicated for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> topic discussion. Members may be frustrated by the topics which are irrelevent. Not all the members will come out and express themselves. Most members are silent listeners. So, they should not be neglected.

			<div class="content">Hi,<br />The hot debate over here actually made me read deep into the issue. I have came across similar views (as the source of this discussion) in quite a lot of places.<br /><br />Please go through this 'wikipedia' about 'Vedas' .(The contents under 'Critisism of Vedas' and source of the discussion have similar views).

Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.<br /> <br />  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire &#40;agni&#41; as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good.<br /> <br />  Agni ? the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5<br /> <br />  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda&#39;s subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment.<br /> <br />  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.<br /> <br /> <br />  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "SamhitÃ¤s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and SÃ¤maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the SamhitÃ¤s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."<br /> <br />  According to the RgVeda samhitÃ¤ it?s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhitÃ¤, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhitÃ¤ and SÃ¤maVeda samhitÃ¤<br />  also.<br /> <br />  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhitÃ¤s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and SÃ¤maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom &#40;apaurusheya&#41;.<br /> <br />  SamhitÃ¤s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  SamhitÃ¤ speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.<br /> <br />  BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to SamhitÃ¤s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhitÃ¤s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhitÃ¤s, composers of BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  SamhitÃ¤s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.<br /> <br />  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of BrÃ¤mhaÃ«a<br />  texts is neither found in samhitÃ¤ nor in BrÃ¤mhaÃ«a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus SamhitÃ¤s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  SÃ¤maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these SamhitÃ¤s are the main Vedas<br />  for which BrÃ¤mhaÃ«as become ancillaries.<br /> <br />  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;<br />  Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.<br /> <br />  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc<br /> <br />  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.<br /> <br />  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.<br /> <br />  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya ? the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma ? the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.<br /> <br />  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.<br /> <br />  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature ? both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.<br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />  Again Keerthivasan writing:<br /> <br />  Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />  doesn&#39;t speak a single word against women. In<br />  Atharva<br />  Veda it says that the King should have army<br />  regiments<br />  made of women. It even makes it very clear that<br />  widow<br />  remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice.<br /> <br />  To demystify Vedas, we &#40;a small group&#41; are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &<br />  Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.<br /> <br />  With regards,<br />  Keerthivasan.R<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Tired of spam?

			<div class="content">'Mama' is a beautiful word in tamil. a child utters this word first <br />and hence the mothers brother is called mama in tamil, meaning twice <br />as lovable as (am)ma...love and affection beyond the childs mother..<br /><br />During my childhood days, I used to call all our neighbours and <br />family friends as 'mama-mami' irrespective of whether they are <br />brahmins or not. But our society has corrupted these two words that <br />today we hesitate to utter these words. Mama is linked to a filthy <br />profession and mami an notorious word used in films to depict <br />bhrahmin ladies in bad light. But the original words meant different.<br /><br />Today when someone utters mama or mami a good person takes it in the <br />right sense of a good relationship. a pervert will surely take it <br />otherwise and laugh.<br /><br />same words different meaning to different people. Being good or <br />pervert is in our hands. If one word can be twisted like this, think <br />about a language like tamil or sanskrit which has thousand meanings <br />to each words. The anti-vedic and anti-brahminic people will <br />definitely like to take the wrong meaning and the good will take the <br />good. <br /><br />Its in our hands to be perverts or not.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, jagathesh monikandan <br />   wrote:<br />  ......
