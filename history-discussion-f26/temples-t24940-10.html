What was thought impossible yesterday may become <br />possible today. Our kings cannot be fitted into today's definition of <br />ego. It is like questioning if a person killed hitler before WW2, is <br />he good or bad. Historical events should be analysed with the <br />background of those days.

Whether Temples give History ?<br />           <br />            The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the<br />  temple. SI<br />            inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam,<br />      Valarau,<br />            Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written<br />  based<br />      on<br />            these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar<br />  data.<br />           <br />            Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain<br />      more<br />            flattery.<br />           <br />            Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we<br />      will<br />        be<br />            left with only Literature.<br />           <br />            2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder : <br />           <br />            Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders<br />      have<br />            constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including<br />      the<br />        one<br />            indicated here.<br />           <br />            Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..<br />            Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the<br />      gradeure of<br />            the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement,<br />      then<br />        may<br />            be EGO is not the wrong selection.<br />           <br />            Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka<br />        &#40;which<br />            Kalki describes&#41; and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood<br />      state?<br />           <br />            3.

This <br />excercise is being continued..<br /><br />State Archeology was formed when Dr. MGR learnt of the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> / Mysore <br />details and Dr. Nagaswamy (now writes in Tamil Arts Academy) was its <br />first Director (in about 1977 or so )- who published State Archelogy <br />series - District / Taluk wise In Thanjai Dt :: Thiruthuraipoondi - <br />Thiruvalanchuzhi - Papanasam etc., for Thanjai, Darmapuri Dt, <br />Pudukkottai, Kanyakumari etc., etc.    <br /><br />Under Special sanction from MGR Xerox machines capable of taking <br />full scale xerox of 4' x 6' sheets were IMPORTED about 30 years back <br />for State Archeology !!

Can we take out <br />upper <br />      floor <br />          stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />        comparatively <br />          safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn&#39;t it? <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-&#41;" title="Wink" /><br />        <br />        Hi<br />        exactly<br />        there comes the ego of the builder.<br />        20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the temple <br />    after <br />        himself.<br />        know who I am talking about.<br />        venketesh<br />      ==============================<br />      Let us consider the matters on hand : <br />      <br />      1. Whether Temples give History ?<br />      <br />      The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the <br />temple. <br />  SI <br />      inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, <br />Valarau, <br />      Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based <br />on <br />      these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.<br />      <br />      Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to <br />contain <br />    more <br />      flattery.<br />      <br />      Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we <br />will <br />    be <br />      left with only Literature.<br />      <br />      2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder : <br />      <br />      Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders <br />have <br />      constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including <br />the <br />    one <br />      indicated here.<br />      <br />      Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />      Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the <br />gradeure <br />  of <br />      the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, <br />then <br />    may <br />      be EGO is not the wrong selection.<br />      <br />      Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <br />  &#40;which <br />      Kalki describes&#41; and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood <br />state?<br />      <br />      3. Single story / Multi-storied structure :: <br />      <br />      A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data <br />that : <br />      <br />      i&#41; Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <br />    centres;<br />      ii&#41; Provided employment to several<br />      iii&#41; inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />      iv&#41; place of safeguarding food-produces<br />      v&#41; Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />      vi&#41; Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />      vii&#41; Presence of Government establishment &#40;as MANDRAMs <br />were <br />      held under the shade of Trees only &#41;- linked the Village / <br />  Panchyat <br />      with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />      viii&#41; Entertainment<br />      ix&#41; Associated with Educational Establishments <br />      <br />      <br />      4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in <br />certain <br />      Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type &#40;like <br />      Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja <br />  Perumal <br />      etc.&#41;.. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />      archieves.<br />      <br />      Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that <br />  tall <br />      and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the <br />Entrance <br />      also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / <br />intrusion.<br />      <br />      This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam <br />&#40;Siva <br />    run&#41; <br />      covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <br />    Narayana <br />      are the presiding deities and the devotees &#40;more than 100 in <br />      numbers&#41; commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva & <br />      Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and <br />conclude <br />      Sivarathri night!<br />      <br />      Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.<br />      <br />      regards / <br />      <br />      sps</div></blockquote></div>
