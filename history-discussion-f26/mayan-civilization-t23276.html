Instead of a king, they were ruled by a<br />high priest called Kukulcan and here is the deal...he was seated on a<br />throne of Jaguar (their prime symbol is the Jaguar).<br /><br />Their acoustics in temples was brilliant. <br /><br />Their religious grouping was based on simple principles, our guide was<br />a mexican christian who felt it was ridiculous that the Mayan thought<br />Rain was God and Sun was God etc... <br /><br />The evident truth was, not much literature of Mayan, a religion<br />without a spiritual base and not much technical superiority compared<br />to Chola dynasty, however, their construction was similar to our<br />architecture.

			<div class="content">dear ravi<br /><br />heard this from a friend, maybe you know of this kind of ettiquette <br />for travel in peru.....be careful with the word chola/cholo or <br />cholita, meaning indÃ­gena. This may be used affectionately among <br />indigenous people (it'a very common appellation for a child, for <br />instance) but is offensive coming from an outsider.</div>

			<div class="content">Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like to note are: <br /><br />1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this planet<br />were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with indigneous<br />culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />paganist & pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient<br />roots through various literatures (particularly german literature),<br />and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />that one of the german tribes are following.<br /><br />2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, California<br />was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie, in our<br />ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and reached out<br />of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />was exactly the other end of india.<br /><br />3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole world. In<br />Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and havoc.<br />Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to perish,<br />if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />rather every event is a chain to some previous events. <br />In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be auspicious.<br /><br />Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to the whole<br />world.<br />With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it seems to<br />come true.<br /><br />My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &<br />Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />world.  <br />India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim people from<br />such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam destructed, our<br />muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus closing<br />the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with Hindus.<br />(today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin roots, and<br />personally & secretly preserving it. The same with case of malaysian<br />and indonesian leaders, secretly preserving their pre-islamic traditions)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br />   <br />    Another point I forgot to mention was the sculpture on the walls.<br />    There is a certain game, of pushing a ball through a hoop <br />  &#40;symbolic of<br />    the cycle of the sun&#41;, if the team &#40;comprising of the strongest of<br />    army men&#41; cannot do so, their lead is beheaded.
