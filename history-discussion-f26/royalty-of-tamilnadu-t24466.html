			<div class="content">I though during 1279 Pandyas werre well into thier 2nd or 3rd generation of<br />rule after they comprehensively defeated the Cholas and wiped out thier<br />remnants. Also i thought the Delhi sultanate defeated the Hoysalas and thier<br />next battle was with the Pandyas (if u can call that a battle, the Pandays<br />ran away and left my poor Madurai to Malik).<br />I think Mr.Venkatesh can correct or clarify this. These subjects have been<br />discussed so many times by us and probably by a lot of scholars. The lack of<br />documentation or lack in preservation of documentation is just ridiculous.<br />Stone is supposed to be the hardiest of elements, its able to withstand<br />rain,storm, heat, everything except mankind. Just imagine if everythin were<br />to be written in paper or cloth instead of stone carvings. Nothing would<br />have remained and the British would have convinced us that we were cavemen<br />before they came.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br /><br />On 9/28/06, s.balasubramani  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear venkatesh<br />  what u required about royal clans can be get it from the following<br />  website<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uq.net.au/%7Ezzhsoszy/ips/misc/chola.html">http://www.uq.net.au/%7Ezzhsoszy/ips/misc/chola.html</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  CHOLA &#40;Empire&#41;<br /> <br />  LOCATION: Southern India ANNEXATION: 1279<br />  DYNASTY: Chola RELIGION: Hindu<br /> <br />  PREDECESSORS and SHORT HISTORY: Chola disrupted by defeat at the<br />  hands of the Delhi Sultanate in 1279.

			<div class="content">Hi Mr.Venketesh<br /><br />I remember you talking about this tapestry during our meeting in Chennai. It<br />looks really beautiful. Infact it is hard to believe that it is 6 centuries<br />old. The colors are still so brilliant even though these should have been<br />painted using vegetable dyes (please correct if wrong) rather than oils and<br />other chemicals we use today. Even the edges of the tapestry have not been<br />frayed, brilliant!!!<br /><br />And thanks for clearing the matter about the Pandyas wiping out the Cholas<br />before Malik's arrival.

			<div class="content">Hi Mr.Venketesh;<br /><br />Ive read about and seen photographs about this Shroud of Turin. I think<br />there was a controversy on the authenticity of this Shroud. Its pretty well<br />preserved too for such an old relic.<br /><br />Every morning in Jaya TV news they have a segment called "Kala Chuvadugal".<br />this programs shows a number of temples, palace buildings in ruins. It<br />really feels sad we are unable to preserve our incredible history and<br />heritage.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br />On 9/29/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Rahul<br /> <br />  Lots of history in europe seems to be on materiels other than stone<br />  and seem to have been better preserved than our stone.<br /> <br />  follow this link to read about the shroud of the turin which since<br />  1357 is acknowledged/denounced as the last shroud that covered jesus<br />  christ after his death. his image seems to have been imprinted on it.<br /> <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  regards<br />  venketesh</div></blockquote><br /><br />--<br />Creative Director<br />Kalki Technologies<br />Mobile:0091-9345213804<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kalkitechnologies.co.in">http://www.kalkitechnologies.co.in</a><!-- w --></div>
