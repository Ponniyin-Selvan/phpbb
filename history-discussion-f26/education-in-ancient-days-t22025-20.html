			<div class="content">Along with other excellent questions by Thiru Vijay Kumar.<br /><br />- Karikalan vs Raja Raja Chola as the builder of the big Kovil. Why <br />was the tradition of the people not trusted? Any reason or just <br />because they were treated as degraded hindus not to be trusted with <br />their own history. What is the possibility that Karikalan build the <br />Kovil but somebody else(or may be Raja Raja Cholan) wrote the <br />inscription and Raja Raja Cholan got the credit. Personally I do not <br />know. Which side has to be believed the inscriptions or the people's <br />traditions and the detailed reasons for the conclusion.<br />- How did the legend of Karikalan building the Kovil arise. Was the <br />legend of Karikalan more powerful than Raja Raja Cholan that people   <br />assigned everything to Karikalan. What was the basis of Karikalan's <br />popularity among the people - any poems, dramas etc? Or did some <br />great propagandist(like the case of modern media) came and <br />brainwashed the people.<br />- private property is a new concept so registration of documents is <br />ruled out. Western private property is different from Tamil grants. <br />So what was the reason for inscriptions?<br />- Pallikudam (Palli, pallivasal are they Jain, Kudam - kudal?) were <br />they Jain teaching institution with Jain teachers.<br />- Are the scripts used in the inscriptions same as today. If not why <br />was it changed ? If so why did people people think that Karikalan <br />build the Kovil?<br />- Has there been research on the inscriptions itself like were the <br />inscriptions rearranged and if rearranged was it done by people who <br />understood the inscriptions or had they become illiterate by then. <br />Were the inscriptions transcribed whether by literate or illiterate <br />people?<br /><br /><br />Sometimes thinking aloud also helps .. everybody. No thoughts are <br />stupid thoughts as long as one think's and analyzes. Every seeming <br />failure adds to knowledge.<br /><br />Thanks for the interesting posts and sharing knowledge. Special <br />thanks to Vijay.<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"  <br />  wrote: <br />    <br />    how many pages of text do you think all the kalvettus of chola <br />chera <br />    pandya will fill.<br />    my guess is close to a million pages if you put all the edicts <br />text <br />    available today.<br />    <br />    how were these people taught?<br />    venketesh<br />  <br />  hmmm.....point to ponder...any written exhibit in a public place is <br />  surely meant for reading.

			<div class="content">Venkat,<br /><br />I dont think Tamil took a back stage during the telugu/maratha <br />rule.Every now and then either a saint or peot became prominant. <br />Avvaiyar's athi chudi is till date one of the first things taught to <br />a Tamil child. How this is in practice for nearly 2000 years? May be <br />during the 14-19 century, other languages also had prominence and <br />due to political instability and insecure feeling of the people not <br />much was done during these days.<br /><br />14th Century - Kumaraguruparar stood as a becon light of <br />spirutuality and tamil propaganda. If TulasiDas can get inspired by <br />Kumaraguruparar's Kamba Ramayana discourse and set on to write <br />Ramacharita manas, then we can understand the impact of his <br />discourse on Tamil people.<br /><br />Later days saints like Patinathar, arunagiri nathar, abirami pattar -<br />did a great deal to tamil and spirutaul renaiscence. <br /><br />Time is not always the same and swings from one end to other. A full <br />circle is the law of nature. I myself has posed questions in this <br />group as, before Thyagarja, what keerthanai's were sung by our <br />carnatic singers? Does it mean that only after thyagarajar carnatic <br />music came to limelight? Not so. <br /><br />Again quoting U.ve.Sa, he mentions about great many carnatic singers <br />of that era (either contemprory or prior to Thyagarja) who excelled <br />in carnatic music and the compostions they made in tamil. <br />unfortunate that all are lost and due to some reason only telugu <br />keerthina's are in vogue.<br /><br />1000 years of Non-hindu and non-local's rule (not only in tamil nadu <br />but entire India) has done a lot of damage to our roots. It will <br />surely take some time to heal. When the current generation has <br />understood that today's education system is not up to the mark, <br />there is some ray of hope that our olden days practices can be <br />revived.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

If not<br />why<br />  was it changed ? If so why did people people think that Karikalan<br />  build the Kovil?<br />  - Has there been research on the inscriptions itself like were the<br />  inscriptions rearranged and if rearranged was it done by people who<br />  understood the inscriptions or had they become illiterate by then.<br />  Were the inscriptions transcribed whether by literate or illiterate<br />  people?<br /> <br /> <br />  Sometimes thinking aloud also helps .. everybody. No thoughts are<br />  stupid thoughts as long as one think&#39;s and analyzes. Every seeming<br />  failure adds to knowledge.<br /> <br />  Thanks for the interesting posts and sharing knowledge.

Meaning, we can well assume that most<br />of<br />  the<br />    ancient people &#40;atleast 1000 y ears from now&#41; were able to read<br />and<br />    write.<br />    On the other hand, we can look at it altogether with a different<br />    perspective. Kalvettus are sort of legan documents something like<br />    registration being done today. If some property is<br />    transacted/exchanged, it has to be registered. How many of the<br />  people<br />    who buy sell property today, read the entire text of say, 20 page<br />  of<br />    document on the stamp papers? Most of us assume that its perfect<br />    &#40;trust the person who prepared the document&#41; and sign blindly<br />  without<br />    reading. even people who know to read and write fall in this<br />  categaroy.<br />   <br />    On these lines, these kalvettu&#39;s can also be registration<br />  documents,<br />    which is there just for legal purpose without bothering whether<br />  anyone<br />    reads or writes.<br />   <br />    Another point to look at is, as SPS quotes often, till british<br />  found<br />    out that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> built big temple, everyone thought it was built by<br />    Karikalan. The kalvettu in big temple are supposed to be the best<br />    handwriting &#40;?&#41; &#40;as per Lavanya, ruled note-la ezhudhinapla&#41; but<br />  for<br />    centuries no one even bothered to read that themselves.<br />   <br />    So what heppened in the middled? Suddenly people became<br />illitrate?<br />  or<br />    from ancient time itself people were illitrate? yosikka yosikka<br />  romba<br />    kozhapputhu...<br />    But I am still sure, people &#40;almost part of the society&#41; were<br />well<br />    educated in olden times, irrespective of whether litrate or<br />  illitrate.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />With best wishes<br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />5, 50, 500, 5000 - Store N number of mails in your inbox.

			<div class="content">The Tamils had a huge written tradition. I sent some<br />links to this effect few days back.<br /><br />After a poetry was sung at the Tamil Cankam and<br />accepted by poets, it might have been copied and<br />circulated to people. There might have been a central<br />repository at the Tamil Cankam.
