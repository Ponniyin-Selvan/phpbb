			<div class="content">Dear Mr Muruganantham;<br />I dont want to deviate from the topic but i felt it was high time somebody<br />stopped people criticising cricket for everything that happens in the<br />country.<br />Every country has its own passions, likes and dislikes. Cricket is much more<br />than a sport, do u know why? It is the only way in which a commoner can<br />become a national hero within a space of a year. I know there are politics<br />involved in there (i played for Tamilnadu, so been there done that) but<br />there are enough rags to riches stories in cricket. Sehwag,Dhoni were all<br />commoners much like us before they played for the country.<br />Name one sport/field where a lower-middle class boy can dream of becoming<br />the best in the world without emptying his family fortune. Cricket is the<br />only sport in India where a lower-middle class boy knows he can earn a<br />living even if he doesn't make it to the top.<br />Do you know what one has to spend in motorsports (car racing) to even know<br />whether we are any good in that?<br />There are enough real-life events in cricket to rival the commoner-to-king<br />scripts of Dumas and Kalki.<br />"Cricket is a religion"--A religion where the<br />rich,poor,Hindu,Muslim,Maharaja(Raja of Vizianagaram),commoner,high<br />caste.low caste play together as a team with the sole aim of helping India<br />win. This is probably the only religion which could be benficial to India.<br /><br />So lets stop criticising cricket for the evils of our country. That sport<br />does not deserve this.

			<div class="content">Dear Rahul,<br /><br />If you see my mail, I am not blaming cricket or cinema for all the evils. I<br />am blaming only "us" that we treat this as religion beyond the actual levels<br />of sports or entertainment. Yes, every country and people have their own<br />passions. I believe you would appreciate the fact of differentiation between<br />"being passionate" and "being fanatic"; "Being fanatic" in our country<br />leads to heights of negligence of various prime duties.<br /><br />Do you know how many commoners spend their daily wages for these so-called<br />cinema / cricket ?<br />On top of it, betting scandals, mudslinging politics to capture huge<br />revenue-earning body (ie., BCCI) are going on in this country.<br /><br />Is it really justified for the salary being drawn by superstars in cinema<br />and superheroes of cricket ? Let us ponder over this and analyze in a more<br />constructive way.<br /><br />I remember in one of the TV interviews, Director Cheran mentioned that he<br />was ready to work like a normal employee (for a monthly salary of say<br />Rs.15k) if all the other actors/technicians could settle in for similar<br />salaries pertain to their potential only. Under those circumstances, cost of<br />production of cinema would come down.<br /><br />It is really mind boggling to the amounts of money involved in cinema<br />industry and profits (!!!) involved...<br /><br /><br /><br />Anbudan<br /><br />Muruganantham<br /><br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com<br />[mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of Rahul dhinakaran<br />Sent: Tuesday, July 25, 2006 12:15 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Reg: Freedom Fighters of Tamil Nadu.<br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Mr Muruganantham;<br />I dont want to deviate from the topic but i felt it was high time somebody<br />stopped people criticising cricket for everything that happens in the<br />country.<br />Every country has its own passions, likes and dislikes.

			<div class="content">Dear Mr.Muruganantham;<br /><br />Do you think that by banning cricket/cinema that people would start sudying<br />about VOC,Bharathiar,etc? Infact a whole generation of Indians, Tamilians<br />especially got to know about these incredible people through cinema only. If<br />during a discussion the name "Kattabomman" crops up we imgaine Sivaji<br />Ganesan mouthin dialogues. Cinema has done a quite a lot for keeping alive<br />the names of such great people.<br /><br />Why is the salary of cricketers always an issue of debate? Do we debate on<br />how much a fresher from an engineering college is paid for joinging a<br />software company?<br />Regarding scandals of the BCCI name one body in the world which does not<br />have its own share of scandals. Did you hear about the match fixing scandals<br />which rocked football last month? Cricket is no way related to the evils of<br />our country. <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym> for every commoner spending his daily wages on cricket and<br />cinema there are atleast 2 families which are making money from both in one<br />way or the other. Cricket and cinema are multi-million dollar industries<br />which are sources of living for thousands.<br /><br />every person has his own share of problems and cinema and cricket are 2<br />mediums where he can forget them for sometime. Banning cricket/cinema would<br />not turn thier attention to VOC,Bharathiar.<br /><br />Infact to turn thier to attention to such heroes we have use cinema as a<br />medium. A good movie on these heroes by a director who knows how to attract<br />the masses, having a lot of drama would turn the attention of the people to<br />the struggles of these heroes.

Cricket is much<br />  more than a sport, do u know why? It is the only way in which a commoner can<br />  become a national hero within a space of a year. I know there are politics<br />  involved in there &#40;i played for Tamilnadu, so been there done that&#41; but<br />  there are enough rags to riches stories in cricket. Sehwag,Dhoni were all<br />  commoners much like us before they played for the country.<br />  Name one sport/field where a lower-middle class boy can dream of becoming<br />  the best in the world without emptying his family fortune. Cricket is the<br />  only sport in India where a lower-middle class boy knows he can earn a<br />  living even if he doesn&#39;t make it to the top.<br />  Do you know what one has to spend in motorsports &#40;car racing&#41; to even know<br />  whether we are any good in that?<br />  There are enough real-life events in cricket to rival the commoner-to-king<br />  scripts of Dumas and Kalki.<br />  "Cricket is a religion"--A religion where the<br />  rich,poor,Hindu,Muslim,Maharaja&#40;Raja of Vizianagaram&#41;,commoner,high<br />  caste.low caste play together as a team with the sole aim of helping India<br />  win. This is probably the only religion which could be benficial to India.<br /> <br />  So lets stop criticising cricket for the evils of our country. That sport<br />  does not deserve this.

Infact a whole generation of Indians, Tamilians especially got to know about these incredible people through cinema only. If during a discussion the name "Kattabomman" crops up we imgaine Sivaji Ganesan mouthin dialogues. Cinema has done a quite a lot for keeping alive the names of such great people.<br /><br />Why is the salary of cricketers always an issue of debate? Do we debate on how much a fresher from an engineering college is paid for joinging a software company?<br />Regarding scandals of the BCCI name one body in the world which does not have its own share of scandals. Did you hear about the match fixing scandals which rocked football last month? Cricket is no way related to the evils of our country. <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym> for every commoner spending his daily wages on cricket and cinema there are atleast 2 families which are making money from both in one way or the other. Cricket and cinema are multi-million dollar industries which are sources of living for thousands.<br /><br />every person has his own share of problems and cinema and cricket are 2 mediums where he can forget them for sometime. Banning cricket/cinema would not turn thier attention to VOC,Bharathiar.<br /><br />Infact to turn thier to attention to such heroes we have use cinema as a medium. A good movie on these heroes by a director who knows how to attract the masses, having a lot of drama would turn the attention of the people to the struggles of these heroes. Cinema reaches the lowest and the highest segments of the society.<br /><br />"The pen maybe mightier than the sword but a camera is mightier than the pen"<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br />On 7/25/06, B.Muruganantham  wrote: Dear Rahul,<br /><br />If you see my mail, I am not blaming cricket or cinema for all the evils. I am blaming only "us" that we treat this as religion beyond the actual levels of sports or entertainment. Yes, every country and people have their own passions. I believe you would appreciate the fact of differentiation between "being passionate" and "being fanatic"; "Being fanatic" in our country leads to heights of negligence of various prime duties.<br /><br />Do you know how many commoners spend their daily wages for these so-called cinema / cricket ?<br />On top of it, betting scandals, mudslinging politics to capture huge revenue-earning body (ie., BCCI) are going on in this country.<br /><br />Is it really justified for the salary being drawn by superstars in cinema and superheroes of cricket ? Let us ponder over this and analyze in a more constructive way.<br /><br />I remember in one of the TV interviews, Director Cheran mentioned that he was ready to work like a normal employee (for a monthly salary of say Rs.15k) if all the other actors/technicians could settle in for similar salaries pertain to their potential only. Under those circumstances, cost of production of cinema would come down.<br /><br />It is really mind boggling to the amounts of money involved in cinema industry and profits (!!!) involved...<br /><br /><br /><br />Anbudan<br /><br />Muruganantham<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com[mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of Rahul dhinakaran<br />Sent: Tuesday, July 25, 2006 12:15 PM<br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br /><br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Reg: Freedom Fighters of Tamil Nadu.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Mr Muruganantham;<br />I dont want to deviate from the topic but i felt it was high time somebody stopped people criticising cricket for everything that happens in the country.<br />Every country has its own passions, likes and dislikes.
