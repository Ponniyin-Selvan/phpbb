			<div class="content"><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Now let us slightly go back to POST GAZNI - or Malik Gafur in <br />  Southern India &#40;say 1350 AD&#41; Just prior to Vijayanagara &#40;in about <br />  1500 AD&#41;!<br />  <br />  From about 1320 AD - Tamilnadu confronted with the following:</div></blockquote>Dear sps<br /><br />Just today i was seeing this reference...talk of <br />coincidences.....also venkat your madurai - when is it going to come <br />out in tamil...<br /><br />1311C.E.- Attacks by Malik Kafur, the general of Allauddin Khilji: <br /><br />According the traditional accounts, the Muslim army lead by Malik <br />Kafur entered the Srirangam temple throught the northern gateway of <br />the 3rd enclosure. The resistance of the Brahmins was overcome <br />easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and numerous <br />icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray however did <br />not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all the <br />treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The temple <br />rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.<br /><br />1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam temple: <br /><br />Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest son <br />Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in 1321 C.E. <br />When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of which the <br />procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby shrine. The <br />gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and the <br />festival was continued. When the invaders reached Samayapuram, <br />Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the temple, <br />decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away the <br />procession image of the deity in the southern direction secretly, <br />with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, he <br />dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few boxes <br />of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the doors <br />of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines of both <br />Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images outside <br />and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, including the <br />great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri Vedanta <br />Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the sole <br />manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri Sudarsana, <br />and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, they <br />fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika published <br />the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally housed in <br />the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after Pillai <br />Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his kith <br />and kin at Srirangam.<br /><br />The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an end to <br />Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the invading <br />general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple altogether, <br />and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few cornices. The <br />Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the occupying <br />Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked by <br />disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved to the <br />nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />fortress at its place. <br /><br />The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the mention <br />of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the Muslim <br />chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the pretext of <br />showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and killed <br />him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a result of <br />her deed, she threw herself also down. According to tradition, to <br />honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are lit by <br />fire brought from the temple kitchen.<br /><br />In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar wrested <br />back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon hidden <br />at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.<br /><br />1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French: <br /><br />During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of the <br />French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the temple, and <br />were planning on harassing the entire population that had taken <br />refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy on <br />behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist of the <br />harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the occupying <br />troops, including the molestation of women. The inner precincts of <br />the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers of <br />the army of Chanda Saheb. <br /><br />1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali: <br /><br />Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded Srirangam in <br />1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the disaster.<br /><br />1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan: <br /><br />Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 C.E. with <br />his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. He <br />stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded 100000 <br />gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The demand was <br />refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, Tippu <br />had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his vengeance <br />upon the temple.<br /><br />________________________<br /><br />The instance below took place during the 'Carnatic Wars' (1743-1763) <br />fought between the British and the French for the control of South <br />India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along these two <br />European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and the <br />Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with the <br />French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab of <br />Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi (1732-36) of <br />the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the indignities <br />heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb's men, the queen took poison and <br />died in 1736. During his rule (1736-1740), Chanda Saheb harassed the <br />temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money from <br />them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading Maratha <br />forces in 1740.<br /><br />"Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga Pillai, <br />the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix ( = the French <br />Commander), states; 'Today I heard the following news. Of the troops <br />at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 troopers have <br />received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money to <br />live on and have suffered much from the enemy's (= the British) <br />blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam temple just <br />as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple people <br />saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the grain <br />stored there." (pg. 212)<br /><br />When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who worked for <br />Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple and <br />ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, the <br />British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.<br /><br />Reference: <br />V. N.

			<div class="content">SPs, I am sorry to disagree. Reading with purpose of<br />understanding and reading with purpose of trashing are<br />completely different. If they read the books to<br />understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />positive, or could not tell public what was true about<br />Ramayana and what was not? I have known westerners,<br />completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana and<br />were very impressed by qualities they found. They did<br />find issues too but not like the mindset the DKites<br />had.<br /><br />I realize you want to close the thread, as this is not<br />going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am just<br />disappointed that you chose to see one member's stance<br />only and conclude based on that.<br /><br />Noone is disputing the need for anti religious, anti<br />caste struggle that started with EVR's leadership. But<br />to continue the line of hate propoganda and label all<br />believers as 'kattu mirandis' and 'mutttaals' is<br />outdated and uncivilised. To do away with 'give and<br />take respect' is even more uncivilised. I have<br />attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />something alternate, just calling 'kadavul illai' is<br />not what one believes in.

			<div class="content">AK, I agree sometimes tone is important. Answer this<br />question for me, if you claim DKites read Ramayana why<br />is it that none of them were able to find anything<br />positive in the story/epic? For centuries even people<br />totally alien to Hinduism have been able to relate to<br />the Ramayana and understand its essence and message.<br /><br />I will tell you why - they read it with purpose of<br />attacking the Brahmin community which often used the<br />epic for developing a poor belief system and keeping<br />others suppressed. It was not an unbiased reading.<br />That might have been valid at some point of time, but<br />we have outgrown that situation now.<br /><br />We have outgrown the situation they were dealing with<br />in many ways now. People in any generation always need<br />a belief system. Athiesm or negating and attacking<br />someone else is not a belief system. Rationatiy by<br />itself is not enough for human beings to deal with<br />life, life has many irrational and completely tough,<br />hard situations that force a human to believe in<br />things beyond. Gandhi said once that his faith in God<br />is not a choice, it is a necessity.<br /><br />Noone negated what these people did for tamils. But to<br />understand what they did not do correctly is also<br />equally important and correct as we grow.<br /><br />Vanakkam,<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- akumarg1976  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar<br />  Arunachalam"<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />   <br />    Another one - Ramayan is interpreted as the fight<br />  between Aryans<br />  and<br />    the dravidians. Arya - Brahmin, Dravidian - Non<br />  Brahmin. But people<br />  who<br />    proposed this failed to take note that Rama was a<br />  non brahmin and<br />    Ravana was a brahmin. So do they mean to say that<br />  the dravidian<br />    defeated aryan?<br />   <br /> <br />  This was already answered in messages 22089 and<br />  22095. Not sure if<br />  you are not convinced or have not read.<br /> <br />    From my experience, if I say something wrong on<br />  misunderstood<br />    something, no one tries to clarify and make me<br />  understand, but<br />  downpour<br />    with trashings pulling out unwanted things.<br /> <br />  It may be because of not able to identify the tone.<br />  There is a<br />  difference between asking a doubt without knowing<br />  the answer and<br />  asking sarcastically with known answer. The level of<br />  submissiveness<br />  differs. But, unfortunately, the latter uses the<br />  same tone of the<br />  formar by wearing the mask of innocent. Answering<br />  the latter&#39;s<br />  question in the same way it is answered to the<br />  formar will make the<br />  replier fool. So, sometimes it creates confusion in<br />  understanding the<br />  real intention of the person who asks the question.<br /> <br />  Regards<br />  A.Kumaraguruparan</div></blockquote><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!
