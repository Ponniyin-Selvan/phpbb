			<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />Please find the proceedings of the workshop held in Chennai from August 11th to 13th, 2006 on the topic "Significance of Vedic Culture in Ancient Dravidian Literature" given below.<br /><br />Some photos taken during the workshop are available in the blog (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://practiceofdharma.blogspot.com">http://practiceofdharma.blogspot.com</a><!-- m -->) along with this write up.<br /><br />With regards,<br />Keerthivasan.R<br /><br /><br />Workshop on Vedas ? Chennai<br /><br />(An experience scrutinizing the Significance of Vedic Culture in Ancient Dravidian Literature)<br /><br />WEBOLIM:<br /><br />Web of Life Makers (Webolim) is an organization, which facilitates people to experience the treasured esoteric Vedic values and inculcate them in their everyday life. It conducts regular camps around the country to elucidate the public on various topics of interest, thereby providing simple yet clear solutions that are always integrated to the ?Big Truth?.<br />This was one such camp [To put it literally, an exquisite experience!], a two day residential workshop in Chennai from August 11th to 13th 2006 with the below objectives;<br /><br />?Research and hence Refresh, the general misconception that Dravidian languages & culture are against Vedas?<br />?To spread the awareness of the similarity of the Vedic and Dravidian roots and the practical usage of Vedic culture in Dravidian life from time immemorial?<br /><br />Venue: VKC Cultural Centre<br />No. 41, Kuppaiah Street<br />West Mambalam, Chennai<br /><br />Inaugural Address ? Dr. Kalyanaraman<br />The camp started with the inaugural ceremony at 7.15 PM on 11th August 2006 (Friday). Dr. Kalyanaraman, Director of Saraswathi Research Centre who had done pioneering work in scientifically proving the Saraswathi River and its relevance to history of India gave the inaugural address.<br /><br /><br /><br />?Introduction to Vedas?? Smt. Dhrushya, Shri. Jaishankar, Shri. Ranganji<br />This session [had three sub sessions in it] prepared the audience with the right kind of tempo that was needed for the workshop by setting the tone right, making the spirits fly high and created a deep thirst for acquiring the true knowledge about the Vedic and Dravidian cultures. Smt. Dhrushya dealt with the structure by detailing on the Systematic Arrangement of the Vedas and explained why out of the four divisions of the Vedas: Samhitha, Brahmana, Aranyaka and Upanishads; the Samhitha assumes a higher importance. The part, Uniqueness of Vedas taken by Shri S.Jaishankar and the final part on ?Why Vedas?? was taken by Shri Ranganji. After these lectures there was a question & answer session.<br /><br />Works by Dravidians on Vedas ? Dr. T.N. Ramachandran<br />The speaker enthralled the audience with his stomping authority and grand style on the various Dravidian works on Vedas. He explained the work of Shri Jambunahtha Iyer who translated Vedas to Tamil and who worked for the welfare of depressed people. He also explained the Tamil translation of Krishna Yajur Veda & Sama Veda by Shivadhyananda Maharishi. Then the work of Shri Kapali Shastri on Rig Veda was explained. That Friday, came to a close as we bid an unwilling adieu!<br /><br />Yoga starts a blissful day ? Shri. Ananthan<br />Saturday dawned with a salubrious yoga session presented by Shri. Ananthan from Vivekananda Yoga University, Bangalore. The participants were taken across a pleasant one hour yogic voyage [5.00 am to 6.00 am] through performing some Asanas ? the science of postures and practicing some Pranayamas - the art and science of structured breathing.<br /><br />The Myth of Aryan Invasion ? pondering the fugitive Truth ? Dr. Kalyanaraman<br />The Aryan invasion Theory, one amongst the most controversial stake clouding the facts was taken to task by the veteran scholar in the session. The stage couldn?t have been more suitably set, as Dr. Kalyanaraman, Director of Saraswathi Research Centre who had done pioneering work in scientifically proving the Saraswathi River and its relevance to history of India tore through the Fabricated theory with his logical shafts. Briefly describing how the theory was manufactured and propagated, he took the session on the evidences that are available, contrary to the Aryan Invasion. He pointed out at archeological evidences from nearly 200 Indus valley sites, pointed out linguistic and genetic facts that demolish theory of Aryan Invasion. He quoted the works of many researchers and scholars from the days of Frenchman Marius Fontane (who in 1881 who wrote ?Histoire Universelle, Inde Vedique?). It won?t provoke any awe to state that the session was enlightening with a<br />lot of information providing insight. Hot breakfast followed the wonderful lecture on the hot topic.<br /><br />Modern Tamil and Vedas ? Shri. Ranganji<br />Cometh the Man, Cometh the Hour! The stage was set for the founder President of Webolim to take over. What not? ? He took over in style by delivering a lecture on Modern Tamil and Vedas, showing how Bharathi?s Tamil poems ran high having a good large content of the Vedic concepts in them. The master explained the many translations of Vedic mantras by Bharathi in Tamil. Considering many poems of Bharathi on Agni, Indra and Soma, he threw light on the ?concept of Archetypes? in the Vedas.<br /><br />Vedic Chanting of 26 important Vedic mantras soon followed suit in the ?lead and follow method?. To make the chanting, an enchanting experience, and the meanings of the mantras were explained then and there.<br /><br />Concept of Dharma ? Panel discussion<br />A vast topic, the concept of dharma was discussed with a clinical approach to define dharma universally without having any superimposition of race, gender, caste, religion etc. Using the concepts like Shreyas, Preyas etc a model was presented for deciding an action into dharmic or adharmic. A skills session took place after lunch in which the participants exhibited their talents. This went on till 3.30 in the evening.<br /><br /><br />Life Craft ? Individual narrations<br />The session witnessed all participants narrating numerous events from the immortal epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. The incidents that were narrated were of acute beauty as they were associated with a practical utility in our everyday life. There were nearly 30 or 40 incidents from Ramayana and Mahabharata discussed and clarified. This session went on till 5 pm.<br /><br />Single Culture of the Whole Nation in the light of Ramayana ? Shri. Ranganji<br />A close follower will find out how Shri. Ranganji raises an excitement in the listener by putting forward a lot of questions, forces an inquisitive mind in the listener, creating a small mental restlessness in the listener, which will make him more attentive ? thereby focusing hard on the lecture and finally answers all the listed questions, providing a sense of relief and joy to the listener?s mind. He truly, is a master in this art. This lecture was no exception.<br />Starting with the poorva paksha (Opponents point of view) against the concept of rashtra of Bharatham, Shri Ranganji first listed all the arguments given against concept of a single rashtra of Bharatham like multiple kingdoms and no central ruler or government, multiple languages (not a single common language in India), there is no organized religion (Hinduism is a mess of many faiths, cults and practices) etc.<br />He then went on answer each and every one of these questions and then went to the common factors of India, Vedas, Karma theory (not just an external happening but a internal happening in mind ? Vedic Philosophy) and the culture of seeking the divinity through various methods.<br />Then he went on show the cultural unity across geographies like Kekeya, Koushala, Kasi, Vidheha, Kishkindha, Anga, Vanga, Magadha, Malava, Pundra, Kalinga, Utkala, Kuru, Madhra, Kamboja, Chola, Pandya and Lanka kingdoms. He showed how Valmiki talks about Pandya Kingdom and its earlier capital Kavatapura. He also pointed out the ancient Tamil literature, which says that the first two sangams of Tamil were held in Kavatapura and later how Kavatapura was engulfed by the Sea. With a lot of information on ancient Indian geography, this lecture was one among the treats in the camp.<br /><br />Music Concert - Shri S.Dandapani and Shri Sabareshan<br />?When there is no food for thought, let there be some for the tummy", thus spoke Thiruvalluvar, an ancient Tamil poet.? But the audience was treated to both, a delicious dinner and a marvelous music concert by Shri S.Dandapani in Banjo and his son Shri Sabareshan in Flute. They gave a melodious concert covering various songs and ragas for 90 minutes. Shri Dandapani can play 5 different instruments and propagates culture through music. Saturday, the 12th, died a peaceful and melodious death!<br /><br />Meditation ? Reaching out to the unknown<br />As is the normal custom, Sunday, dawned with Asanas and Meditation. Shri. Ananthan took the chair from 5 to 6.15 in the morning. Vedic Chanting and breakfast kept the schedule running till 9 am.<br /><br />Linguistic Commonalities of Tamil and Vedic Sanskrit ? Shri. Ranganji<br />We were subjected to a presentation that Dr. Rajagopalan compared to one of the best Phd. Presentations he had ever witnessed! ? Such was the command and authority of the presenter. Being an expert, Shri. Ranganji quickly ran through various words in 5 different languages, showed how the words not at all related to each other by an inch, thus claiming that Tamil and Vedic language had no linguistic commonalities. Giving a feel of the European claim, he showed us the other face ? how there existed and still exist numerous commonalities [not only] between Tamil and Vedic language [but also] many other occidental languages with the Sanskrit. He also spoke on Tolkappiyam, which praises Vedic seers, Vedic Mantras and Vedic language. He proved how Maxmuller?s views regarding comparative linguistics are not appropriate and quoted many points from Sri. Aurobindo?s ?Origin of Aryan speech?. He pointed out the similarities in works of Panini (Sanskrit Grammarian) and<br />Tamil grammar.<br /><br />Commonalities of Tamil and Classical Sanskrit - Dr.Rajagopalan<br />A vibrant, clinical Roar ? that?s how the presentation should be put, for those who didn?t enjoy the privilege of attending a classique! He showed how literature of any language is a mirror of that society that existed on that point of time. He then went on to show that, though Tamil and Sanskrit have different linguistic beauty, linguistic perfection, they have a cultural commonality. First he focused on emotional commonalities like, description of Shiva by Kalidasa in Kumarasambhavam and Tamil Saint Thirujnanasambandar. Then he focused on commonalities of everyday emotions like the description of children by Kalidasa in Shakuntala and by Tamil King Arya padai kadantha Nedunchezian in Purananuru, an ancient literature belonging to Tamil Sangam age. He also showed how cultural commonalities are same in Bhasa?s Swapnavavasavadhattam and Saint Andal?s Thirupavai in Tamil. Thus he proved the common collective unconscious psyche of Sanskrit and Tamil poets. The<br />lecturer?s vast lucid portrayals of situations, his visualization of the society and his calm but erudite looks, all made the session an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Vedas and Sangam Literature ? Dr. T.N. Ramachandran<br />Then Dr. T.N. Ramachandran had audience spellbound with his eloquence on how Tamil Sangam literature shows the presence of Vedic culture from time immemorial in his lecture on ?Vedas & Sangam Literature?. He also started with Tolkappiyam, which praises Vedic seers for their fearlessness. He explained how texts like Paripadal, Kurnthogai, Pathitrupattu, Purananuru and Madurai Kanchi etc call the Vedas. He explained how verse 166 of Purananuru has sung about Parpana Vagai (Triumph of Brahmins in their work). He explained how Maduraikanchi talks about the king Palyagasalai Muthukudumi Peruvaludhi who conducted many Vedic yagnas. He gave many examples of Ancient Tamil Kings who conducted Yagnas and also were great poets themselves.<br /><br />Verse 15 of Purananuru talks about the yupa pillars (Pillars erected in Vedic Yagnas) that were erected in Chola capitals. He showed how Agananuru verse 220 compares a heroine to the yupa pillar of Parasurama. Then he showed how there is no evidence of any ?Aryan Invasion? or ?Vedas being imposed? in the huge literature of Tamil Sangam poetry. He also quoted how in later ages Tamil Shaivite and Vaishnavite saints have sung about Vedas. The audience highly appreciated his 1-hour lecture.<br /><br />After lunch participants assembled for another session of ?Life Craft? [it had gained a sudden dalliance from the day before with the participants] where epics were discussed and enjoyed for their beauty and practical application in life. Almost all participants contributed in this session. Concepts of management, public administration, personnel relations etc in Epics were discussed.<br /><br /><br />The next session was the continuation of Modern Tamil and Vedas by Shri Ranganji. He explained how Subramanya Bharathi and Kapali Shastri knew Vedas from the spiritual insight of Shri Aurobindo. He explained how Subramanya Bharathi condemns the superstitious practices in those days and how he explains the Vedas for the welfare of the whole society. Shri Ranganji took Bharathi?s poems on Vedas and explained them word-by-word. The Spasmodic outbursts of Bharathi, the rebel poet, could be felt as the lecturer was in a virulent mood, in tune with his lecture. He also explained the prosaic poems of Bharati which expresses the one reality, one bliss, one conscious force behind all names and forms of this existence. Audience felt that even the very explanation of these poems took them to that experience of oneness.<br /><br />Conclusion ? Dr. Ram Mohan<br />A Tamil scholar speaking about Tamil is really joy to witness. Dr. Ram Mohan, a scholar of Tamil Literature, Vedas, Vedanta, and Buddhism etc. shared his knowledge with us by giving the concluding lecture, where he touched upon all the aspects that were dealt with in the workshop. He also narrated how in Tamil tradition each geographical region had its own Vedic god like Vishnu, Muruga, Indra, Durga and Varuna. He explained how Kalithogai sings about Indra and Vishnu who is on Adi Sesha. He explained how Nachinarkeniyar (a Sangam poet) explains the Veda shakas.<br /><br />He gave how Pathupattu (a Sangam work) talks about the commentaries on Vedas were made by scholars using Vedic grammar, Nirukta, Vedic astronomy and riks in their heart. He mentioned how the poet Murayor Muni Nagarayar in Purananuru mentions about Brahmins performing their rituals in Tamil Nadu and how the King Perunchotru Udaiyan Neduncheraladhan supplied food to the Pandava side of the army in Mahabharatha war. He summarized the various topics of the workshop in his lecture.<br /><br />Mementoes and a Photo Session<br />After presentation of mementoes to the scholars, participants gave their feedback on the workshop. Then there was photo session with the resource persons. With the singing of national anthem the workshop got concluded. The Enrapture was finally over. All that the participants carried back was their delightful memories and a thirst for acquiring more and more of this opulent experience.<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Want to be your own boss?
