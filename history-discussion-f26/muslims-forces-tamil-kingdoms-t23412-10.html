			<div class="content">Sir,<br />I beg to differ here, Hoysalas and Chalukyas were always interferring with someone or the other. Hoysalas have supported cholas against pandiyas and again vice-versa also and Chalukyas were supporting Pandyas and Cholas against Pallavas. Pallavas internal fighting brought about the chola empire, vijaylaya supporting one brother against the other. Muslims were allowed to come in the same way by the Pandyas, who had outlived every other dynasty by that time.<br /><br />Pandyas had began their infighting during the time of cholas(Vira rajendra aiding and fighting Veera Pandian and Vikrama Pandiyan along with Sinhala Dantanayaka & Jagatvijayan. Singala Karunkasu introduced into Pandiya territory at this time). My other question is why Muslim raider, why did they not involve the Sinhala kings, being related to them??<br /><br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br /><br />Since there were no Cholas or Chera or Pallavas, they went for the Delhi Raiders, so it was a logical extensions.<br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />wrote:<br />-Hi<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>the first major muslim invasion was around 1314 ad<br /> <br />  it was that the muslim army had the support of the rebels and natural<br />  enemies of the country thast they were attacking that mattered. in<br />  this caser sundara pandya and the hoysalas under vir bhallaala helped<br />  malik attack madurai.<br />=====================</div></blockquote>It was like this.<br /><br />Out of two brothers one ascended to the throne.

After<br />some time,<br />  the tax proposal and the wall project was dropped.<br /> <br /> <br />  Many years after drooping the proposal Ghajini Mohammed was planning<br />to<br />  visit india and found the kiber pass to be the effortless way to<br />enter. He<br />  succeeded and looted all the wealth and returned .<br /> <br />  He used that route to repeatedly visit india in the 9th/10th<br />century. In a<br />  span of 20 years he made a total of 17 visits. Not even once he<br />failed.<br />  Every time he went back with tones and tonne of gold snatched from<br />the<br />  public.<br /> <br />  When the brilliant ministers proposed to completely close the kiber<br />pass by<br />  building a strong wall, all the people should have contributed<br />immediately<br />  and should have completed it .<br /> <br />  unlike the thousands of kilometer length of the great wall of china,<br />this<br />  wall needed to be just a few kilometres long . The money and effort<br />needed<br />  to build the wall was not even point one percent of what was lost<br />for not<br />  contributing the construction of the wall.<br /> <br />  The morel of the story : Contribute for the right common cause.<br />  &#40; btw this is not a story.<br />  this is a recorded history of india&#41;<br /> <br />  "R.venketesh"  wrote:<br /><br />  Malik&#39;s incursion into the south was resisted by the kakatiyas of<br />  warrangal, the yadavas of deogiri and hoysalas.<br />  malik conquered all of them in different ways. but in a way he was<br />  focussed. he never wanted to rule the lands he conquered but only<br />used<br />  them as stepping stones for further conquest.<br />  there were reports that he wanted to use the pandya kingdom as a<br />  spring board for a naval expedition to srilanka<br /> <br />  kafur was only after gold.<br />  the delhi sultanate was regularly attacked by mongols from central<br />  asia and had to maintain a huge army.<br />  the gold that was conquered from the south atleast served one<br />purpose.<br />  it helped stop mongols at the gates of delhi.<br /> <br />  another thing that helped malik take madurai was speed. he found<br />  absolutely no resistance till the gates of madurai. that was mainly<br />  because the pandyas had exterminated almost all dynasties including<br />  the cholas.<br /> <br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  How low will we go?

			<div class="content">Hi Nanda<br /><br />the pandyas had a mini civil war( not the huge one in the earlier <br />century) just a few decades before malik came.<br /><br />two brothers were pitted against each other. kulasekaran the king and <br />vikrama his brother and the commander of the forces in lanka.<br /><br />vikrama was hugely popular with the army and a shaken kulasekaran had <br />to seek the support of the chera.<br />vikrama lost, and was exiled. but to keep him quiet his daughter was <br />married off to the chera king.<br />the system worked perfectly.<br /><br />when kulasekara was murdered by his legitimate son sundara there was <br />some more strife. veera pandya his illegitimate son took on sundara <br />chased him out and ruled madurai for quite some years.<br /><br />sundara met malik when malik had already crossed hoysala territory.( <br />thiruvannamalai?) it is assumed by many that sundara went all the way <br />to delhi to request help which is now considered wrong.<br /><br />after the first defeat by muslims vikrama pandya came back from exile <br />he joined with his grand son the chera king's son and attacked <br />madurai. he was repulsed in a rare show of unity between veera and <br />sundara. then their history becomes obscure.<br /><br />when ulugh( thuklak) came in 1320 he defeats and kills a pandya king <br />called parakrama.most possibly belonged to the next generation.<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Venkatesh,<br />     <br />  That pretty much solves it as to why the pandyas did not go to <br />Sinhalese for help, which was forthcoming when cholas were present.<br />     <br />  Regards<br />  Nanda<br />  <br />  "R.venketesh"  wrote:<br />            <br />  <br />  Hi<br />  <br />  the pandyas were at logger heads with the sinhalas during 1290-1310<br />  <br />  parakrama bahu the sinhala king was in the forest waging a guerilla <br />  battle.<br />  <br />  a group of generals called ariyan chakravattis were ruling the lands <br />  of lanka on behalf of the pandyas.&#40; they later declared <br />independence&#41;<br />  <br />  the sinhalas had great reason to hate the pandyas.<br />  first kulasekharans brother vikrama and his illegitimate son <br />  veerapandiya whipped them in the battlefield.<br />  <br />  the latter&#40; thought to have&#41; taken the most precious treasure of the <br />  sinhalas- buddha&#39;s tooth from the hill fortress of abhaya giri back <br />to <br />  madurai.<br />  <br />  the ransom was peace and parakramabahu came all the way to madurai <br />to <br />  beg for it.<br />  <br />  the second time the tooth was taken away was by the goan portugese <br />in <br />  1610.<br />  <br />  allies or not, malik would have come to madurai anyway. he had <br />fought <br />  tougher battles earlier and this wouldnt have dettered him.<br />  the support of hoysalas and sundara pandya was incidental. infact <br />  because sundara was accompanying malik made veerapandya the pandyan <br />  king run away without offering resistance.<br />  <br />  actually malik being a hindu convert and a eunuch had to have <br />frequent <br />  victories to ensure his position in the delhi court.<br />  <br />  regards<br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Sir,<br />    I beg to differ here, Hoysalas and Chalukyas were always <br />  interferring with someone or the other.
