But pathetically, the Hinduism that <br />we see today is not what it was, as correctly pointed out by Vijay <br />earlier.<br /><br />Personally, I dont see any difference between the Brahman that you <br />stated and the Supreme Being that I quoted, except the language <br />difference. I would say, whatever you name it, if the character of <br />what you call as Brahman matches with that of the Supreme Being that <br />I said, they are all one and the same. Only that, you call it <br />as "energy" and stop there. But when I try to attach a form to it, <br />remember that a form without energy is nothing. So even my <br />visualised God is having all the energy that you stated for the <br />Brahman.<br /><br />This is where the harmony of Hinduism lies. You call the God by all <br />names and yet they all finally point out to only one. And most <br />importantly this God is full of Mercy and is Easy to Attain although <br />He is the Master. More logical definition of God isn't it?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venkat &#40;please if you dont&#39; mind can you drop &#39;Smt&#39; makes me <br />feel old&#41;,<br />  Â <br />  I understand what you say on Thenkalai philosphy and I am no <br />expert on Vaishnavite philosphies myself.

If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />  hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel <br />things <br />  happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these <br />are <br />  just some challenges with that approach.<br />  ============ ======Unquote= ========= ========= ====<br />  <br />  You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />  saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />  encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there <br />are <br />  indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. <br />  <br />  But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism <br />Philosophy <br />  perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief <br />on <br />  Him, is done by Him only. <br />  <br />  Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhavirutth am says,<br />  <br />  naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />  vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, <br />aRindhanan <br />  nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE<br />  <br />  Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />  giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable <br />of <br />  taking it back. So please do not do that&#40;taking away your <br />thoughts&#41; <br />  to me. I know you!!! <br />  <br />  Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />  anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is <br />the <br />  sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.<br />  <br />  The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs <br />that <br />  I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu.. ." and "kaNNanE <br />  kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".<br />  <br />  Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be <br />so <br />  merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as <br />the <br />  Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there <br />would <br />  be no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind about what He can do, considering the <br />  Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.<br />  <br />  This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />  between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />  Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />  different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />  visualisation of the Form &#40;I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means <br />Vishnu <br />  and Maan-Mazhu means Siva&#41; when one tries to fit the God in the <br />  above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then Siva <br />  and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. <br />  <br />  This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,<br />  <br />  thAzh sadaiyum &#40;Siva&#41; nIL mudiyum &#40;Vishnu&#41; oN mazhuvum &#40;Siva&#41; <br />  chakkaramum &#40;Vishnu&#41; sUzh aravum &#40;Siva&#41; pon nANum &#40;Vishnu&#41; <br />thOndRum <br />  mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw <br />everything <br />  as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way. <br />  <br />  Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Dear V Venkat, first of all thank for you raising these <br />questions. <br />  Visualising God as human or non human is essentially the Dwaita <br />and <br />  Adwaita traditiions and how they are different. <br />    Â <br />    Let us face it, as young people everyone has a need to visualise <br />  God as human. It is impossible for a young and perhaps spiritually <br />  immature mind to conceptualise a God that is all pervading, spirit <br />  form without a body. We call him super human to differentiate as <br />you <br />  nicely put from a &#39;stupid human&#39;. There are some issues with this <br />  approach. A &#39;super human&#39; is not that different from a human <br />  authority figure to the human mind. Those who have had positive <br />  relationships with authority figures will be fine with this <br />approach <br />  and also with the stance that a &#39;super human&#39; can do what &#39;He&#39; <br />likes <br />  &#40;as Sri Krishna did on many occasion&#41; and I as a human just have <br />to <br />  assume it is His will. That is a great philosphy as long as I am <br />not <br />  subject to one of those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe <br />lose <br />  a child or anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn <br />to <br />  great hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has <br />cruel <br />  things happen cannot believe<br />    in a personal God many people do but these are just some <br />  challenges with that approach.<br />    Â <br />    The adwaitic spirit based God is just the all pervading spirit <br />  that is in all and of all - the spirit does not have a human <br />  personality and it is a great mystery if It has a mind or a will <br />  that works like human minds and human wills. The great part of <br />this <br />  belief system is that the spirit is experiential via <br />dyana/mediation <br />  and so much and those who have tasted that cannot possibly forget <br />  it. The spirit approach is one that makes sense to atheists who <br />  practice meditation and lot of agnostics too who are confused <br />either <br />  way.<br />    Â <br />    Just a small practical attempt to explain. There are many <br />  appraoches that mix both of these too.<br />    <br />    Â <br />    More later,<br />    Â <br />    Malathi<br />    --- On Thu, 8/21/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  <br />  wrote: <br />    <br />    From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Date: Thursday, August 21, 2008, 3:58 AM<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Dear Sivaraman,<br />    <br />    Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />    definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />  asked <br />    you the below question is different. Well, without making you <br />wait <br />    let me say what I wanted to say.<br />    <br />    There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />  form <br />    that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am <br />sure <br />    there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. <br />    <br />    The pAsuram goes like this &#40;I had already quoted this some time <br />  back&#41;<br />    <br />    thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />    thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />    evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />    avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.<br />    <br />    Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may <br />not <br />    know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />  Him, <br />    He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls <br />Him, <br />  He <br />    accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted <br />  into, <br />    He takes that form.<br />    <br />    So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising <br />Him <br />    as a human. <br />    <br />    But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is <br />just <br />    one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is <br />the <br />    Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some <br />&#40;sorry <br />  to <br />    say this, but&#41; stupid human. <br />    <br />    NammAzhwAr says.....<br />    <br />    paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.<br />    <br />    Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />    this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />  is <br />    called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />  visvAsam <br />    is the meaning for this "paRRu".<br />    <br />    So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely <br />nothing <br />    wrong in visualising Him in any form. <br />    <br />    Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram <br />or <br />    Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />  behind <br />    it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />  dish.<br />    <br />    Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum <br />veRRilai, <br />    parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />  says <br />    that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there <br />anything <br />    inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences <br />by <br />    way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />    created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for <br />Him.<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Sivaram Kannan" <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      I apologize if I had offended someone with the statement.<br />      <br />      My sister&#39;s point was, thinking human form as the highest form <br />of<br />      evolution, when describing the supreme being, humans made god <br />a <br />    look<br />      alike of human form.<br />      <br />      regards,<br />      siva.<br />      <br />      On Thu, Aug 21, 2008 at 2:53 AM, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />       wrote: <br />        Dear Sivaraman,<br />       <br />        So what would that mean?

			<div class="content">Dear <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>,<br /><br />Am entering the forum after quite some time, and really enjoying <br />your post. Great...<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vinjamoor_venkatesh" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Sathish,<br />  <br />  Very valid questions. Just my two cents worth regarding the <br />reason, <br />  why Mahabali, inspite of being flawlessly virtuous, was pushed <br />  underground by Vishnu. This is a slightly confusing concept. We <br />need <br />  to see this carefully. <br />  <br />  Caveat: The reasoning that I am giving is based on the philosophy <br />of <br />  Thenkalai Sriaishnavites. I am not imposing my answer on others. <br />  Just an explanation based on one of the various perspectives of <br />the <br />  same happening.<br />  <br />  According to the Thenkalai Srivaishnavites, it is considered that <br />  all the actions are done by God Himself. Well, placing our beliefs <br />  on Karma theory, it will be difficult for many of us to accept <br />this. <br />  I was thinking in the same vein, until, I found a logic in it. &#40;In <br />  fact I had asked that question to all as to how do you expect your <br />  God to be is with this logic in mind. So details of the logic, <br />  later&#41; <br />  <br />  Nammazhwar says, <br />  1. OtthAr mikkArai ilayAya mA mAyan.<br />  2. eedum eduppum il Isan<br />  <br />  and many more such verses confirming that there is none equal to <br />or <br />  above Him. Now who can question someone for an action. Only if <br />that <br />  person is either equal or superior to the person being questioned. <br />  Isnt it? In this case as it is clear that there is none above Him, <br />  then who can question his acts? This aspect is called <br />  the "Parathvam" &#40;meaning : being Supreme to everything and <br />everyone&#41;.<br />  <br />  -- Now logically, such a being will always have Unfettered <br />  Independence to act, as there is no one equal to and above Him. <br />  -- Again logically, such a being will be THE Master of the <br />Universe <br />  &#40;the true He-man&#41;<br />  -- When we say He is the Master of the Universe, then He naturally <br />  owns everything. So what we think of as ours, is not our actually, <br />  but His. This is what we say "what did WE bring when we were born, <br />  that we can carry it back when we are gone". <br />  <br />  Now with that prelude about the Philosophy, coming to Mahabali <br />  episode, Vishnu was very much pleased with Mahabali. Mahabali had <br />  all the best qualities in him. But there was a slight arrogance in <br />  him, when he said "I" will give you what ever you want. <br />  That "Ahankaram" was what a small blemish on his part for which <br />  Vishnu wanted to teach him a lesson. Hence He transformed Himself <br />  from a dwarf to limitless height and made Mahabali realise his <br />  fault. That is when Mahabali Surrenders at His feet and asks Him <br />to <br />  clean him &#40;Mahabali&#41; of the blemish of Arrogance. And Vishnu, puts <br />  his Lotus Feet on Mahabali&#39;s head and pushes him underground <br />asking <br />  him to be the ruler of Patala until the next Manvantara, when the <br />  Indra&#39;s post will be passed on to Mahabali. <br />  <br />  So in short that was not a punishment at all. It was the greatest <br />of <br />  the blessings. Again Thirumangai Azhwar beautifully explains this <br />  episode in his Periya Thirumozhi.<br />  <br />  ilagiya nIL mudi mAvalin than peru vELviyil, mANuruvAi muna nAL<br />  salamoDU mAnilam koNdavan.<br />  <br />  mANuru - the dwarf form<br />  salam - Deceive<br />  <br />  Yes Vishnu, indeed deceives Mahabali into getting the boon. But <br />what <br />  is the deception here. Is it just the fact that He first came as a <br />  dwarf and then while measuring took the largest form? No. Not at <br />  all. The answer is very interesting from a Logical Philosophy <br />point <br />  of view. The deception here is....<br />  <br />  As explained above, while actually, He &#40;Vishnu&#41; is the cause of <br />all <br />  the actions in the world, it means that He made Mahabali think <br />that <br />  the world was his &#40;Mahabali&#39;s&#41; while in reality it was His <br />  &#40;Vishnu&#39;s&#41;. This is what is described as the deception. It is also <br />  said that this quality of Vishnu is very virtuous, in that, He is <br />so <br />  simple &#40;Saulabhyam is the word that is used to describe this <br />  attitude. Saulabhyam -  Sulabhan - very simple&#41;.<br />  <br />  So that is the reason, from a Thenkalai Srivaishnvaite <br />philosophical <br />  standpoint, based purely on logic.<br />  <br />  Just remember the song from the film Marupadiyum,...... "nAyagan <br />  mElirundhu nUlinai AttugindrAn, nAmellAm bommai endru nAdagam <br />  kAttugindrAn.." <br />  <br />  and the very famous song in the movie Karnan sung by our dearest <br />  Sirgazhi Govindarajan <br />  <br />  "kaNNanE kAttinan, kaNNanE sAttinAn, kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear N Venkat, thanks for pointing out the errors. Yes Janemejaya was Arjuna's great grandson, not grandson. And Vaishampayana was Vyasa's disciple, not grandson.

			<div class="content">Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came to<br />India and started documenting everything, the mode of education in<br />India was by sishya parampara. Guru teaches the sishya, sishya has to<br />memorize it, upside down,downside up and what not. In veda's we call<br />it gana padam.....repeating everything in the reverse order. Even<br />today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathula ezhupi ketalum theriyanum.<br /><br />That was the quality of education we had and if that was the case,<br />just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years where the<br />human mind would have been more clear to remember things. So 3 degrees<br />of narration and errors...I dont think that crept in....then we would<br />have lost almost all the veda's and upanishads by now. <br /><br />Kanchi mahaperiyaval says that,we started forgeting things only after<br />documenting them. If there is no documents, we will strive to<br />remember, if we have a book, we will lazy thinking, ok i have the<br />book, I can refer to it anytime, but we will never refer. Thats why<br />the people who knew sanskrit and veda's have come down drastically in<br />just a century, whereas our forefathers have preserved for eons together.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was related by<br />his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna&#39;s grandson Janamejaya in the</div></blockquote>great 'sarpa yagna'.

We do see many people <br />  saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />  encounter such tragedies in their life.

I know you!!! <br />  <br />  Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />  anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is the <br />  sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.<br />  <br />  The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs that <br />  I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE <br />  kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".<br />  <br />  Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />  merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as the <br />  Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there would <br />  be no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind about what He can do, considering the <br />  Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.<br />  <br />  This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />  between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />  Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />  different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />  visualisation of the Form &#40;I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means Vishnu <br />  and Maan-Mazhu means Siva&#41; when one tries to fit the God in the <br />  above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then Siva <br />  and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. <br />  <br />  This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,<br />  <br />  thAzh sadaiyum &#40;Siva&#41; nIL mudiyum &#40;Vishnu&#41; oN mazhuvum &#40;Siva&#41; <br />  chakkaramum &#40;Vishnu&#41; sUzh aravum &#40;Siva&#41; pon nANum &#40;Vishnu&#41; thOndRum <br />  mAL.

			<div class="content">I am no expert like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>, Ravi et al.<br /><br />Just trying to put forth what I understand.<br /><br />The first step of bondage of the self is to think that we are not<br />free. The atman is free and till we recognize it we are caught in the<br />samsara sagaram. This is because we attribute every action to 'I',<br />thinking that I am doing this, I am doing that. This 'I' is the cause<br />of Karma. Once we relinquish this 'I' and do our duty, then we are not<br />bound by karma. Very difficult to realize and attain this and trying<br />to do things without expecting results is the first step of karmayoga.<br /><br />Easiest way is bakthi yoga, where we surrender to the God saying<br />everything is yours, whatever I do is because of you. When we come to<br />this state,as <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> referred as 'willing slaves', then we dont take<br />responsibility of our actions, and slowly the 'I' in us will be<br />dissolved and we can be free. Till then, yes, there is no free will<br />but the struggle of life is only to be free.<br /><br />There is nothing called wrong or right in this world. There is only<br />'sathya', and if we say someone is doing a mistake, it means that they<br />are moving from a lower truth to higher truth to attain the ultimate<br />truth. So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, nothing<br />is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate sathya.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "atpu555"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear V.Venkat,<br />  I followed your recent discussion with interest and thanks for your <br />  expalnations. ay I ask a question on the following sections: <br />  <br />    But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism Philosophy <br />    perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief on <br />    Him, is done by Him only. <br />  ................<br />    Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />    merciful, can even do bad things.
