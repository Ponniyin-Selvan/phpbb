			<div class="content">Rahul,<br /><br />I think great people all have their faults and one would find many "greats"<br />who all let down their own families - Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi, Bharathiyar,<br />etc etc. I suppose if one were to ask Buddha's wife and son (Rahul<br />incidentally <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />), their views about his greatness might be mixed. So I<br />suppose there is always a trade-off: A "great"'s ultimate effect on humanity<br />vs his/her effect on immediate family members. You can add many to that<br />list. Meerabai (we would consider a woman who leaves her husband, thinks she<br />is married to a deity in a temple, mad - these days); Ramana Maharishi - his<br />mother would probably not have been very pleased etc etc <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 12/13/06, Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi;<br />    We are discussing his<br />  poems as are many others in India and abroad &#40;the NRI&#39;s are one of our<br />  greatest assets&#41;.

School books<br />  have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid learns his poems<br />  during the all important childhood even though they are not too inclined to<br />  teach the meanings of those beautiful lines.

What else do you think we ought to do for a poet?<br />  There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been disrespectful of<br />  this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our hands to ensure that<br />  these poems dont fade away with this generation but continue to inspire more<br />  generations of patriots and lovers.<br /> <br />  Remember for all of Bharathi&#39;s greatness as a poet he was a bad father and<br />  dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have admired his<br />  poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be earning? I know his<br />  priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why did he marry?!<br />  Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had commited suicide and<br />  Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn&#39;t have been discussin him!!

			<div class="content">On the topic of 'greats' being criticised by their family, well said <br />Arun.<br /><br />And Sivaram's and SPS's mail about vivekananda - Vivekananda took <br />sanyasa, when his father had died, family was in debts, starving for <br />one meal a day etc. When his father was alive, Vivekanada's family <br />lived like kings. So his family will say that he deceived them and <br />left them in 'nadu theru'. <br /><br />For the matter of fact, I have heard that Chellama Bharathi was not <br />like the chellamma portrayed in the movie Bharathi. She used to enjoy <br />his poems and Bharathi used to read all his poesm first to her. They <br />did share a good family life. Poverty - paramparai sothu of pulavars.<br /><br />Harikrishnan of Marabilakkiyam, author of 'Anuman - Varpum Vanappum, a <br />well know tamil literary person in teh internet world, can talk for <br />hours on Bharathi. GOod discussion on this topic can be found in <br />the 'marabilakkiya' yahoo group.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>
