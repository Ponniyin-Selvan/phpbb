			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />You all know how the Thanjai Mupperum Vizha went on from the Press<br />release and <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="../../www.varalaaru.com/index.html">http://www.varalaaru.com</a><!-- w -->, mails from our team members etc. I<br />wanted to write about my experience about the Two day trip to the<br />group all these days, but was held up with my work so much that I<br />could not find time. Initially I thought, anyway Varalaaru team will<br />write a payanakkatturai and so didnt think about it seriously. But<br />Gokul was encouraging me to write a first hand report which might be<br />followed by a Payanakkatturai by the varalaaru team. So thought I<br />will force myself to find time today to finish this task.<br /><br />After waving Good bye to the Varalaaru team on 25th(I think I wrote<br />about this earlier) for the trip, Shankaran and I were in constant<br />touch with them as to know about their whereabouts. We both were<br />fuming(literally) when we heard that they visited Gangai Konda<br />Cholapuram. It is one of the few places which I was dreaming for<br />long, to visit.<br /><br />On Firday, the most awaited 28th evening, at 9.30 Shankarn, Sriram<br />(Ram and Lavanyas friend) and I met at the Tambaram station and<br />waited for the Train. The train started late by around 45 mins and we<br />all reached Kumbakkonam around 8.00 in the morning. Kamal,Gokul and<br />his brother were waiting for us. They picked us and dropped at a<br />house, which they said belongs to SPS's son. We should be thankful to<br />SPS for making arrangements to make available the key to the locked<br />house where we could freshen up and start for the tour. Dropping us<br />there Gokul and Kamal went to their hotel to get ready. The entire<br />team,Kamal, Gokul,his brother,Lavanya, Kriupa,Sasi,Ram came back in<br />the van to pick us up. We all went to 'Mami's mess' for Breakfast.<br />Excellent tiffin which we all relished, at unbelievable rates..After<br />finishing the Breakfast, Krupa's punch dialogue came,by which we all<br />were spell bound-"naan rendu moonu mani neram kooda saapdama<br />eruppene"...-:)<br /><br />Balaji picked up Dr.Kudavoil Balu from Thanjai and joined us at<br />Kumbakkonam. It was fornuate for our entire team, especially the<br />first timers, that Dr.KV came as a guide for us. We were thrilled.<br />First he took us to Sarangapani temple and explained about<br />the 'karanas' in the raja gopuram. We spent nearly an hour there<br />listening to his lecture. Then he took us Ramaswamy temple where he<br />narrated the beautiful sotry of how and who constructed that temple.<br />A movie can be made out of that fascinating history of the<br />Vijayanagara emperors.<br /><br />Leaving Kumbakkonam, he took us to Patteeswaram and explained about<br />the art and architecture there. He was very much upset when he told<br />us that some beautiful nayak period paintings in the ceiling of the<br />goupram were erased by Sandblasting in the name of renovation. He<br />said those beautiful pictures are in his photos alone and even a<br />trace of them has not been left there. After touring Patteswaram<br />temple, he took us to 'Aaraivadathali', another padal petra<br />sthalam, and said the lingam there is one the most beautiful one, he<br />has ever seen. When we entered the temple we were shell shocked see<br />it dilapated condition. Dr.Kv said this is 100 times better than how<br />it was 5 years back, when he found it. He said the sourrounding<br />peopel were using that temple as toilet and the numerous lingams in<br />the temple premisis were being used to tie buffalows and cows. On his<br />request, on noble soul(I forgot that persons name) came forward to<br />build a compound wall around so that encroachments can be avoided. it<br />was a beautiful temple and the lingam was very beautiful.<br /><br />Then we all went to Panchavanmadevi Pallipadai. Again, that temple<br />also was in a very worst condition. Dr.KV said, he brought some<br />students and history lovers to repair the entrance mandapam of that<br />temple. Dr.KV said there are two shool of thought - one is that this<br />pallipadaid is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s wife Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and another is<br />that this is <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym>'s wife Panchavanmadevi pallipadai. Dr.KV<br />substantiated with his own proofs that it was <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s wife<br />Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and not <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym>'s wife as told by others. He<br />shows architectural proofs for this as well as quoted other<br />kalvettu's substantiating this point. He also showed the long<br />kalvettu, where the word 'Pallipadia' has been intentionally damaged<br />but still the word could be read with the impression. We all left<br />that place without a desire to do so.<br /><br />In the mean time, Mr.Seetharaman, SPS's subordinate joined us who was<br />very much helpful through the rest of the trip. We all went to a<br />hotel for lunch and relaxed a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. After Lunch Dr.KV said he has some<br />work in his office and after finishing it will join us again at<br />Kandiyur. We also went back to our nest's to pack up and headed<br />towards Kandiyur and roamed around the temple there. Around 5.30<br />Dr.KV joined us again and took us to a place which was a thennan<br />thoppu. We travelled taking twists and turns as if going through a<br />maze. He showed us hundreds of siva lingams in two three temples<br />there on the way all of same size and shape. Then we all sat in the<br />tennan thoppu to listen to Dr.Kv's lecture. He narrated a historical<br />story about a place called Nandipuram which was of great importance<br />during Pallavas, Cholas and then Pandiyas, which had a 'Aaayiran<br />thali' which was destroyed by Malik Kafoor. After narrating the great<br />story, he said, he is convinced that the place where we were sitting<br />should be Nandipuram and if excavations are done we can get lots of<br />proofs in terms of sculptures, palaces etc. Dr.KV said that whereever<br />they dig the earth, they can find lingams and even they found a very<br />big lingam which could not be taken out by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and hence was<br />reburried. He said this place should have had the aayiram thali,<br />which was very much exciting for us to hear.On the way back SPS<br />joined us and volunteered to drop Lavanya, Sriram and Ram at the<br />Thiruvaiyaru aaradhanai vizha.<br /><br />By then it was very dark and we all headed to Thanjai, thanking Dr.Kv<br />for his time and effort. Such a great person, spending his whole day<br />for some amatures like us, was something great. We all had dinner<br />with Dr.KV and bid good bye to him thanking for his time. We all were<br />tired that after some discussion we went to bed. Later the next<br />morning only heard that Kamal,Gokul,Krupa were working on the web<br />pages to launch varalaaru sirappidhaz online, till 4 in the morning.<br /><br />The next morning all got ready for the mupperum vizha. Sasi and I<br />went in search of a DTP center to take print outs of the varalaaru CD<br />which was to be released that day. Being Sunday no shop was open and<br />at last we found one where we started taking print outs. Half<br />way through the shop person said he is short of A4 size papers, and<br />Sasi and I were very much tensed by then. It was already 10 and the<br />function started near the big temple. One hand we were tensed for<br />missing the beautiful programme, on the other we both were tensed<br />for getting the print outs ready. Later we managed with A5 sheets cut<br />in to A4 size and rushed to the venue at 10.30. By then Kamal and<br />Gokul were quite tensed as we didnt arrive on time. I think I need<br />not explain about the function as much of it had been already<br />discussed by SPS and article is being published in varalaaru.<br /><br />We(the first timers) got the great oppurtunity to meet Dr.KK,<br />Dr.Rajavelu of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and other prominent people. After lunch, on our<br />request Dr.Rajavelu agreed to take us inside the prohibited area of<br />the big temple. We were very much fortunate enought to visit those<br />places which normal people can never dream of. After relishing the<br />splendour of the big temple and having a great time talking with<br />Dr.KK, Dr.Rajavelu etc. we winded up our tour with a sense of<br />happiness and a urge to learn more of history.<br /><br />Thanks to the varalaaru team who organized the entire thing very<br />smoothly. It was a lovely experience which cant be expressed in<br />words.Hope to have many more trips in the future and hope the members<br />grow in size everytime.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - As the mail was typed during different time period of the day,<br />amidst my work load,their might be some mistakes, lacks continuity<br />etc.(I didnt read it again).So kindly excuse for any mistakes and<br />omissions.</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Satish<br />Late vandhalum Latesta Vandeenga!!!!<br />that was a beautiful report of a great event<br />Fantastic Information Report!!<br />Thanks<br />Sri<br /><br />SatishKumar Arunachalam  wrote:<br /><br />Dear All,<br /><br />You all know how the Thanjai Mupperum Vizha went on from the Press<br />release and <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="../../www.varalaaru.com/index.html">http://www.varalaaru.com</a><!-- w -->, mails from our team members etc. I<br />wanted to write about my experience about the Two day trip to the<br />group all these days, but was held up with my work so much that I<br />could not find time. Initially I thought, anyway Varalaaru team will<br />write a payanakkatturai and so didnt think about it seriously. But<br />Gokul was encouraging me to write a first hand report which might be<br />followed by a Payanakkatturai by the varalaaru team. So thought I<br />will force myself to find time today to finish this task.<br /><br />After waving Good bye to the Varalaaru team on 25th(I think I wrote<br />about this earlier) for the trip, Shankaran and I were in constant<br />touch with them as to know about their whereabouts. We both were<br />fuming(literally) when we heard that they visited Gangai Konda<br />Cholapuram. It is one of the few places which I was dreaming for<br />long, to visit.<br /><br />On Firday, the most awaited 28th evening, at 9.30 Shankarn, Sriram<br />(Ram and Lavanyas friend) and I met at the Tambaram station and<br />waited for the Train. The train started late by around 45 mins and we<br />all reached Kumbakkonam around 8.00 in the morning. Kamal,Gokul and<br />his brother were waiting for us. They picked us and dropped at a<br />house, which they said belongs to SPS's son. We should be thankful to<br />SPS for making arrangements to make available the key to the locked<br />house where we could freshen up and start for the tour. Dropping us<br />there Gokul and Kamal went to their hotel to get ready. The entire<br />team,Kamal, Gokul,his brother,Lavanya, Kriupa,Sasi,Ram came back in<br />the van to pick us up. We all went to 'Mami's mess' for Breakfast.<br />Excellent tiffin which we all relished, at unbelievable rates..After<br />finishing the Breakfast, Krupa's punch dialogue came,by which we all<br />were spell bound-"naan rendu moonu mani neram kooda saapdama<br />eruppene"...-:)<br /><br />Balaji picked up Dr.Kudavoil Balu from Thanjai and joined us at<br />Kumbakkonam. It was fornuate for our entire team, especially the<br />first timers, that Dr.KV came as a guide for us. We were thrilled.<br />First he took us to Sarangapani temple and explained about<br />the 'karanas' in the raja gopuram. We spent nearly an hour there<br />listening to his lecture. Then he took us Ramaswamy temple where he<br />narrated the beautiful sotry of how and who constructed that temple.<br />A movie can be made out of that fascinating history of the<br />Vijayanagara emperors.<br /><br />Leaving Kumbakkonam, he took us to Patteeswaram and explained about<br />the art and architecture there. He was very much upset when he told<br />us that some beautiful nayak period paintings in the ceiling of the<br />goupram were erased by Sandblasting in the name of renovation. He<br />said those beautiful pictures are in his photos alone and even a<br />trace of them has not been left there. After touring Patteswaram<br />temple, he took us to 'Aaraivadathali', another padal petra<br />sthalam, and said the lingam there is one the most beautiful one, he<br />has ever seen. When we entered the temple we were shell shocked see<br />it dilapated condition. Dr.Kv said this is 100 times better than how<br />it was 5 years back, when he found it. He said the sourrounding<br />peopel were using that temple as toilet and the numerous lingams in<br />the temple premisis were being used to tie buffalows and cows. On his<br />request, on noble soul(I forgot that persons name) came forward to<br />build a compound wall around so that encroachments can be avoided. it<br />was a beautiful temple and the lingam was very beautiful.<br /><br />Then we all went to Panchavanmadevi Pallipadai. Again, that temple<br />also was in a very worst condition. Dr.KV said, he brought some<br />students and history lovers to repair the entrance mandapam of that<br />temple. Dr.KV said there are two shool of thought - one is that this<br />pallipadaid is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s wife Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and another is<br />that this is <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym>'s wife Panchavanmadevi pallipadai. Dr.KV<br />substantiated with his own proofs that it was <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s wife<br />Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and not <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym>'s wife as told by others. He<br />shows architectural proofs for this as well as quoted other<br />kalvettu's substantiating this point. He also showed the long<br />kalvettu, where the word 'Pallipadia' has been intentionally damaged<br />but still the word could be read with the impression. We all left<br />that place without a desire to do so.<br /><br />In the mean time, Mr.Seetharaman, SPS's subordinate joined us who was<br />very much helpful through the rest of the trip. We all went to a<br />hotel for lunch and relaxed a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. After Lunch Dr.KV said he has some<br />work in his office and after finishing it will join us again at<br />Kandiyur. We also went back to our nest's to pack up and headed<br />towards Kandiyur and roamed around the temple there. Around 5.30<br />Dr.KV joined us again and took us to a place which was a thennan<br />thoppu. We travelled taking twists and turns as if going through a<br />maze. He showed us hundreds of siva lingams in two three temples<br />there on the way all of same size and shape. Then we all sat in the<br />tennan thoppu to listen to Dr.Kv's lecture. He narrated a historical<br />story about a place called Nandipuram which was of great importance<br />during Pallavas, Cholas and then Pandiyas, which had a 'Aaayiran<br />thali' which was destroyed by Malik Kafoor. After narrating the great<br />story, he said, he is convinced that the place where we were sitting<br />should be Nandipuram and if excavations are done we can get lots of<br />proofs in terms of sculptures, palaces etc. Dr.KV said that whereever<br />they dig the earth, they can find lingams and even they found a very<br />big lingam which could not be taken out by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and hence was<br />reburried. He said this place should have had the aayiram thali,<br />which was very much exciting for us to hear.On the way back SPS<br />joined us and volunteered to drop Lavanya, Sriram and Ram at the<br />Thiruvaiyaru aaradhanai vizha.<br /><br />By then it was very dark and we all headed to Thanjai, thanking Dr.Kv<br />for his time and effort. Such a great person, spending his whole day<br />for some amatures like us, was something great. We all had dinner<br />with Dr.KV and bid good bye to him thanking for his time. We all were<br />tired that after some discussion we went to bed. Later the next<br />morning only heard that Kamal,Gokul,Krupa were working on the web<br />pages to launch varalaaru sirappidhaz online, till 4 in the morning.<br /><br />The next morning all got ready for the mupperum vizha. Sasi and I<br />went in search of a DTP center to take print outs of the varalaaru CD<br />which was to be released that day. Being Sunday no shop was open and<br />at last we found one where we started taking print outs. Half<br />way through the shop person said he is short of A4 size papers, and<br />Sasi and I were very much tensed by then. It was already 10 and the<br />function started near the big temple. One hand we were tensed for<br />missing the beautiful programme, on the other we both were tensed<br />for getting the print outs ready. Later we managed with A5 sheets cut<br />in to A4 size and rushed to the venue at 10.30. By then Kamal and<br />Gokul were quite tensed as we didnt arrive on time. I think I need<br />not explain about the function as much of it had been already<br />discussed by SPS and article is being published in varalaaru.<br /><br />We(the first timers) got the great oppurtunity to meet Dr.KK,<br />Dr.Rajavelu of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and other prominent people. After lunch, on our<br />request Dr.Rajavelu agreed to take us inside the prohibited area of<br />the big temple. We were very much fortunate enought to visit those<br />places which normal people can never dream of. After relishing the<br />splendour of the big temple and having a great time talking with<br />Dr.KK, Dr.Rajavelu etc. we winded up our tour with a sense of<br />happiness and a urge to learn more of history.<br /><br />Thanks to the varalaaru team who organized the entire thing very<br />smoothly. It was a lovely experience which cant be expressed in<br />words.Hope to have many more trips in the future and hope the members<br />grow in size everytime.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - As the mail was typed during different time period of the day,<br />amidst my work load,their might be some mistakes, lacks continuity<br />etc.(I didnt read it again).So kindly excuse for any mistakes and<br />omissions.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!
