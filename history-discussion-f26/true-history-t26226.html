All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. which <br />itself needs authentification ..<br /><br />1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />Century.<br /><br />Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />cdertain dedtails. <br /><br />I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th Century ) <br />and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar period <br />(same 7th / 8 th Century).<br /><br />There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related to <br />traditions, literature and religion ..<br /><br />Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure to <br />several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />discussed widely and what is the reality..<br /><br />To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years back <br />(some examples ):: <br /><br />1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..<br /><br />2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />believed..<br /><br />3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it is <br />(Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />facing..<br /><br />4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology learnt <br />through Jain sculptures !! )<br /><br />And advised us to look for True History ...<br /><br />and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!<br /><br />That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..<br /><br />Re BOGHAR, our Dear Member VIJAY has already posted certain details <br />in our Group earlier.<br />anbudan / sps<br /><br />======================  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote:          <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/index.htm">http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />  The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />  spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />  traditions of Asia. Since then it has grown to become one of <br />India&#39;s <br />  premier indological research and publication institutes.<br />  <br />  Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />  Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian Philosophy, <br />  named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to China <br />in <br />  the 8th century AD and started the Ch&#39;an &#40;Japanese Zen&#41; school of <br />  Mahayana Buddhism.<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    could all this be true<br />    <br />    Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. Kalangi <br />    Nathar was from Benaras.<br />    <br />    Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />  China <br />    he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />  China <br />    was the successor of Kalangi Nathar&#40;Confucius&#41;.<br />    <br />    <br />    Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar &#40;a mystic, yogi&#41;. He <br />  was <br />    said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />    circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />was <br />  a <br />    South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, who <br />    became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />    Bogar&#39;s Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />    preparations to his disciple Pullippani &#40;so named as he is <br />  believed <br />    to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger&#41; and at <br />every <br />    stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />  have <br />    been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.<br />    <br />    It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />  proceeded <br />    to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />  journey <br />    is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />    demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />the <br />    aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />steam <br />    engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />demonstrated <br />  by <br />    Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.<br />    <br />    Bogar&#39;s guru, KÃ„ÂlÃ„Ângi NÃ„Âthar, is believed to be a Chinese who <br />    attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />the <br />    Eighteen Siddhars.<br />    <br />    Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism &#40;5th century B.C.&#41; was the first <br />    Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />  Yang <br />    and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of Shiva -<br /> <br />    Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />  first <br />    revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />old <br />    as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />  Also <br />    alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />  and <br />    was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />    enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by the <br />    Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />existing <br />    Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir Refined <br />  in <br />    Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.<br />    <br />    The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />and <br />    the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />the <br />    same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went under <br />  the <br />    name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi Sriramadevar, <br />  who <br />    was known as Yacob in Arabia.<br />    <br />    This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />of <br />    duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />  alchemy <br />    as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />  after <br />    Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />the <br />    emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />    been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />by <br />    centuries.<br />    <br />    Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />will <br />    suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />    used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these <br />9 <br />    poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />  Master <br />    Medicine &#40; One medicine to cure all disease &#41;. Thirumoolar also <br />    discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />With <br />    the consultation of Agasthiar &#40; Father of Ayurvedic Medicine&#41; <br />and <br />    other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons &#40; Nava Bashanam &#41; and <br />  made <br />    the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />currently <br />    worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />    Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />  mixed <br />    the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.<br />    <br />    Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />    panchamirtham &#40; a sweet recipe &#41; poured on the idol, one can <br />  extract <br />    the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />  becomes <br />    medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />  Navabashana <br />    idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />    abishegam &#40; pouring milk on the idol &#41; and panchamirtha <br />abishegam <br />  &#40; <br />    pouring panchamirtham on the idol &#41;.<br />    <br />    His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />  Murugan <br />    pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />  samadhi <br />    stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />    Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />    Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />  Murugan <br />    Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />  entrance <br />    to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />this <br />    great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />seen <br />  by <br />    his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />top <br />    of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />    overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />    popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />by <br />    sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />    private temple.<br />    <br />    During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />handed <br />    over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />    descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />  right <br />    by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />    annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />    arrow which symbolises Subramanya&#39;s victory over asuras.

Some claim Daruma <br />Bodhidharma <br />      &#40;Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma&#41; was the third child of the <br />      Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. <br />      <br />      The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />    would <br />      make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia in <br />      general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />      Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />have <br />    been <br />      discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />  Matsuda <br />      Ryuchi. <br />      <br />      Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before <br />  they <br />      became two of the very first Shaolin monksÃ¢Â€Â¦quot;years before <br />the <br />    arrival <br />      of Bodhidharma.The TaishÃ…Â TripiÃ¡Â¹Â¦amp;shy;aka documents <br />Sengchou&#39;s skill <br />    with <br />      the tin staff.<br />      <br />      Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />    intellectual <br />      and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary for <br />      enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />  proved <br />      highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen <br />    their <br />      way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />      oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in the <br />    12th <br />      century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma&#39;s <br />focus <br />    was <br />      so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his <br />  legs <br />      atrophied<br />     <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />           <br />  <br />  <br />  With best wishes<br />    <br />  <br />         <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  Once upon a time there was 1 GB storage in your inbox.

			<div class="content">Hello SPS Sir,<br />I am totally accepting your views. My path is also learn true history<br />, but it is very very very small scale compared to yours. I loved<br />history from my school. Have distinction of being in top .2% of <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym><br />exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never had habit of reading<br />books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail fowards.<br />I had gone across certain sources that Murugan and Skanda might be<br />different gods earlier. In search for this, accidentally this year in<br />January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />The book made me realise the following things: <br />the richness of Tamil Sangam and following literatures.<br />And mainly the need for critical study.<br /><br />Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in critical study I saw<br />various hypothesis and interpretation of different scholars...rather a<br />survey first and the author examining each work and telling his<br />comments and putting forward his idea if he had...in way leaving the<br />reader make use his brain and think which should be right based on<br />various arguments...<br /><br />After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki's . Which ever area  <br />I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography in Smile of Murugan<br />and started applying the books in inter library loan.<br /><br />We should be indebted to works of A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for the simplicity of<br />his language. Any common reader can understand what he says. <br /><br />One thing I have to say in this regard is(though some people might not<br />accept it)..there is some sort of bias knowingly or unknowingly among<br />the Indian Historians when it comes to religion and esp Tamil/Sanskrit<br />timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand which<br />when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is totally<br />unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.<br /><br />Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that is<br />questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if it<br />means somebody says 'people of your caste are murders'...its<br />offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our eyes<br />we r not going to get the truth.<br /><br />True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />obstruct and stop it.<br /><br />I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But this is what I feel<br />about True History. Unless and until people leave out their emotions<br />and prejudicial notions true history is very hard to come.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Vairam<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br />   <br />    The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />    "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />    establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of things,he<br />    denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the aagamas,he<br />    condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable <br />  opponent<br />    of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He ignores the<br />    division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />  against<br />    relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />    established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were left<br />    out of Saiva canonical literature."<br />    <br />    And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of <br />  Tamil<br />    Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by its<br />    forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms that <br />  prigs<br />    will call vulgar or obsene"<br />    <br />    And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may be considered as a<br />    landmark in the history of Tamil thought and writing."<br />  ===============================================  <br />  Dear Vairam, <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  DR.

Kalangi <br />      Nathar was from Benaras.<br />      <br />      Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />    China <br />      he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />    China <br />      was the successor of Kalangi Nathar&#40;Confucius&#41;.<br />      <br />      <br />      Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar &#40;a mystic, yogi&#41;. He <br />    was <br />      said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />      circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />  was <br />    a <br />      South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, who <br />      became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />      Bogar&#39;s Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />      preparations to his disciple Pullippani &#40;so named as he is <br />    believed <br />      to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger&#41; and at <br />  every <br />      stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />    have <br />      been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.<br />      <br />      It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />    proceeded <br />      to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />    journey <br />      is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />      demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />  the <br />      aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />  steam <br />      engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />  demonstrated <br />    by <br />      Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.<br />      <br />      Bogar&#39;s guru, KÃ„ÂlÃ„Ângi NÃ„Âthar, is believed to be a Chinese who <br />      attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />  the <br />      Eighteen Siddhars.<br />      <br />      Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism &#40;5th century B.C.&#41; was the first <br />      Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />    Yang <br />      and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of Shiva -<br />   <br />      Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />    first <br />      revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />  old <br />      as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />    Also <br />      alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />    and <br />      was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />      enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by the <br />      Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />  existing <br />      Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir Refined <br />    in <br />      Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.<br />      <br />      The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />  and <br />      the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />  the <br />      same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went under <br />    the <br />      name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi Sriramadevar, <br />    who <br />      was known as Yacob in Arabia.<br />      <br />      This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />  of <br />      duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />    alchemy <br />      as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />    after <br />      Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />  the <br />      emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />      been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />  by <br />      centuries.<br />      <br />      Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />  will <br />      suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />      used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these <br />  9 <br />      poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />    Master <br />      Medicine &#40; One medicine to cure all disease &#41;. Thirumoolar also <br />      discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />  With <br />      the consultation of Agasthiar &#40; Father of Ayurvedic Medicine&#41; <br />  and <br />      other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons &#40; Nava Bashanam &#41; and <br />    made <br />      the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />  currently <br />      worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />      Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />    mixed <br />      the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.<br />      <br />      Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />      panchamirtham &#40; a sweet recipe &#41; poured on the idol, one can <br />    extract <br />      the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />    becomes <br />      medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />    Navabashana <br />      idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />      abishegam &#40; pouring milk on the idol &#41; and panchamirtha <br />  abishegam <br />    &#40; <br />      pouring panchamirtham on the idol &#41;.<br />      <br />      His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />    samadhi <br />      stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />      Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />      Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />    entrance <br />      to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />  this <br />      great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />  seen <br />    by <br />      his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />  top <br />      of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />      overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />      popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />  by <br />      sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />      private temple.<br />      <br />      During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />  handed <br />      over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />      descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />    right <br />      by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />      annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />      arrow which symbolises Subramanya&#39;s victory over asuras. Right <br />  to <br />    be <br />      buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />    them <br />      so chose.<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />       wrote: <br />       <br />        <br />        Bodhidharma &#40;early 6th century CE&#41; was the Buddhist monk <br />        traditionally credited as founder of Zen.

Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />  historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand <br />which<br />  when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is <br />totally<br />  unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.<br />  <br />  Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />  emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that <br />is<br />  questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />  only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if <br />it<br />  means somebody says &#39;people of your caste are murders&#39;...its<br />  offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our <br />eyes<br />  we r not going to get the truth.<br />  <br />  True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />  politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />  obstruct and stop it.<br />  <br />  I dont know what is the summary of this mail.

Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi <br />in <br />      China <br />        was the successor of Kalangi Nathar&#40;Confucius&#41;.<br />        <br />        <br />        Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar &#40;a mystic, yogi&#41;. <br />He <br />      was <br />        said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New <br />Age <br />        circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. <br />Bhogar <br />    was <br />      a <br />        South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, <br />who <br />        became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. <br />In <br />        Bogar&#39;s Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />        preparations to his disciple Pullippani &#40;so named as he is <br />      believed <br />        to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger&#41; and at <br />    every <br />        stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani <br />must <br />      have <br />        been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a <br />balaka.<br />        <br />        It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />      proceeded <br />        to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />      journey <br />        is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />        demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction <br />of <br />    the <br />        aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />    steam <br />        engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />    demonstrated <br />      by <br />        Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.<br />        <br />        Bogar&#39;s guru, KÃ„ÂlÃ„Ângi NÃ„Âthar, is believed to be a Chinese <br />who <br />        attained siddhi in South India and thus became included <br />among <br />    the <br />        Eighteen Siddhars.<br />        <br />        Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism &#40;5th century B.C.&#41; was the <br />first <br />        Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the <br />male <br />      Yang <br />        and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of <br />Shiva -<br />     <br />        Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept <br />was <br />      first <br />        revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is <br />as <br />    old <br />        as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 <br />B.C. <br />      Also <br />        alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. <br />135 <br />      and <br />        was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree <br />was <br />        enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by <br />the <br />        Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />    existing <br />        Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir <br />Refined <br />      in <br />        Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.<br />        <br />        The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of <br />matter <br />    and <br />        the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place <br />about <br />    the <br />        same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went <br />under <br />      the <br />        name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi <br />Sriramadevar, <br />      who <br />        was known as Yacob in Arabia.<br />        <br />        This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the <br />concept <br />    of <br />        duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />      alchemy <br />        as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four <br />centuries <br />      after <br />        Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice <br />aher <br />    the <br />        emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy <br />have <br />        been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao <br />Tse <br />    by <br />        centuries.<br />        <br />        Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human <br />beings <br />    will <br />        suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in <br />medicine he <br />        used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing <br />these <br />    9 <br />        poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />      Master <br />        Medicine &#40; One medicine to cure all disease &#41;. Thirumoolar <br />also <br />        discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />    With <br />        the consultation of Agasthiar &#40; Father of Ayurvedic <br />Medicine&#41; <br />    and <br />        other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons &#40; Nava Bashanam &#41; <br />and <br />      made <br />        the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />    currently <br />        worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near <br />Palani <br />        Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were <br />Bogar <br />      mixed <br />        the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.<br />        <br />        Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />        panchamirtham &#40; a sweet recipe &#41; poured on the idol, one can <br />      extract <br />        the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />      becomes <br />        medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />      Navabashana <br />        idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />        abishegam &#40; pouring milk on the idol &#41; and panchamirtha <br />    abishegam <br />      &#40; <br />        pouring panchamirtham on the idol &#41;.<br />        <br />        His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />      samadhi <br />        stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. <br />Bogar <br />        Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. <br />Actually <br />        Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />      entrance <br />        to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship <br />for <br />    this <br />        great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />    seen <br />      by <br />        his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at <br />the <br />    top <br />        of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, <br />has <br />        overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to <br />its <br />        popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after <br />him <br />    by <br />        sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal <br />and <br />        private temple.<br />        <br />        During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />    handed <br />        over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />        descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of <br />this <br />      right <br />        by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to <br />some <br />        annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, <br />the <br />        arrow which symbolises Subramanya&#39;s victory over asuras. <br />Right <br />    to <br />      be <br />        buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some <br />of <br />      them <br />        so chose.<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          <br />          Bodhidharma &#40;early 6th century CE&#41; was the Buddhist monk <br />          traditionally credited as founder of Zen.

I think the most interesting issues seem<br />to turn up in the Champa context, where there existed a very peculiar<br />amalgam of Tantric Saiva and Buddhist religion, but little has been<br />written about the Chams and most of that is in French, [snip]<br />There are some interesting links with the Pallavas, which you might<br />find pertinent. [...]"<br /><br />A quick list is appended at the end from my biblio-notes which you <br />may<br />find interesting.<br /><br />Kings and Gods are seen as one in many of S. Indian art: <br />Example 1) In the Chola painting (early 11th century) in Tanjore<br />temple, (long thought to be lost, but rediscovered by S. K.<br />Govindasamy of Annamalai univ., Chidambaram in 1930s) a youthful<br />majestic man with an aged munivar is seen. This, many authors claim<br />(eg., Nagasamy, or Jim Heitzman's book on Cholas (OUP) cover photo)<br />as Rajaraja I and his guru, KaruvUrt tEvar. BUT, this is only<br />part of the story. There are a total of 4 men standing (3 aged, one<br />young)! and a little far, there is Dakshinamurti sitting like<br />Ayyappan/Ayyanar with a yoga-paTTai. Dakshinamurti image is badly<br />damaged, For a sketch see C. Sivaramamurti, monumental Nataraja book.<br />Evidently, the devaraja concept is working here. Among the four <br />rishis<br />worshipping Dakshinamurti, (sanaka- aadi munivar), only sanatkumAran<br />is portrayed as young, and the rest are elderly rishis. The beautiful<br />idea is used by the master Chola painters: sanatkumAran-sanaka; also<br />simultaneously Rajarajan-KaruvUrttevar!<br />[I do not think anybody has described this info anywhere].<br /><br />Dakshinamurti was present only in the old Tamizakam (= today's <br />Kearala<br />and TN, here I use tamizakam in the sense of Prof. P. Schalk's<br />publications). The Dakshinamurti in the Potiyil mountains is seen as<br />Avalokitesvara in Buddhist gaNDavyUhasUtram. There is a long and<br />ancient tradition among Saivaites that Tamil was taught by Shiva to<br />Agastya Malayamuni and among Tamil Buddhists that it was Avalokita <br />who<br />taught Tamil to Agastya at Potiyil. This earlier myth spills over <br />into<br />Sanskrit legends produced in the south that made Shaivaites claim <br />that<br />Shiva taught Sanskrit to Panini, and Buddhists on the contrary went <br />to<br />claim that it was really Avalokita who inspired Panini. Differing <br />from<br />M. Deshpande, Who inspired Panini?, JAOS paper (Nortwest<br />India/Afghanistan area was said to be the orgin of the Panini myths),<br />I wrote about South and the key role of Potiyil(Malaya/Potalaka)<br />in the creation of these legends about Panini and parallel ones for<br />Agastya. (1998 postings under the thread title: Where was PANini<br />inspired?)<br /><br />Between Pandyan Madurai and Pallava/Cholan Chidambaram royal<br />competitions, the Dakshinamurti myth has played a major role. See<br />Dr. Palaniappan's essay from the Indology website: <br /><br />a) Madurai and Chidambaram: <br />The Tamil Cities that Created Important Sanskrit Myths<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-patanjali.html">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/p ... njali.html</a><!-- m --><br />b) Parvata, potiyil, and zrI-parvata<br />Some remarks by S.

Anient Tamil texts<br />explicitly locate Parvatam as Potiyil(malayam), for example, in<br />Takkayaakap paraNi.<br /><br />In the second millennium CE, Dakshinamurti travels North.<br />Abhivagupta's teacher praises him as Dakshinamurti, and<br />AdvaitavAdins use the DakshiNaamUrti theme.<br /><br />Example 2: <br />-----------<br /><br />I have already given an example of painting exhibiting Devaraja<br />phenomenon. Next is sculpture. Rajaraja I's famous and powerful son,<br />Rajendra Chozhan I has carved a big and beautuful relief sculpture at<br />GangaikoNDachOzapuram. This displays the ChaNDesa nAyanAr, who stays<br />outside all the Shiva sanctums in India and who cut his father down<br />with his axe. Shiva appears in the scene to revive the dead father,<br />and garlands the young ChaNDesar with his favorite flower garland <br />made<br />of ko_nRai flowers. In the Chola panel, Shiva, seated with Parvati, <br />is<br />seen garlanding the ChaNDesa Nayanar worshipping and thanking for the<br />highest honor that Shiva bestows. Here, ChaNDesar's face is said to <br />be<br />modeled after Rajendran I. (See his portrait sculpture in Gautam<br />Sarabhai collection). Again Devaraja concept: ChaNDesar/Rajendran.<br />Well, sort of.<br /><br />S. Indian kings portrayed themselves only as Rishis/Nayanars etc.,<br />But Khmer kings went overboard and portrayed themslves as Vishnu, ...<br />Also, the famous "Smiling God" imagery seen in gopura towers of<br />Cambodia, has early precedents in Tamil literature and art.<br />[Will write on this some other time.]<br /><br />I am almost positive that if successor states (like Vijayanagar,<br />Nayaks, Marathas) followed the earlier lead of seafaring in<br />sangam literature, and then Pallavas and Cholas built up<br />the Naval forces, India would not have been subdued by<br />Europe later.<br /><br />Regards,<br />N.

			<div class="content">My two cents in this regard -<br />1 Is the historian (or anyone ) having inherent<br />bias/negativity and making generalistic comments on<br />some section of people or is he/she really<br />dispassionate? Calling all believers fools is a biased<br />negative stance, discusssing a poet's stance many<br />years ago is not negative, it is an objective view of<br />what that poet did, personally I find nothing<br />offensive in that at all.<br /><br />2 I think we discussed this in the 'all Gods are one'<br />thread, or something related. There is a context to<br />what all poets/prophets/everyone says. When Jesus said<br />'I am the way' he meant spirituality as the single way<br />to liberation, it was his way of saying it as the<br />world was not so small in those days. What this poet<br />said about brahmins similarly is based on his<br />experience about some people who mis treated him and<br />others like him, not all - the times he lived in it<br />might have seemed like 'all'.<br /><br />3 Lastly on self examination. What is our ties to this<br />'caste' related label and why? Is a software engineer<br />who knows two words of sanskrit somewhere really the<br />'brahmin' referred to in poems and scriptures? Is he<br />learned/qualified and in the same lines have the same<br />biases as they did? Probably not. Then what is there<br />to take offence? Personally to me nothing (I can<br />understand however others sensitivity in this regard<br />perhaps).<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br /><br />--- vinjamoor_venkatesh<br /> wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam,<br /> <br />    Next thing that is major problem to readers of<br />  history is that<br />    emotions, when have fixed notions on certain<br />  issues and when that<br />  is<br />    questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to<br />  be true...<br />    only when we are open to thoughts we can get real<br />  history..even if<br />  it<br />    means somebody says &#39;people of your caste are<br />  murders&#39;...its<br />    offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in<br />  it...if we close our<br />  eyes<br />    we r not going to get the truth.<br />   <br />    True history can be found but it can never be<br />  discussed! ...<br />    politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are<br />  so many people to<br />    obstruct and stop it.<br /> <br /> <br />  Very Right and Correct observations.

My path is<br />  also learn true<br />  history<br />    , but it is very very very small scale compared to<br />  yours. I loved<br />    history from my school. Have distinction of being<br />  in top .2% of<br />  <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym><br />    exam writers in my 10th in History.

In search for this,<br />  accidentally this year<br />  in<br />    January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />    The book made me realise the following things: <br />    the richness of Tamil Sangam and following<br />  literatures.<br />    And mainly the need for critical study.<br />   <br />    Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in<br />  critical study I saw<br />    various hypothesis and interpretation of different<br /> <br />  scholars...rather a<br />    survey first and the author examining each work<br />  and telling his<br />    comments and putting forward his idea if he<br />  had...in way leaving<br />  the<br />    reader make use his brain and think which should<br />  be right based on<br />    various arguments...<br />   <br />    After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki&#39;s<br />  . Which ever<br />  area<br />    I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography<br />  in Smile of<br />  Murugan<br />    and started applying the books in inter library<br />  loan.<br />   <br />    We should be indebted to works of<br />  A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />    Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />    Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for<br />  the simplicity of<br />    his language. Any common reader can understand<br />  what he says.<br />   <br />    One thing I have to say in this regard is&#40;though<br />  some people might<br />  not<br />    accept it&#41;..there is some sort of bias knowingly<br />  or unknowingly<br />  among<br />    the Indian Historians when it comes to religion<br />  and esp<br />  Tamil/Sanskrit<br />    timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one<br />  of the greatest<br />    historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was<br />  the magic wand<br />  which<br />    when hit the southern proto language created<br />  Tamil, which is<br />  totally<br />    unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and<br />  its history.<br />   <br />    Next thing that is major problem to readers of<br />  history is that<br />    emotions, when have fixed notions on certain<br />  issues and when that<br />  is<br />    questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to<br />  be true...<br />    only when we are open to thoughts we can get real<br />  history..even if<br />  it<br />    means somebody says &#39;people of your caste are<br />  murders&#39;...its<br />    offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in<br />  it...if we close our<br />  eyes<br />    we r not going to get the truth.<br />   <br />    True history can be found but it can never be<br />  discussed! ...<br />    politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are<br />  so many people to<br />    obstruct and stop it.<br />   <br />    I dont know what is the summary of this mail.

Unless and until people leave<br />  out their<br />  emotions<br />    and prejudicial notions true history is very hard<br />  to come.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Vairam<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Sivapathasekaran"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"<br />   wrote: <br />       <br />        The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />        "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels<br />  against the hindu<br />        establishment,particularly against the<br />  brahminic order of<br />  things,he<br />        denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas<br />  and the<br />  aagamas,he<br />        condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He<br />  is implacable<br />      opponent<br />        of caste system.He is against all forms of<br />  orthodoxy.He<br />  ignores the<br />        division between the Saivites and<br />  Vaishnavites.Such rebellion<br />      against<br />        relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was<br />  simply ignored by the<br />        established tradition,and his poems,numbering<br />  527 stanzas,were<br />  left<br />        out of Saiva canonical literature."<br />       <br />        And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram<br />  from A history of<br />      Tamil<br />        Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking<br />  us sometimes by<br />  its<br />        forthright directness;he is not even afraid of<br />  using terms<br />  that<br />      prigs<br />        will call vulgar or obsene"<br />       <br />        And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may<br />  be considered<br />  as a<br />        landmark in the history of Tamil thought and<br />  writing."<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote></div>

All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. <br />which <br />  itself needs authentification ..<br />  <br />  1.

Nothing prior to 10th <br />  Century.<br />  <br />  Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />  cdertain dedtails. <br />  <br />  I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />  VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period &#40;8th Century &#41; <br />  and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar <br />period <br />  &#40;same 7th / 8 th Century&#41;.<br />  <br />  There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related to <br />  traditions, literature and religion ..<br />  <br />  Dr. Kalaikkovan &#40;and Dr. Nalini&#41; - by virtue of their exposure to <br />  several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />  discussed widely and what is the reality..<br />  <br />  To emlighten &#40;history&#41; infants like me, they revealed 5 years back <br />  &#40;some examples &#41;:: <br />  <br />  1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..<br />  <br />  2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />  believed..<br />  <br />  3.

Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />  believed &#40;even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />  this&#41;.. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. &#40; with the technology learnt <br />  through Jain sculptures !! &#41;<br />  <br />  And advised us to look for True History ...<br />  <br />  and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!<br />  <br />  That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia &#40;Source Authorless - but <br />  collective and subjected to editing &#41; in discussions ..<br />  <br />  Re BOGHAR, our Dear Member VIJAY has already posted certain details <br />  in our Group earlier.<br />  anbudan / sps<br />  <br />  ======================  <br />    "Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote:          <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/index.htm">http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/index.htm</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />    The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />    spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />    traditions of Asia.

Kalangi <br />      Nathar was from Benaras.<br />      <br />      Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />    China <br />      he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />    China <br />      was the successor of Kalangi Nathar&#40;Confucius&#41;.<br />      <br />      <br />      Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar &#40;a mystic, yogi&#41;. He <br />    was <br />      said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />      circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />  was <br />    a <br />      South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, <br />who <br />      became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />      Bogar&#39;s Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />      preparations to his disciple Pullippani &#40;so named as he is <br />    believed <br />      to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger&#41; and at <br />  every <br />      stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />    have <br />      been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.<br />      <br />      It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />    proceeded <br />      to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />    journey <br />      is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />      demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />  the <br />      aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />  steam <br />      engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />  demonstrated <br />    by <br />      Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.<br />      <br />      Bogar&#39;s guru, KÃ„ÂlÃ„Ângi NÃ„Âthar, is believed to be a Chinese <br />who <br />      attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />  the <br />      Eighteen Siddhars.<br />      <br />      Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism &#40;5th century B.C.&#41; was the <br />first <br />      Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />    Yang <br />      and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of <br />Shiva -<br />   <br />      Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />    first <br />      revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />  old <br />      as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />    Also <br />      alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />    and <br />      was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />      enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by <br />the <br />      Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />  existing <br />      Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir <br />Refined <br />    in <br />      Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.<br />      <br />      The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />  and <br />      the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />  the <br />      same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went <br />under <br />    the <br />      name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi <br />Sriramadevar, <br />    who <br />      was known as Yacob in Arabia.<br />      <br />      This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />  of <br />      duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />    alchemy <br />      as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />    after <br />      Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />  the <br />      emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy <br />have <br />      been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />  by <br />      centuries.<br />      <br />      Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />  will <br />      suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine <br />he <br />      used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing <br />these <br />  9 <br />      poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />    Master <br />      Medicine &#40; One medicine to cure all disease &#41;. Thirumoolar also <br />      discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />  With <br />      the consultation of Agasthiar &#40; Father of Ayurvedic Medicine&#41; <br />  and <br />      other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons &#40; Nava Bashanam &#41; and <br />    made <br />      the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />  currently <br />      worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near <br />Palani <br />      Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />    mixed <br />      the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.<br />      <br />      Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />      panchamirtham &#40; a sweet recipe &#41; poured on the idol, one can <br />    extract <br />      the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />    becomes <br />      medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />    Navabashana <br />      idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />      abishegam &#40; pouring milk on the idol &#41; and panchamirtha <br />  abishegam <br />    &#40; <br />      pouring panchamirtham on the idol &#41;.<br />      <br />      His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />    samadhi <br />      stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />      Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. <br />Actually <br />      Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />    entrance <br />      to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />  this <br />      great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />  seen <br />    by <br />      his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />  top <br />      of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />      overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />      popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />  by <br />      sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />      private temple.<br />      <br />      During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />  handed <br />      over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />      descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />    right <br />      by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />      annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />      arrow which symbolises Subramanya&#39;s victory over asuras. Right <br />  to <br />    be <br />      buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />    them <br />      so chose.<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />       wrote: <br />       <br />        <br />        Bodhidharma &#40;early 6th century CE&#41; was the Buddhist monk <br />        traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />    contemporary <br />        biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />    subsequent <br />        accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree <br />    that <br />      he <br />        was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />        subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />  Bodhidharma <br />        &#40;Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma&#41; was the third child of the <br />        Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. <br />        <br />        The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />      would <br />        make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia <br />in <br />        general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />        Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />  have <br />      been <br />        discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />    Matsuda <br />        Ryuchi. <br />        <br />        Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before <br />    they <br />        became two of the very first Shaolin monksÃ¢Â€Â¦quot;years <br />before <br />  the <br />      arrival <br />        of Bodhidharma.The TaishÃ…Â TripiÃ¡Â¹Â¦amp;shy;aka documents <br />  Sengchou&#39;s skill <br />      with <br />        the tin staff.<br />        <br />        Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />      intellectual <br />        and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary <br />for <br />        enlightenment.

			<div class="content">I have not read the history or the book 'Smile of Murugan', but I <br />have written in one thread that Skanda, Karthikeya and Muruga are <br />different.<br />It is not a authentic 'copy book' view, but something that is derived <br />out of religious texts. <br />Facts can become myths over period of time, we cannot figure out <br />facts for myths. <br />Raja rajan can be a myth after 20,000 years from now.<br />Well, if Ishvaku is one, why not <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> ?<br /><br />-- R<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hello SPS Sir,<br />  I am totally accepting your views. My path is also learn true <br />history<br />  , but it is very very very small scale compared to yours. I loved<br />  history from my school. Have distinction of being in top .2% of <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym><br />  exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never had habit of reading<br />  books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail fowards.<br />  I had gone across certain sources that Murugan and Skanda might be<br />  different gods earlier. In search for this, accidentally this year <br />in<br />  January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />  The book made me realise the following things: <br />  the richness of Tamil Sangam and following literatures.<br />  And mainly the need for critical study.<br />  <br />  Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in critical study I saw<br />  various hypothesis and interpretation of different <br />scholars...rather a<br />  survey first and the author examining each work and telling his<br />  comments and putting forward his idea if he had...in way leaving the<br />  reader make use his brain and think which should be right based on<br />  various arguments...<br />  <br />  After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki&#39;s . Which ever <br />area  <br />  I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography in Smile of <br />Murugan<br />  and started applying the books in inter library loan.<br />  <br />  We should be indebted to works of A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />  Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />  Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for the simplicity of<br />  his language. Any common reader can understand what he says. <br />  <br />  One thing I have to say in this regard is&#40;though some people might <br />not<br />  accept it&#41;..there is some sort of bias knowingly or unknowingly <br />among<br />  the Indian Historians when it comes to religion and esp <br />Tamil/Sanskrit<br />  timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />  historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand <br />which<br />  when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is totally<br />  unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.<br />  <br />  Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />  emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that is<br />  questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />  only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if <br />it<br />  means somebody says &#39;people of your caste are murders&#39;...its<br />  offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our <br />eyes<br />  we r not going to get the truth.<br />  <br />  True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />  politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />  obstruct and stop it.<br />  <br />  I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But this is what I <br />feel<br />  about True History. Unless and until people leave out their emotions<br />  and prejudicial notions true history is very hard to come.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Vairam<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br />     <br />      The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />      "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />      establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of <br />things,he<br />      denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the aagamas,he<br />      condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable <br />    opponent<br />      of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He ignores <br />the<br />      division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />    against<br />      relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />      established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were <br />left<br />      out of Saiva canonical literature."<br />      <br />      And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of <br />    Tamil<br />      Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by <br />its<br />      forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms that <br />    prigs<br />      will call vulgar or obsene"<br />      <br />      And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may be considered as <br />a<br />      landmark in the history of Tamil thought and writing."<br />    ===============================================  <br />    Dear Vairam, <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    DR.

This very same concept <br />was <br />      first <br />        revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is <br />as <br />    old <br />        as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 <br />B.C. <br />      Also <br />        alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. <br />135 <br />      and <br />        was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree <br />was <br />        enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by <br />the <br />        Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />    existing <br />        Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir <br />Refined <br />      in <br />        Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.<br />        <br />        The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />    and <br />        the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />    the <br />        same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went <br />under <br />      the <br />        name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi <br />Sriramadevar, <br />      who <br />        was known as Yacob in Arabia.<br />        <br />        This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the <br />concept <br />    of <br />        duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />      alchemy <br />        as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />      after <br />        Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />    the <br />        emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy <br />have <br />        been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao <br />Tse <br />    by <br />        centuries.<br />        <br />        Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />    will <br />        suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine <br />he <br />        used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing <br />these <br />    9 <br />        poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />      Master <br />        Medicine &#40; One medicine to cure all disease &#41;. Thirumoolar <br />also <br />        discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />    With <br />        the consultation of Agasthiar &#40; Father of Ayurvedic Medicine&#41; <br />    and <br />        other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons &#40; Nava Bashanam &#41; <br />and <br />      made <br />        the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />    currently <br />        worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near <br />Palani <br />        Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />      mixed <br />        the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.<br />        <br />        Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />        panchamirtham &#40; a sweet recipe &#41; poured on the idol, one can <br />      extract <br />        the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />      becomes <br />        medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />      Navabashana <br />        idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />        abishegam &#40; pouring milk on the idol &#41; and panchamirtha <br />    abishegam <br />      &#40; <br />        pouring panchamirtham on the idol &#41;.<br />        <br />        His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />      samadhi <br />        stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />        Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. <br />Actually <br />        Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />      entrance <br />        to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />    this <br />        great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />    seen <br />      by <br />        his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at <br />the <br />    top <br />        of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, <br />has <br />        overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to <br />its <br />        popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after <br />him <br />    by <br />        sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal <br />and <br />        private temple.<br />        <br />        During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />    handed <br />        over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />        descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of <br />this <br />      right <br />        by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to <br />some <br />        annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, <br />the <br />        arrow which symbolises Subramanya&#39;s victory over asuras. <br />Right <br />    to <br />      be <br />        buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some <br />of <br />      them <br />        so chose.<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          <br />          Bodhidharma &#40;early 6th century CE&#41; was the Buddhist monk <br />          traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />      contemporary <br />          biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />      subsequent <br />          accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts <br />agree <br />      that <br />        he <br />          was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />          subsequently relocated northwards.

However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu <br />to <br />          Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />    have <br />        been <br />          discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />      Matsuda <br />          Ryuchi. <br />          <br />          Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts <br />before <br />      they <br />          became two of the very first Shaolin monksÃ¢Â€Â¦quot;years <br />before <br />    the <br />        arrival <br />          of Bodhidharma.The TaishÃ…Â TripiÃ¡Â¹Â¦amp;shy;aka documents <br />    Sengchou&#39;s skill <br />        with <br />          the tin staff.<br />          <br />          Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />        intellectual <br />          and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary <br />for <br />          enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />      proved <br />          highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made <br />Zen <br />        their <br />          way of life, following their encounter with the martial-<br />arts-<br />          oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in <br />the <br />        12th <br />          century.
