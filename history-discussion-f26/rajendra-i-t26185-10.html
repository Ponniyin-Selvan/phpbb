There is a mention of a Tamil-brahmi inscription in<br />    mamandur which is deciphered by Iravatham Mahadeven<br />    and dated as the later part of the 2nd century AD. As<br />    per the timelines, Pallavas does not appear on the<br />    horizon till the middle of the third century AD and<br />    they start using the Tamil-Brahmi right away. Meaning,<br />    the script is already available for usage. But it<br />    would be interesting to see the kind of changes they<br />    introduced. But as per my readings, tamil-brahmi is<br />    what is referred as pallava scripts by the south<br />    eastern historians. I am open to change my view if<br />    there is evidence to the contrary.<br />    <br />    2.My contention is that the merchantile contact with<br />    the south east asia is what is responsible for the<br />    introduction of the script in these areas and Pallavas<br />    has nothing to do with it.<br />    <br />    3. The only known military raid&#40;atleast to me&#41; is by<br />    Rajendra I and by one of his successors which resulted<br />    in more contacts with SE Asia and more intermingling<br />    between the Indian settlers and the natives. This<br />    resulted in the formation of communities with mixed<br />    Hindu/Buddhist heritage and influenced heavily by<br />    Indic culture.<br />    <br />    4.

This is clearly indicated by <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> <br />Sastri <br />    in <br />        his book "History of South India". <br />        <br />        Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one and only <br />    Sun!!! <br />        <br />        I feel <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>&#39;s fame eclipsed Rajendra&#39;s only because, after <br />the <br />        initial invasions to expand the empire, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> concentrated a <br />lot <br />    on <br />        the people welfare and local administration which kept him <br />  amids <br />      the <br />        masses.

			<div class="content">Dear Friends,<br /><br />Forwarding very interesting and informative posting by Dr. Jaybee<br />re Kulothunga I - Vikrama related to SIVAPURI INSCRIPTIONS ..<br /><br />Thank you Dr. jaybee.. regards/ sps<br />============<br /><br />Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2001 21:32:39 +0800<br />Subject: About the Dvarapalaka<br />X-Sender: jaybee@...<br />To:  "agathiyar@yahoogroups.com"<br />Yahoo-Message-Num: 10714<br />===========================<br /><br />Dr. Jaybee wrote:: Dear Friends,<br />=====================<br />I gave up sending the URL and re-uploaded a<br />different file with less KBs. And let the web-site<br />announce itself. Easier that way.<br />Sorry about the nuisance.xxxxxxxx<br />========================<br />This Dvarapalaka is one of a pair. It is<br />four-armed and is almost seven feet in height.<br /><br />I forgot to mention about the fourth arm -<br />the left lower arm which is in the posture of<br />Kunjitha hastham. It points downwards, implying<br />"Bow ye down in supplication before My Lord and Master".<br /><br />This temple is in a territory which lies in<br />the fringe area of the Chola-Pandya border.<br />It formed the centre of a huge Agaram -<br />grant to Brahmins who qualified themselves with the<br />knowledge and recital of the four VEdas. This Agaram<br />was called 'Niruba Sekara ChaturVEda Manggalam'.<br />An Agaram is otherwise known as Brahma DEsam.<br />They always have a title - ChaturVEda Manggalam.<br /><br />The temple was rebuilt during the time of Kulothunga<br />Chola I.<br />This temple is of great historic value because of<br />several rare and unique information that can be gleaned<br />from it.<br />During the time of RajaRaja Chola, the Pandya country<br />was annexed to the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola I's<br />rule, the Pandyas were expelled and made into persona non grata -<br />without any recognition - and simply made into non-entities.<br />Their identity was made non-existant.<br />A new dynasty was formed.<br />The sons of Rajendra Chola were conferred the title of<br />ChOla-PAndya and ruled as the kings in the PAndya country.<br />They went by names like 'Sundara ChOla-PAndya' etc.<br />Every town, village were renamed after the ChOlas.<br />Even irrigation tanks and canals were thus renamed.<br />The Pandya country was renamed 'RAjaRAja PAndya NAdu'.<br />Countries were divided into provinces called 'vaLa nAdu's.<br />These were subdivided into 'nAdu's and 'kURRam's. The<br />next sub-subdivision was 'Ur' and 'GrAmam'.<br />The province of 'KEraLa Singga VaLa NAdu' became<br />'RAjEndra ChOla VaLa NAdu'. 'Niruba SEkara ChadurVEda<br />Manggalam' became 'ChOla MArthANda Chatur VEda Manggalam'.<br />One canal was renamed into 'KarikAl ChOla VAykkAl'. And<br />an irrigation tank came to be called 'Sri Kundhavai<br />PErEri'.<br />This process is known as 'ChOlianisation'.<br /><br />There was a colony of merchants called 'Thisai Ayirathu<br />AinURRuvar'. They had a chief town called AruviyUr'. The<br />merchants of AruviyUr were liberal patrons for this temple.<br />I was able to discover AruviyUr because of the information<br />that I collected from this temple.<br /><br />*I also discovered a class of warriors called 'VALIlAr'-<br />????????. There is a reference to them in an inscription of the<br />12th year of Vikrama ChOla. I traced their descendants who<br />are still around after 800 years. *<br /><br />KulOthunga ChOla I does not belong to the direct<br />lineage of the VijayAlaya line of ChOlas to which RAja RAja<br />or RAjEndra belonged. He was actually a prince of the<br />Eastern Chalukya(Telugu) dyansty. But due to repeated<br />intermarriage with the Imperial ChOlas, he had more ChOla<br />blood in him than Chalukya.<br /><br />But there had been upheavals when and after he came<br />to power. For one thing, the Pandya country became loosened<br />from his grip. Inscriptions belonging to the same time -<br />even engraved by the same sthapathi, are found. Some<br />would bear the name of KulOthungga. But there are others which<br />bear the name of one SriVallabha PAndya. That is to say,<br />the PAndyas had been reinstated.<br />But all the same, KulOthungga maintained many<br />cantonments of the army right upto the Cape Kumari.<br /><br />We also find something sinister taking place during<br />his reign. His feudatories and war-lords meet in the temple<br />and take oaths of allegience with each other. Breaking of the<br />oath was denounced with the severest imprecations and curses.<br />I have come across four such pacts in that temple.<br /><br />The other peculiarity is that, although it is<br />dedicated to ThAnthOnRIswarar - Svayam PrakAshar or Svayambhu<br />Linggam, there is an installed SivaLinggam. What happened<br />to the original Svayambhu? May be I am the only one alive<br />who knows.<br /><br />Another strange thing is that, all the contemporary<br />temples in that territory were destroyed and sacked by<br />the Turks. But this temple was only partially destroyed.<br />Somehow the Turks seem to have abandoned the sacking<br />somewhere along the line. There is a very interesting and<br />strange story behind it.<br /><br />The Nandhi is huge, The Dvarapalakas are huge;<br />but the SivaLinggam is very small.<br /><br />There are also two hidden chambers, one of which was<br />opened by me - much to my future regret.<br />Many a times, I would go to the temple to copy the<br />inscriptions. The GurukkaL would make some Horlicks and<br />leave it with me; and then he would lock the temple from<br />outside during the 'uchchi kAlam'.<br />I would be alone. At certain particular times,<br />I would feel a tingling sensation on the nape of my neck.<br />I would feel something; something creepy. The hair would<br />stand on its end. There will be some loud wind blowing;<br />the trees will be shaking. That will be around mid-day.<br />Most often, I used to hear voices and sounds of<br />people walking around. Sometimes, I had a sensation that<br />somebody or somebodies were watching me closely from<br />behind.<br />Who or what were they?<br />I don't know.<br />Never found out.<br />Never could find out.<br />I never turned back to look.<br />I am not supposed to look back.<br />So I never did.<br />I even found a long hidden valuable inscription by<br />a freak occurance.<br />Even two years ago, I found a freize of GajaSamhara<br />Murthi. It is the smallest that can be found. It was also<br />found unexpectedly.<br />The ChAmundi statue is so full of life that it can<br />enchant you. So is the Amman 'Dharma Samvardhini' or 'ARam<br />VaLartha NAyagi'.<br />Even the jade Sivalinggam for which I do the daily puja,<br />called ThAnthOnRIswarar, came to me under strange circumstances.<br /><br />But this temple which has withstood the onslaughts and<br />vicissitudes, and ravages of time, is now succumbing to vandalism<br />of the first order. It is taking place under the pretext of<br />renovation. Many beautiful edifices have been broken up or<br />smothered with concrete.<br />These present day vandals are worse than Malik kafur<br />or Kusrau Khan or Thuglaq.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />JayBee</div>
