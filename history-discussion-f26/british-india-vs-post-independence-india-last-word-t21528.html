			<div class="content">Dear SPS,<br />Gems as always and the cricket analagy was great..<br /><br />I think we need to draw the curtains on this discussion..after your nice summary<br />But before we finish Again We have to proud yet realistic..<br />The Italians cannot claim the whole of Europe belong to them today as they were under the Roman empire...<br />Not can the Arabs of Egypt declare they are all descendents of the pharoahs..<br />We as indian have evolved we are in a true sence in 1947 the EU...<br />Thats an example which I often tell my peers as soon as they see an asian patient they lok at me...Cant speak Hindi! But Sri you are from India...My response always has been 'good can you speak Greek?' Thats India each of our territoies and states have their own class culture....<br />But the Truth is we lost it in the middle...Truth is we interpreted our scriptures to our own evil designs...and we introduced social evils...A few of them were sorted by our previous colonists...but at the same time they did things which they didnt have to do...<br /><br />French colonies: Vietnam,Combodia....<br />Dutch colonies:Indonesia<br /><br />asking historians to sight Rishimoolam nadhimoolam...interesting so we wont beilive whatever was written by British,we wont believe anything written after British they are all marxists! Who do we beileve??<br /><br />as a doctor I can illustarte the number of genetic disorders which are propagated in the asian communities due to Consanguinity(Inbreeding) and child marraige...<br /><br />Completely out of context...why wasnt Karna not allowed to challange Arjuna if being a Kshathriya was based on valour??<br />Why did Ekaleva have to part with his thumb after being refused admission into the gurukul for Kshathriyas...I havent found the answers....I am still waiting<br /><br />Ravi was quick to criticise Freedom at midnight because it was written by the westerners but I dont think anybody has paid the gretaest tribute to Gandhi as those two did in that book.<br /><br />any way I can go on and on<br /><br />Last REQUEST May I SUGGEST THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT UPLOADED ON TO THE FREEVIEW SITE and SHOULD in the group only..I hope my fellow Moderators agree<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote: Dear Friends,<br /><br />Probably much discussed topic in the recent past.<br /><br />Venkat's mails indicate : <br /><br />1. The British accomplished a Unified India.<br />2. Rulers prior to that - including Mohammedans & contemporary<br />Rajas - were still worse.<br />3. Detailed accounting on Mahatma Gandhi, his accomplishemtns and<br />assassination.<br /><br />Vijay- Veerasamy added : Comparison with Indonesia.<br /><br />It is London based Sridhar's views make me revisit this subject<br />again. His mail is put below for quick reference. I share his views.<br /><br />More or less he has covered all the aspects related to the topic.<br /><br />Sentil Raja's mails - with supporting links - definitely motivate us<br />to look at things from another plane.<br /><br />Satish added certain points.<br /><br />Ravi - emotional has taken certain (extra ) liberties in stressing<br />his view .. He is ardent Arunagiri Bakthar.. and in Business.. Knows<br />how to preseent things in a corum.<br /><br />In School books we have read of : <br />GUPTHAPPERARASU<br />MAGATHAPPERARASu<br /><br />Almost equivalent to this CHOZHAPPERARASU was established and was<br />functioning for about 80/85 years (985 to 1070 )in a span of about<br />400 years.<br /><br />During this period Bhojan and others ruled North. Gazni invasion ..<br />Mohammedan rule almost in the entire India.<br /><br />In-fighting among Rajputs paved way for Mohammedan rule and<br />subsequently the British rule..<br /><br />Same way infighting among Paalaykkarar's (there was hardly any king<br />in Southern India) when the British landed.. and Nawab of Arcot could<br />hardly resist.<br /><br />Anandarangam Pillai's diaries are discussing more of this time..<br /><br />This unification process snow-balled from the North to South.. Recall<br />the Leaders : Except Rajagopalachariar - Sathiamurthy - Kamaraj who<br />else was mentionable (Kodikaatha Kumaran - VOC - Bharathi did not<br />live to see the freedom movement unfying the Nation ).<br /><br />And Mahatma Gandhi was that force which retained that Unification<br />process.. which process could not be retained by any of his followers<br />including Nehruji.<br /><br />Take today's Tamilnadu ? Can we think of voicing anything in singular<br />voice? take this discussion : how many varying views. But Mahatma<br />could achieve this in the entire length and width of the Nation.<br /><br />Molasting the modesty of women or a Nation is common in any War..<br /><br />We have discussed extensively on patriotism earlier.<br /><br />Today Japanese automobiles - Arab Oil - Satellites by Grown nations<br />etc., etc., have become part and parcel of our life..<br /><br />We have been exporting BRAIN to the WEST ..<br /><br />We are seeing the Whites taking Idli - Vada in Kaiyendhibawans in<br />Chennai !<br /><br />Our guys are travelling in Tyoto Corella ..<br /><br />God has never been unkind to us.. and the scars are also getting<br />healed ..<br /><br />Very dense discussion .. I almost share Dr. Sridhar's views ..<br />==============================<br />Lighter side :: <br /><br />Man of the Match : Senthil Raja<br /><br />Man of the Series : Venkat<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Let us keep aside HATTUR inscriptions and Rajendra's 900000 (Nine<br />Lakh ) army looting for some time ..<br /><br />Ponniyin Selvan ...<br />Kalki - who bonded us and provided this platform ..<br /><br />Was NANDHINI - daughter of Veerapandian or his Lover ?<br /><br />sps<br /><br />==================<br /><br />SRIDHAR RATHINAM WROTE :: <br /><br />Dear All<br /><br />I am not swayed one way or the other<br /><br />I am a proud of my country and its ancient heritage at the same time<br />I am not blind to the facts<br />==================================<br />Fact: 1:: look around the world of places colonised by the powers<br />and whats left behind?<br />==================================<br />Persions, Afghans and Mughals ...you dont see much of the ancient<br />hindu heritage in north India...<br /><br />Spanish...The natives were completely wiped out of north and southa<br />merica French ....left the far east in such a state after looting<br />them they are still in the dogs Like wise the French colonies of<br />Africa Germany ....I think we all know our history....Well some<br />believe hitler did it for the better ment of Aryan race...even in<br />india America....<br /><br />I dont deny the fact that the British benefited from Indian wealth<br />initially it was the EIC then it was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> moderated with the<br />Crown....RRC did that 1000 years ago<br /><br />They did not have to reform certain civil inequalities...well Sati,<br />Child marraige and women's right werent social evil in some opinions<br />Ill reserve my opinion on that...They shouldnt have cared to change<br />those they were hear only for the money....<br /><br />OOPs they did that to show how Hindu were barbarians and to convert<br />to Christianity ....Yes like the spaniards converted the whole of goa<br />into catholics...<br /><br /><br />Aparthied and the KKK are good examples and thats because they dont<br />considered coloured as humans at all...If we are proud to consider a<br />fellow indian as not human so we go and clean ourselves...We have to<br />be proud of ourselves...cant argue with that...<br /><br />I dont deny that exists even today...but still people speak out and<br />are outraged I am sure we all know of stephen lawrence case which is<br />still supported by locals...<br /><br />Come on I and vijay can choose the British PM just because i lived<br />in a counytry once ruled by the crown Yes a valid resident of<br />commonwealth has voting rights in England<br /><br />We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even<br />today I get asked ''Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi<br />sakthi??'' Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and<br />yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the<br />dissections...<br /><br />We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till he<br />was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a train in<br />south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />=============<br />Do you know the support he had from the average white man in England<br />because he was changing humanity and people recognised it<br />=============<br />You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man<br /><br />You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem<br />issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the<br />third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French<br />and English history might be different<br /><br />I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight<br />not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them had<br />a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom is<br />virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer so...)<br />one of them was able to make a crown out of it....<br />=================<br />Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the<br />nobels had the right of PrimaNocte...spending the first night with<br />all their subjects was their right.<br />=================<br />Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians who<br />were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all those<br />ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!<br />==================<br />Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he<br />needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in<br />Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because they<br />were victorious but they kept their word.<br /><br />The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in<br />Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened<br /><br />The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two old<br />fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a<br />country already tiorn by a partition...It was the Pakistani Chief of<br />Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.<br /><br />The list is endless.....<br /><br />The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university<br />Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in<br />caves...<br /><br />We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of our<br />own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to<br />blam not them<br /><br />If we accept that with humility we will progress...<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br />==========================<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "viru" <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venkat,<br /> <br />  I have given enough proofs for my points, and please refer to them.<br /> <br />  "We should see history as it is, and NOT As we are"<br /> <br />  If we judge history by our own morals, then it would not be<br />history. but<br />  bunch of facts to be hated by us.<br /> <br />  I feel, you havent countered my arguments, in particular.. rather<br />you<br />  have been replyin in general, that we should accept our wrongs, and<br />  should not hide it under the guise of patriotism..<br /> <br />  I agree.. and we are not hiding any thing.. But, your generic &#40;&<br />  generous&#41; branding of our history as barbarious without british,<br />is not<br />  only offensive, but of highly ill taste.<br /> <br />  I would like to know the morals in which you brand a thing as right<br />&<br />  wrong. Or, on what basis did you term those things as problematic<br />or<br />  barbaric.<br /> <br />  So, the basic question itself is not answered..<br /> <br />  By the way, in your own arguments, that we have to accept our<br />wrongs of<br />  ours.. Agreed.. But shouldn&#39;t we accept the atrocities, and<br />barbaric<br />  activities of the britishers too?<br /> <br />  What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong..<br />but<br />  let&#39;s praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />  wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..<br /> <br />  I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..<br /> <br />  You are so easily terming sati &#40;which is almost voluntary &#41; as<br />barbaric,<br />  and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere<br />historic<br />  incident.<br /> <br />  You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet,<br />the Goa<br />  Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities<br />&#40;like<br />  inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front<br />of<br />  their husband&#41; by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to<br />you..<br /> <br />  You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree<br />the<br />  fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers<br />in<br />  Mumbai and calcutta... &#40;You might feel, the red-light prostitution<br />of<br />  mumbai would be better than devdaasi system&#41;..<br /> <br />  And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />  accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of<br />nun..<br />  &#40;this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women<br />accepted<br />  god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances&#41;..<br />  And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in<br />Europe..<br />  Would you term them as Barbaric? &#40;you may say it happens in<br />europe..<br />  but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also<br />the<br />  fact, that the nuns are produced & misused in india too&#41;<br /> <br /> <br />  So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />  history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />  negatives for our country?<br /> <br />  I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go<br />through<br />  those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />  vague opinionist argument.<br /> <br />  We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you..<br />but<br />  in a term, based on true understanding of india. &#40;we are really<br />  becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />  mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media<br />controlled<br />  still by the colonial rulers&#41;<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Senthil Raja<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    -Hi<br />    everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting<br />    personal or emotional about it.<br />   <br />    that was a long reply and befor vk replies i&#39;ll just like to add<br />    santayana&#39;s statement on history<br />   <br />    &#39;those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"<br />   <br />    just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a<br />    confident indian.<br />    its just hogwash.<br />    the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a<br />    problem.<br />   <br />    we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />    system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them<br />or<br />    placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.<br />   <br />    in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic<br />excesses<br />    in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />    its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />    patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />    i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in<br />his<br />    society and points out to them bravely.<br />   <br />    its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point<br />out.<br />   <br />   <br />    venketesh</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Yahoo!
