			<div class="content">Dear sir,<br />We are all greatly delighted to have your blessed participation our group.<br />Immediately after reading your mail - I thought of asking you about Vijayalaya choleeswaram - but was wondering whether narthamalai was within your territory (I's not sure). I's greatly delighted when I found that it was the cover page of your informative and well laid out website !<br />Also, I'm very much excited that you have done intensive study on Ajanta paintings...<br />May I request you, sir - to write a series on the same - detailing points of interest that are generally missed by a casual observer ? It will very much be within the realm of this group - as Ajantha has special place in Kalki's Sivakamiyin Sabadham.<br />Like pavi and many others, I once again welcome you to this group.<br />I look forward to know more about sudarshanam and your work.<br /><br />Warm regards.<br />S.Gokul<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />"Two roads diverged in a wood and...<br />I took the one less traveled by,<br />and that has made all the difference"<br />- Robert Frost<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />On Thu, 13 Feb 2003 10:06:34<br />Pavithra Srinivasan wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Mr. Swaminathan...<br /> <br /> Thanks a lot for accepting my invitation, sir.

I have been following the Ponniyin<br />  selvan tour.<br />  <br />  I addressed you as young friends for I am old, 62 years. I was a professor<br />  of Mechanical enginnering at <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology">IIT</acronym> Delhi for donkeys years, 34 years to be<br />  precise. I have returned to my native place Pudukkottai. What i am doing<br />  here may interst you. I have set up a centre for arts and culture, called<br />  Sudharsanam. It has two main objectives: one is to ducument the legacy of<br />  Pudukkottai district, make local people understand the importance and help<br />  in the preservation of them. The other is to offer an opportunity to<br />  youngsters to know about our heritage through a residential 4-week summer<br />  course. The centre is a private trust of a philothropist industrialist MR<br />  VK Sundaram.<br />  <br />  I am quite thrilled to see your enthusiasm about our culture. When you find<br />  time visit our website <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pudukkottai.org">http://www.pudukkottai.org</a><!-- w --><br />  <br />  I would be very happy to take you around Pudukkottai. Infact Kodumbalur id<br />  a Ponniyin Selvan location. Care to visit?<br />  <br />  As for myself, I have done a very detailed study of Ajanta paintings. I<br />  have given lectures-slideshows in India and abroad. I also give lectures on<br />  Physics and Aesthetics of Music, An Introduction to Ancient Tamil<br />  Literature, Sound of Sanskrit, and a host of other topics.<br />  <br />  I can explain the activities of Sudharsanam later.

This is the state of affairs in T.Nadu.<br />  <br />   One HAS TO strongly disagree....why?<br />  <br />   You all will be surprised &#40;at least you should be&#41;.<br />  <br />   I am ready to resign my job any moment if only I could get<br />   that "Watchman" post in that that temple &#40;Man, he is being paid<br />   around Rs. 5,000 p/m for a three-day-a-week, two-hours-a-day<br />   job.....I asked the local people&#41;. So, it is not that the T.N Govt.<br />   has neglected that temple, nor did it let any other temple/other<br />   things down. It is just the people, &#40;do not say it again, &#39;people&#39;<br />   means "YOU & I". It does not fit here&#41;.<br />  <br />   If he is not doing his duty means, what shall our govt. do?<br />  <br />    Our people do not realise the greatness of their own heritage.<br />  <br />   Not really. What type of image this will create in the minds of<br />   people who read this statement, especially if he/she is not from T.<br />   Nadu and reading this from Singapore, Sri Lanka, Malasia, etc.? Do<br />   you all really blieve that this government is functioning without any<br />   care for our culture and heritage?<br />  <br />  <br />   People at that place are really concerned about the fate of their<br />   great monuments falling into pieces in front of their own eyes. Most<br />   of them are youth....one can realize if they were there. The feeling<br />   was as if we were some gods coming to rescue their heritage/temple.<br />   Maybe they assumed wrongly seeing us with a movie camera and and<br />   other photographic instruments, but we were giving them a feeling.<br />  <br />   Anbudan,<br />   krupa<br />  <br />  <br />   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br />  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   Your use of Yahoo!

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by S.Swaminathan  using id sswami_99</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear Young Friends<br /><br />It is my pleasure to share your enthusiasm.<br /><br />After my retirement I am busier. So you should excuse me if i am rather brief. Don't get offended.<br /><br />May i request you all to vist the website <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pudukkottai.org">http://www.pudukkottai.org</a><!-- w --> fully and give me your comments. We are three involved in the project full time: Vasudeva Kiran and Murugapandian. The website is the handy work of Murugapandian with assistance from Kiran. There are a number of people helping us.<br /><br />Kodumbalur is associated with Rajaraja Chola. The temple Muvar Koil is one among the greatest temples of India. The other is Vijayalaya Choliswaram inNarthamalai. Both of these are covered in the site. Please look up. So is Sittannavasal, considered to be second in importance to Ajanta in the history of Indian paintings. The site has covered Sittannavasal. <br /><br />Gokul has suggested to write a serial on Ajanta. it is good idea. There area lot of things a casual observer would miss. If fact, with the subdued lighting you will miss most of it unless some knowledgeable person is your guide.<br /><br />I would also like to keep you informed of the activities of my project, which is unique in its concept. I am hoping that you would find interesting. This may result in your helping us by offering ideas and in the execution.<br /><br />I am first giving you a brief introdusction to Sudharsanam our project of setting up centre for arts and culture in Pudukkottai.<br /><br />Let me have your comments and suggestions for improvement. Those who find time please visit us.<br /><br />With best wishes<br />Swaminathan<br /><br />======================<br />Sudharsanam â€“ A Centre for Arts and Culture; Pudukkottai<br /><br /> <br /><br />We the Tamils are the inheritors of a great culture spanning a few millennia. This culture has enriched itself further by assimilating from other cultures. Owing to compulsions of modern life, the present generation gets fewer opportunities for exposure to aspects of our culture. This is particularly true for the people living in towns and cities. Also, due to economic andother reasons large numbers of Tamils have migrated to places outside Tamilnadu and also abroad. The result is that they have lost day-to-day contactwith the elements of our culture. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The migrant Tamils who sincerely love their culture may also be concerned that their offspring are deprived of contact with their own culture since they grow in a different environment, but at the same time are not able to assimilate themselves completely in the said environment. This is owing to the fact they are brought up in a different ambience at home, especially whentheir parents are first-generation migrants. The result is that the younger generation leads a life, which has lost its old roots and has not grown new ones. We have only to see the people of India/Tamil origin now living inMauritius, South Africa, Fiji, etc to understand what happens when a people is cut off for long periods of time from their original roots.<br /><br /> <br /><br />There are many people who may like to have a broad idea of our arts and literature. Also<br /><br />there are many socially conscious people who would like to know more about the historical and artistic significance of their neighbourhood.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Our land is rich in a variety of folk-art, folklore and rural crafts. Many of them are languishing owing to lack of awareness of their importance and want of patronage for the artists and craftsman. Many of these arts and crafts will soon die if no remedial action is taken. It is commented that we Indians lack a sense of history. We have very little information about the people who have contributed to our rich heritage. We have also allowed our heritage sites decay and disappear.<br /><br /> <br /><br />At present there does not appear to be any organisation to offer exposure to our cultural<br /><br />traditions though there is no dearth of institutions in Tamilnadu specialising in different branches of art and literature. It is, hence, felt desirable to start an institution which would in a small way to engage itself in making available to the interested people a basic introduction to our art and culture through well designed awareness-courses consisting of lectures and workshops by scholars, master-artists and craftsmen in the relevant fields. Further, through this institution, it is aimed to contribute in a small way in the documentation of the surviving legacy.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Since the proponents of this venture belong to or are in some way associated with the Pudukkottai area the contemplated organisation will at the initial stage pay special attention to the matters associated with Pudukkottai and its environs. It is hoped that the success of this venture will provide impetus for the founding of similar venture in other parts of the country.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Sudharsanam is being set up by Mr. V.K. Sundaram, an industrialist and educationalist. The team that will be running the centre includes Prof. S. Swaminathan, who, during his career as teacher at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi spanning over three decades, had been attempting integrating arts with technology.

I have been following the Ponniyin <br />  selvan tour.<br />  <br />  I addressed you as young friends for I am old, 62 years. I was a professor <br />  of Mechanical enginnering at <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology">IIT</acronym> Delhi for donkeys years, 34 years to be <br />  precise. I have returned to my native place Pudukkottai. What i am doing <br />  here may interst you. I have set up a centre for arts and culture, called <br />  Sudharsanam. It has two main objectives: one is to ducument the legacy of <br />  Pudukkottai district, make local people understand the importance and help <br />  in the preservation of them. The other is to offer an opportunity to <br />  youngsters to know about our heritage through a residential 4-week summer <br />  course. The centre is a private trust of a philothropist industrialist MR <br />  VK Sundaram.<br />  <br />  I am quite thrilled to see your enthusiasm about our culture. When you find <br />  time visit our website <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pudukkottai.org">http://www.pudukkottai.org</a><!-- w --><br />  <br />  I would be very happy to take you around Pudukkottai. Infact Kodumbalurid <br />  a Ponniyin Selvan location. Care to visit?<br />  <br />  As for myself, I have done a very detailed study of Ajanta paintings. I <br />  have given lectures-slideshows in India and abroad. I also give lectures on <br />  Physics and Aesthetics of Music, An Introduction to Ancient Tamil <br />  Literature, Sound of Sanskrit, and a host of other topics.<br />  <br />  I can explain the activities of Sudharsanam later. Or one of you can vist <br />  us and write a review of the visit.<br />  <br />  I can be reached atsswami@..., Phone at Pudukkottai &#40;Res&#41; <br />  04322-222650; Office 04322-230666; Postal Address: 47, Charles Nagar - II, <br />  Pudukkottai-622005<br />  <br />  Rest later<br />  Swaminathan<br />  <br />  Rest later<br />  Swaminathan<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   ----- Original Message -----<br />   From: S.

This is the state of affairs in T.Nadu.<br />  <br />   One HAS TO strongly disagree....why?<br />  <br />   You all will be surprised &#40;at least you should be&#41;.<br />  <br />   I am ready to resign my job any moment if only I could get<br />   that "Watchman" post in that that temple &#40;Man, he is being paid<br />   around Rs. 5,000 p/m for a three-day-a-week, two-hours-a-day<br />   job.....I asked the local people&#41;. So, it is not that the T.N Govt.<br />   has neglected that temple, nor did it let any other temple/other<br />   things down. It is just the people, &#40;do not say it again, &#39;people&#39;<br />   means "YOU & I". It does not fit here&#41;.<br />  <br />   If he is not doing his duty means, what shall our govt. do?<br />  <br />    Our people do not realise the greatness of their own heritage.<br />  <br />   Not really. What type of image this will create in the minds of<br />   people who read this statement, especially if he/she is not from T.<br />   Nadu and reading this from Singapore, Sri Lanka, Malasia, etc.? Do<br />   you all really blieve that this government is functioning without any<br />   care for our culture and heritage?<br />  <br />  <br />   People at that place are really concerned about the fate of their<br />   great monuments falling into pieces in front of their own eyes. Most<br />   of them are youth....one can realize if they were there. The feeling<br />   was as if we were some gods coming to rescue their heritage/temple.<br />   Maybe they assumed wrongly seeing us with a movie camera and and<br />   other photographic instruments, but we were giving them a feeling.<br />  <br />   Anbudan,<br />   krupa<br />  <br />  <br />   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br />  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   Your use of Yahoo!
