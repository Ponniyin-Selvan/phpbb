			<div class="content">Dear SPs <br />whether i am boring to all.If u mention the topics , according to <br />that i can send messages to all.<br /><br /><br /><br />History is Always Being Rewritten <br /><br />Written by Dr. David Frawley    <br /><br />In recent years, the government of India and several state <br />governments have decided to revise history books, particularly <br />relative to the ancient period, bringing up recent data that calls <br />into question the Aryan invasion and the many theories that have <br />arisen from it. <br /><br />Over the past few decades numerous archaeological finds have been <br />made throughout North India, considerably widening the civilization <br />of the region and uncovering its continuity through time, rendering <br />the Aryan Invasion idea obsolete.<br /><br />History books are always being rewritten and they should be, as new <br />information comes in and our understanding of culture widens.<br /><br />This does not mean that history should carelessly be rewritten to <br />suit an ideology, as in communist Russia or in Nazi Germany, but that <br />we must not turn old accounts of history into an unalterable dogma. <br /><br />History is not a material science like physics that deals with hard <br />facts and even physics textbooks are continually being updated.<br /><br />The European treatment of India was the same as that of America and <br />Africa, starting with the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, who <br />brought the cruel ways of the Inquisition to India. <br /><br />The Indian mutiny of 1857 occurred because the British brought in <br />aggressive and intolerant missionaries and had the country in the <br />grip of a cruel economic exploitation. Yet such oppression has been <br />left out of the history of India as told by the Europeans and <br />independent India has not rewritten the record adequately. <br /><br />Yet can one seriously imagineÂ—given all the colonial distortions of <br />history worldwide which are only slowly being removed todayÂ—that no <br />real revision of the history of India needs to be made? Can we <br />believe that somehow by luck, in spite of their prejudices, that <br />colonial and European scholars got the history of India right and <br />wrote it without any distortion or bias in their favor, though they <br />failed everywhere else?<br /><br />When ancient historical finds are made in China, as with the <br />uncovering of the tomb of the first emperor dating to the third <br />century BCE, there is great national pride even among the communists. <br />But all the massive finds of the Harappan/Sarasvati culture, as well <br />as the retracing of the once great Sarasvati River, bring no pride to <br />the leftist-secular intellectuals of India.<br /><br />They would ignore these, dismiss them as an invention of Hindu <br />communalists, or imagine that they represent an unknown civilization <br />that vanished mysteriously with no real connection to the later <br />traditions of the region! Though the Vedic literature is the largest <br />of the ancient world by all accounts, Indian leftists will have no <br />pride in it and seek to denigrate it as best they can. <br /><br />Though the Mahabharata at over two thousand years old is the world's <br />oldest and longest national epic, Indian leftists don't even want it <br />taught in the schools (even when the common people find great pride <br />in watching the Mahabharata on television).<br /><br />Actually the distortion of history has been done intentionally by <br />many modern Indian historians, particularly covering over historical <br />wrongs against Hindus. They believe that by correcting history that <br />the present can be changed. They pretend that the generally cruel <br />Muslim rule in India was benign and secular so that this account will <br />serve to make modern Hindus and Muslims more benign and secular and <br />help them bury the past.<br /><br /> <br />India has not faced its past in order not to offend minorities in the <br />country, who may not resonate with the older Hindu and Buddhist <br />cultures of the country.<br /><br />It has also been intentionally done in order to prevent the majority <br />community from awakening from its colonial and religious oppression, <br />fearing this would increase communal disharmony, even though <br />distortions caused by this, like the image of Hindus as backward <br />idolaters, continue in the world media today. <br /><br />The result is that the country lacks a genuine national pride and a <br />sense of its continuity to ancient times.<br /><br />History and National Pride<br /><br />One of the main purposes of history books, as taught in different <br />countries in the world, is to instill a sense of national pride and <br />honor. Whether it is the United States, Great Britain, Russia, <br />Germany or China, this is certainly the case today and has been so as <br />long as these countries have existed as modern nations.<br /><br />The lives of great leaders, particularly the founders of the country <br />are highlighted, the continuity of the nation's history is <br />emphasized, and the importance of the nation in the history of the <br />world and the greatness of the national culture are stressed. <br />Students are expected to come away from reading accounts of their <br />history with a sense of national greatness and purpose, not only for <br />the past but also for the future.<br /> <br />However, India is a strange and unique country in which history books <br />are often anti-national in nature. India has largely kept in tact the <br />British approach to Indian history devised in the colonial era. <br /><br />History books in India try to ignore the dominant Hindu ethos of the <br />country and its history before the Islamic period. India's greatest <br />historical and cultural document, the Mahabharata, is hardly given <br />any attention in the schools. So too, the Vedas, Ramayana, Puranas, <br />Buddhist Jatakas and other prime historical and cultural documents of <br />the country are ignored because of their religious overtones. If they <br />do address India as a nation, it is only India of the independence <br />movement that they acknowledge, as if prior to 1947 India did not <br />really exist. <br /><br />While Nehru is made important, older kings from the Rig Vedic <br />Bharatas to Yudishthira of the Mahabharata period to the Marathas of <br />the eighteenth century are hardly mentioned. There is no real sense <br />of any historical continuity to the culture, much less to the country.<br /><br />While Mahatma Gandhi is emphasized, the greater spiritual traditions <br />of India and its great teachers from the Vedic rishis, Vedantic, <br />Buddhist and Jain sages to modern savants like Sri Aurobindo and <br />Ramana Maharshi is not given much attention.<br /><br />It is true that history should not be a mere instrument of a <br />destructive nationalism and should avoid instilling aggression <br />against other lands and peoples, even when upholding what is valuable <br />in a nation's history. But this does not require that the national <br />value of historical studies is negated altogether.<br /><br /><br />The question, therefore, is how the history accounts in India can be <br />made to reflect and instill a genuine nationalism and sense of the <br />country's history and destiny. <br /><br />India, after all, is one of the great civilizations of the world, <br />with cultural traditions that have much value for humanity. Such <br />historical accounts must reflect the richness and diversity of Indic <br />civilization, but they cannot ignore its unity and continuity either.<br /><br /><br />The fact is that you cannot build a nation without creating history <br />books that instill a positive nationalism, particularly in the youth. <br /><br />The real danger in India is not the arising of a chauvinistic <br />nationalism like that of Nazi Germany or Fascist ItalyÂ—which are <br />foreign to the mentality and ethos of the countryÂ—but a lack of <br />national spirit and historical consciousness that keeps people <br />alienated from their roots and the country divided. <br /><br /><br />India needs a real national spirit and for this a national sense of <br />history, pride and purpose is required. A true Indian nationalism <br />will be rooted in an Indian ethos of dharma, spirituality and <br />pluralism, but this does not mean there can be no national or <br />historical pride without encouraging communalism in the country.<br /><br />On the contrary, a greater sense of national identity would be the <br />best thing to counter the disintegrating influence of religious, <br />castist and regional interests that are bringing the country down.<br /><br /><br />Therefore we must ask: Why can't Indians connect India's traditional <br />ancient literature, the Vedas, with its archaeology through Harappa <br />and the many Sarasvati river sites? Why can't Indians find national <br />pride in their own history both on literary and archaeological <br />levels? Why should history in India be used for national shame, <br />rather than national pride? Why should the history of India place <br />Indic civilization out of India? These are questions that must be <br />answered.<br /><br />The subject of history in the western context is a very different <br />than in the Indian context. In the western view, history is mainly an <br />account of political events and economic progress, a purely outward <br />affair. <br /><br />In the Hindu view, history is a means of teaching detachment, showing <br />how great kings and kingdoms come and go in the course of time. It <br />has an inner value as a spiritual teaching about the nature of human <br />life and the need for liberation from worldly concerns. In the <br />western view, history is progressive from the crude beginnings of <br />agriculture and village life moving forward to the present day urban <br />culture. In the Hindu view, history is cyclical, with various <br />cultures coming and going over time as the soul seeks liberation from <br />the phenomenal world.<br /><br />The western progressive account of history is quite flawed. For <br />example, the first civilizations of the ancient world that we can <br />documentÂ—including Egypt, Sumeria, India and ChinaÂ—did not regard <br />themselves as the first but were aware of many cultures and kingdoms <br />before them, particularly prior to a great flood. The civilizations <br />that we regard as the first saw themselves as very old with many <br />antecedents! Yet we pretend that there was nothing before them! In <br />addition, the civilizations of the Third Millennium BCE, like those <br />of Egypt and Harappan/Sarasvati India, had better urban and <br />architectural achievements than those that followed for many <br />centuries. Even Europe had its Dark Ages after the Roman period in <br />which much knowledge was lost. This idea of history as linear <br />progress is clearly not the case. While humanity has progressed <br />scientifically, this is mainly over the past five hundred years. On <br />the other hand, we see a spiritual decline since ancient times, and <br />over the last century we can note a decline in culture, art, music <br />and philosophy in Europe itself, coinciding or even caused by great <br />advances in science.<br /><br />As India is the only civilization of antiquity to survive the <br />onslaught of time, it is the special responsibility of Indians to <br />discover not only their history but also that of the entire ancient <br />world. Just as there are unquestioned distortions of ancient India, <br />similar distortions of other ancient cultures also exist. . Revamping <br />the way history is taught in Indian schools would be a major step in <br />the direction of a more authentic and spiritual sensitive history of <br />the world. It is a scientific and spiritual imperative, not only for <br />India but for all countries.</div>

Yet such oppression has been<br />left out of the history of India as told by the Europeans and<br />independent India has not rewritten the record adequately.<br /><br />Yet can one seriously imagine?given all the colonial distortions of<br />history worldwide which are only slowly being removed today?that no<br />real revision of the history of India needs to be made? Can we<br />believe that somehow by luck, in spite of their prejudices, that<br />colonial and European scholars got the history of India right and<br />wrote it without any distortion or bias in their favor, though they<br />failed everywhere else?<br /><br />When ancient historical finds are made in China, as with the<br />uncovering of the tomb of the first emperor dating to the third<br />century BCE, there is great national pride even among the communists.<br />But all the massive finds of the Harappan/Sarasvati culture, as well<br />as the retracing of the once great Sarasvati River, bring no pride to<br />the leftist-secular intellectuals of India.<br /><br />They would ignore these, dismiss them as an invention of Hindu<br />communalists, or imagine that they represent an unknown civilization<br />that vanished mysteriously with no real connection to the later<br />traditions of the region! Though the Vedic literature is the largest<br />of the ancient world by all accounts, Indian leftists will have no<br />pride in it and seek to denigrate it as best they can.<br /><br />Though the Mahabharata at over two thousand years old is the world's<br />oldest and longest national epic, Indian leftists don't even want it<br />taught in the schools (even when the common people find great pride<br />in watching the Mahabharata on television).<br /><br />Actually the distortion of history has been done intentionally by<br />many modern Indian historians, particularly covering over historical<br />wrongs against Hindus. They believe that by correcting history that<br />the present can be changed. They pretend that the generally cruel<br />Muslim rule in India was benign and secular so that this account will<br />serve to make modern Hindus and Muslims more benign and secular and<br />help them bury the past.<br /><br />India has not faced its past in order not to offend minorities in the<br />country, who may not resonate with the older Hindu and Buddhist<br />cultures of the country.<br /><br />It has also been intentionally done in order to prevent the majority<br />community from awakening from its colonial and religious oppression,<br />fearing this would increase communal disharmony, even though<br />distortions caused by this, like the image of Hindus as backward<br />idolaters, continue in the world media today.<br /><br />The result is that the country lacks a genuine national pride and a<br />sense of its continuity to ancient times.<br /><br />History and National Pride<br /><br />One of the main purposes of history books, as taught in different<br />countries in the world, is to instill a sense of national pride and<br />honor. Whether it is the United States, Great Britain, Russia,<br />Germany or China, this is certainly the case today and has been so as<br />long as these countries have existed as modern nations.<br /><br />The lives of great leaders, particularly the founders of the country<br />are highlighted, the continuity of the nation's history is<br />emphasized, and the importance of the nation in the history of the<br />world and the greatness of the national culture are stressed.<br />Students are expected to come away from reading accounts of their<br />history with a sense of national greatness and purpose, not only for<br />the past but also for the future.<br /><br />However, India is a strange and unique country in which history books<br />are often anti-national in nature. India has largely kept in tact the<br />British approach to Indian history devised in the colonial era.<br /><br />History books in India try to ignore the dominant Hindu ethos of the<br />country and its history before the Islamic period. India's greatest<br />historical and cultural document, the Mahabharata, is hardly given<br />any attention in the schools. So too, the Vedas, Ramayana, Puranas,<br />Buddhist Jatakas and other prime historical and cultural documents of<br />the country are ignored because of their religious overtones. If they<br />do address India as a nation, it is only India of the independence<br />movement that they acknowledge, as if prior to 1947 India did not<br />really exist.<br /><br />While Nehru is made important, older kings from the Rig Vedic<br />Bharatas to Yudishthira of the Mahabharata period to the Marathas of<br />the eighteenth century are hardly mentioned. There is no real sense<br />of any historical continuity to the culture, much less to the country.<br /><br />While Mahatma Gandhi is emphasized, the greater spiritual traditions<br />of India and its great teachers from the Vedic rishis, Vedantic,<br />Buddhist and Jain sages to modern savants like Sri Aurobindo and<br />Ramana Maharshi is not given much attention.<br /><br />It is true that history should not be a mere instrument of a<br />destructive nationalism and should avoid instilling aggression<br />against other lands and peoples, even when upholding what is valuable<br />in a nation's history. But this does not require that the national<br />value of historical studies is negated altogether.<br /><br />The question, therefore, is how the history accounts in India can be<br />made to reflect and instill a genuine nationalism and sense of the<br />country's history and destiny.<br /><br />India, after all, is one of the great civilizations of the world,<br />with cultural traditions that have much value for humanity. Such<br />historical accounts must reflect the richness and diversity of Indic<br />civilization, but they cannot ignore its unity and continuity either.<br /><br />The fact is that you cannot build a nation without creating history<br />books that instill a positive nationalism, particularly in the youth.<br /><br />The real danger in India is not the arising of a chauvinistic<br />nationalism like that of Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy?which are<br />foreign to the mentality and ethos of the country?but a lack of<br />national spirit and historical consciousness that keeps people<br />alienated from their roots and the country divided.<br /><br />India needs a real national spirit and for this a national sense of<br />history, pride and purpose is required. A true Indian nationalism<br />will be rooted in an Indian ethos of dharma, spirituality and<br />pluralism, but this does not mean there can be no national or<br />historical pride without encouraging communalism in the country.<br /><br />On the contrary, a greater sense of national identity would be the<br />best thing to counter the disintegrating influence of religious,<br />castist and regional interests that are bringing the country down.<br /><br />Therefore we must ask: Why can't Indians connect India's traditional<br />ancient literature, the Vedas, with its archaeology through Harappa<br />and the many Sarasvati river sites? Why can't Indians find national<br />pride in their own history both on literary and archaeological<br />levels? Why should history in India be used for national shame,<br />rather than national pride? Why should the history of India place<br />Indic civilization out of India? These are questions that must be<br />answered.<br /><br />The subject of history in the western context is a very different<br />than in the Indian context. In the western view, history is mainly an<br />account of political events and economic progress, a purely outward<br />affair.<br /><br />In the Hindu view, history is a means of teaching detachment, showing<br />how great kings and kingdoms come and go in the course of time. It<br />has an inner value as a spiritual teaching about the nature of human<br />life and the need for liberation from worldly concerns. In the<br />western view, history is progressive from the crude beginnings of<br />agriculture and village life moving forward to the present day urban<br />culture. In the Hindu view, history is cyclical, with various<br />cultures coming and going over time as the soul seeks liberation from<br />the phenomenal world.<br /><br />The western progressive account of history is quite flawed. For<br />example, the first civilizations of the ancient world that we can<br />document?including Egypt, Sumeria, India and China?did not regard<br />themselves as the first but were aware of many cultures and kingdoms<br />before them, particularly prior to a great flood. The civilizations<br />that we regard as the first saw themselves as very old with many<br />antecedents! Yet we pretend that there was nothing before them! In<br />addition, the civilizations of the Third Millennium BCE, like those<br />of Egypt and Harappan/Sarasvati India, had better urban and<br />architectural achievements than those that followed for many<br />centuries. Even Europe had its Dark Ages after the Roman period in<br />which much knowledge was lost. This idea of history as linear<br />progress is clearly not the case. While humanity has progressed<br />scientifically, this is mainly over the past five hundred years. On<br />the other hand, we see a spiritual decline since ancient times, and<br />over the last century we can note a decline in culture, art, music<br />and philosophy in Europe itself, coinciding or even caused by great<br />advances in science.<br /><br />As India is the only civilization of antiquity to survive the<br />onslaught of time, it is the special responsibility of Indians to<br />discover not only their history but also that of the entire ancient<br />world. Just as there are unquestioned distortions of ancient India,<br />similar distortions of other ancient cultures also exist. . Revamping<br />the way history is taught in Indian schools would be a major step in<br />the direction of a more authentic and spiritual sensitive history of<br />the world. It is a scientific and spiritual imperative, not only for<br />India but for all countries.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Yahoo!
