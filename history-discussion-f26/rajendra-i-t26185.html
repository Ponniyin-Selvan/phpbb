			<div class="content">SPS,<br /><br />You are right. That is why I thought for a minute before I coined <br />the words "Instigated Wars". I am pretty sure, Rajendra I would not <br />have felt, his own invasions, as a problem. But when some one <br />instigates when his concentration is elsewhere, then it is a problem <br />and you have clearly exposed it in your last para regarding the <br />inability of Kundavai and Vimaladitya.<br /><br />Yes, I feel disgusted about the fact that the Foreign Invasions <br />(through the seas) of Rajendra I was never accorded the grandeur, it <br />deserved, in history. We do not know why, but Ghazni the rogue <br />emperor, who destroyed almost all the North, North Central and <br />Western India, never ventured into Rajendra-I's territory. <br /><br />Madhan mentions about this in his book "vandhArgaL vendRargaL". <br />(That was a real "bloody" account of the Ruthless invasions of the <br />Mohammedans). He even throws the question as to whether Ghazni never <br />had the courage to venture into Rajendra's territory. But does not <br />conclude and leaves it for the readers to conclude. Whatever the <br />reason may be, the fact that Ghazni did not venture into Rajendra's <br />territory, speaks volumes about his greatness!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately all the historians from the north were so biased that <br />they even refused to look down to the history of the south, except <br />for the cursory glance. This is clearly indicated by <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> Sastri in <br />his book "History of South India". <br /><br />Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one and only Sun!!! <br /><br />I feel <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s fame eclipsed Rajendra's only because, after the <br />initial invasions to expand the empire, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> concentrated a lot on <br />the people welfare and local administration which kept him amids the <br />masses. While we know that Rajendra was always fighting and <br />expanding the empire to a larger extent than that was under <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. So <br />keeping the popularity aside, both were equally great in respective <br />aspects and I, personally, cannot favour one over the other.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vinjamoor_venkatesh" <br />   wrote: <br />  <br />    In fact, it was <br />    recorded that even Rajendra I did not have a peaceful reign and <br />  had <br />    to involve himself in a lot of "instigated" wars, though he won <br />  all <br />    or most of them.

			<div class="content">Yes. Rajendra's mother was Vanavanmadevi which Kalki shortened as Vanathi. Vanathi <br />alias Vanavanmadevi is a real life character who was the mother of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>, butthe <br />characterization of Vanathi in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is purely Kalki's imagination. For that matter, I would say <br />all the characterizations are Kalki's imagination and only the characters might be real.<br /><br />Its an unsolved mystery, why Rajendra built a pallipadai for his step mother <br />Panchavanmadevi and not to his own mother vanavanmadevi. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>RAvi, very good to know, thank you.<br />  <br />  All history buffs, I have a question.

It is hard to imagine<br />  a lady of Vaanathi&#39;s character give birth to a warrior<br />  of his stature. Was Vaanathi&#39;s character purely<br />  Kalki&#39;s imagination or is there any indication of her<br />  in historical records?
