			<div class="content">dear Mr SPS;<br />Dont u think a 16 or 18 year old can plot and kill his own brother? I think<br />this is possible. Wasn't <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> younger than 18 when he fought battles in<br />Lanka? I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was mature enough at 16-18 and certainly had the mental<br />and physical capabilities to carry out such a scheme.<br />We are still not able solve a murder which happened 1000 ears ago. There<br />have been generations who have been trying to solve this mystery and i doubt<br />whether we ever will.<br />Of all the people who had probably killed <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>who was the person who had<br />skill to do it and hide for 1000years and more! <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>! He even has the least<br />amount of people suspecting him!Killing brothers at 18 for the kingdom was<br />probably not that big a deal then.<br />I am sure some novelist will write a book on this and the debate would<br />become even more controversial.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br /><br />On 6/14/06, Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Arun Krishnan"<br />   wrote:<br /> <br />  Dear Arun,<br /> <br />  <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was speculated and a book did spring on this a decade ago.

			<div class="content">Dear SPS,<br /><br />As I mentioned, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> + Kundavai could have done it. True <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was only 18ish..<br />but then we ought to take into account that he was already a battle hardened<br />veteran by then. Also, the more I think about Kundavai, the more I get the<br />feeling that this was one tough lady. Perhaps she was the brains behind it?<br />Think about it.. in those days (why even in these days) when the "kal<br />aanaalum kanavan" mantra used to rule a woman, how could she remain behind<br />in her piranthaveedu and not go to her husband's house? <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had enough wives<br />to take care of Rajendra Chozhan. I would suspect that Kundavai was the<br />brains behind the murder. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was probably too headstrong and independent for<br />Kundavai to control while <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, who probably adored her was more pliant <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/14/06, Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Arun Krishnan"<br />   wrote:<br /> <br />  Dear Arun,<br /> <br />  <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was speculated and a book did spring on this a decade ago.
