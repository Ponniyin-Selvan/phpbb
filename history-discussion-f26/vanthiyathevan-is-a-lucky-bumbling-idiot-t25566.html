Yeah he was lucky, but fortune favours the<br />brave.<br /><br />he was brave enough to take a spear meant for another is one instance enough<br />for his heroism,<br />also, he was a figther and a spy, not a detective to deduce things. really<br />his quick wit and<br />braveness has brought him the fan following.<br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />On 12/27/06, Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Siva,<br /> <br />  There are lots.. if you look at historical novels in english..<br /> <br />  well "The count of monte christo" is one.. another would be D&#39;Artagnan<br />  from the Three Musketeers"..<br />  From: tamil.. the hero of "kadal pura" is a very enterprising lad.. sure<br />  there are instances were luck plays a part but they also create their own<br />  luck sometimes through their daring and bravado...<br /> <br />  <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br /> <br />  Cheers,<br /> <br />  Arun<br /> <br />  On 12/27/06, sivaram Kannan  wrote:<br />   <br />   <br />    Hi,<br />   <br />    May I know your favorite hero from other book you have mentioned?
