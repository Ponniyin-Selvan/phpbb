			<div class="content">I am not that learned to give facts and points like you people do. <br /><br />During this discussion it was pointed out that no country or society <br />will be the same for ever. There are obviously ups and downs. From <br />1AD to 5AD we call it dark ages of Tamil Nadu because no remarkable <br />develpment was found during that period. Obviously those times, this <br />part of the country would have been ruled by many such kurunila <br />mannargal as you said.<br />But then came the pallavas and at one point, whole of Indian <br />subcontinent (more or less) was ruled by only three prominent kings, <br />Mahendra in south, Pulikesi in the central and Harsha in the north. <br />We make loud noise in this group that <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> is one of the most <br />successful conqeurers of India (putting SE asia he conquered,sure <br />its more than half the size of India). Kings like Ashoka did bring <br />the entire nation in one umbrella..<br /><br />Even during supreme muslim rule, whole of south came under Vijanagar <br />emipire. So its not wise to say that no one united India before the <br />brits. Times change and only during 19th century the whole world <br />talked about democracy and hence the single nation concepts came <br />into existence. Till then the entire world never had a fixed <br />boundary.<br /><br />So saying that ony Brits united us as a single country is just an <br />incident in Indian history. If not for brits, someone else would <br />have done it, its the compulsion of time. But at the same time, I <br />really appreciate Brits for doing this.<br /><br />If something has to happen, it will...maybe through someone. As a <br />good human, I should thank that person whole heartedly, but should <br />not belive that, if not for that person, my life would have come to <br />a standstill. if not that person some xyz would have come my way. <br />But at the same time, i should not take this arguement and be <br />thankless to the person who helped. The same is my feelign towards <br />brits.<br /><br />Comapring the rule of different rulers, everyone has their own pros <br />and cons. Ofcourse the maharaja's period were the dark ages, because <br />India didnt get a great leader during those times. Saying british <br />rule was better than muslim rule, is like saying one fire wood is <br />better than the other. Everyone ruined us in their own ways. If you <br />say, British gave us all the technology we have today, the muslims <br />gave us all the architecture marvels we have today. Taj has brought <br />India more pride than Indian Railways. So will you accept if I say <br />that Mogul rule was better than British rule, because Moguls gave an <br />identity to India?<br /><br />VK arguement - we have a level playing field after the british <br />period. Great joke. Can i contest an election and do good for this <br />country today? You will yes, but its possible only in papers...as <br />per law, yes I can. but practicality??? Can a qualified person get <br />the required thing life, let it be education or job...are we treated <br />equally in India? NO. Who brought these caste discriminations? <br />Sanathana dharma had only varna's which is profession based and <br />never caste based. Its the brain child of the 'divide and rule' <br />policy, which we suffer till date.<br /><br />Comparing congress and non congress party - Except for a five year <br />BJP rule and 2 year JP rule, when was India ruled by Non congress <br />party? comparing 7 years to 53 years is kidding.<br /><br />I am ready to accept any facts...will the govt. be bold enough to <br />publicise it? Forget Gandhi's personal life, no one is going to gain <br />anything out of it. But how many facts which affect the common <br />masses have been suppressed in India? Why dont you point those <br />facts...who cares if Gandhi had an affair with a married women or <br />Nehru had an affair with Mrs.MB. They were public figures who did a <br />great deal to the nation.Period. If they prove to be unfit leaders, <br />as an Individual its my liberty to change my mind. Nation is in no <br />way getting affected by this. But surely the nation is affected by <br />many a false propaganda which the brits sow seeds for.<br /><br />British rule is like this - Giving a hungry man a pot full of rice <br />with a drop of poison mixed in it. They gave India whatever we have <br />today, but with a poisioned minds all around. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi sathish<br />  <br />  innum varalayE nu ninaichen.<br />  <br />  could you list the wrongs the british did for discussion purpose?<br />  <br />  and who would you rate as our best rulers.<br />  the moslems<br />  the maharajahs<br />  the british<br />  the congress party<br />  the non congress parties.<br />  <br />  Vk was saying india is a much level playing field for all people <br />  after the british came and left.<br />  evils are every where and india is able to sort out its problems<br />  <br />  a false shield of patrioism is being raised by many to hide behind <br />  unanswerable problems.<br />  <br />  if somebody said mahatma gandhi had an affair with a married woman <br />  after he took control of the freedom struggle and had 4 grown up <br />sons <br />  would you term it un patriotic.<br />  <br />  what if his own grandson researches and finds it.<br />  <br />  thats the main subject of the book that was released a year back.<br />  arent patriotism and the unvarnished truth compatible????<br />  venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

If you <br />  say, British gave us all the technology we have today, the muslims <br />  gave us all the architecture marvels we have today. Taj has brought <br />  India more pride than Indian Railways. So will you accept if I say <br />  that Mogul rule was better than British rule, because Moguls gave <br />an <br />  identity to India?<br />  <br />  VK arguement - we have a level playing field after the british <br />  period. Great joke. Can i contest an election and do good for this <br />  country today? You will yes, but its possible only in papers...as <br />  per law, yes I can. but practicality??? Can a qualified person get <br />  the required thing life, let it be education or job...are we <br />treated <br />  equally in India? NO. Who brought these caste discriminations? <br />  Sanathana dharma had only varna&#39;s which is profession based and <br />  never caste based. Its the brain child of the &#39;divide and rule&#39; <br />  policy, which we suffer till date.<br />  <br />  Comparing congress and non congress party - Except for a five year <br />  BJP rule and 2 year JP rule, when was India ruled by Non congress <br />  party? comparing 7 years to 53 years is kidding.<br />  <br />  I am ready to accept any facts...will the govt. be bold enough to <br />  publicise it? Forget Gandhi&#39;s personal life, no one is going to <br />gain <br />  anything out of it. But how many facts which affect the common <br />  masses have been suppressed in India? Why dont you point those <br />  facts...who cares if Gandhi had an affair with a married women or <br />  Nehru had an affair with Mrs.MB. They were public figures who did a <br />  great deal to the nation.Period. If they prove to be unfit leaders, <br />  as an Individual its my liberty to change my mind. Nation is in no <br />  way getting affected by this. But surely the nation is affected by <br />  many a false propaganda which the brits sow seeds for.<br />  <br />  British rule is like this - Giving a hungry man a pot full of rice <br />  with a drop of poison mixed in it. They gave India whatever we have <br />  today, but with a poisioned minds all around. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Hi sathish<br />    <br />    innum varalayE nu ninaichen.<br />    <br />    could you list the wrongs the british did for discussion purpose?<br />    <br />    and who would you rate as our best rulers.<br />    the moslems<br />    the maharajahs<br />    the british<br />    the congress party<br />    the non congress parties.<br />    <br />    Vk was saying india is a much level playing field for all people <br />    after the british came and left.<br />    evils are every where and india is able to sort out its problems<br />    <br />    a false shield of patrioism is being raised by many to hide <br />behind <br />    unanswerable problems.<br />    <br />    if somebody said mahatma gandhi had an affair with a married <br />woman <br />    after he took control of the freedom struggle and had 4 grown up <br />  sons <br />    would you term it un patriotic.<br />    <br />    what if his own grandson researches and finds it.<br />    <br />    thats the main subject of the book that was released a year back.<br />    arent patriotism and the unvarnished truth compatible????<br />    venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">You can't analyze history with counting your<br />patriotism.<br /><br />In history emperors/kings plundered countries, killed<br />people.

Frustration on post independence<br />India<br />  is not to be diverted as &#39;oh the british were better&#39;, that is<br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.<br />   <br />    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability,<br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly<br />  set afire by the British.<br />   <br />    Sati: <br />    1. A certain &#39;indian&#39; by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core<br />of<br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. &#40;British never<br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have<br />  added more points below.&#41;<br />    2.Talk about a widow&#39;s life without her husband was not easy at<br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage.<br />honestly<br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life<br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />  1800&#39;s which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of<br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />  hindu dharma. &#40;hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />  with western explorers landing in India...&#41;<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say &#39;sumangaliya poyidanum&#39;. It ties<br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />  where we need &#39;our own space&#39;.<br />   <br />    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />open.<br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new<br />  definition as caste politics now.<br />   <br />    Child mairrage: The term &#39;kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />kaamanai<br />  vella vendum&#39; has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39;<br />was<br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />dating<br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />is<br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our<br />great<br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />were<br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio&#39;s. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />dated<br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent &#40;thanks to the west&#41; to<br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama&#39;s model of life.<br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the &#39;sexual outlet&#39; or the<br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />  &#39;talent&#39;.<br />   <br />    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious<br />comment<br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />serious<br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />in<br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country.<br />   <br />    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />  by looking at bridges and railways &#40;oh great again we have lousy<br />  trains vs the TUBE in london&#41;.<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />management<br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />british<br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as &#39;Oh Almighty British<br />-<br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat&#39;.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />india<br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />  Kalki&#39;s<br />    comments on Churchill&#39;s thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />Britain<br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />were<br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />worthless<br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />  does<br />    not exist without the west.<br />   <br />    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain<br />is<br />  Europe&#39;s crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation<br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is<br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them<br />making<br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather<br />than<br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.<br />   <br />    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more<br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor<br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.<br />   <br />   <br />    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real<br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.<br />   <br />    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british<br />able<br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were<br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have<br />an<br />  idea now.<br />   <br />    -- Ravi<br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: viru <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2007 8:21:21 AM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: British India vs Post Independence<br />  India<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    Dear Venkateswaran,<br />   <br />    I would definitely be against all your points. What you<br />described,<br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />  characteristics of india.<br />   <br />    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />  of ourself.<br />   <br />    Ok. let me counter your points.<br />   <br />    1&#41; The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />you<br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />a<br />  women committing sati. &#40;page#8 in the following link&#41;<br />   <br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments<br />   <br />    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />dress<br />  style is entirely different..<br />   <br />    3. Untouchability: <br />   <br />    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste&#39;s family.<br />   <br />    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />india,<br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".<br />   <br />    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.<br />   <br />    4. Education & Employment: <br />   <br />    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />  ignorance. As per dharampal&#39;s finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />in<br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />  today&#39;s BC/MBC & some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />  all over madras presidency.<br />   <br />    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.<br />   <br />     tree.zip <br />   <br />    5&#41; Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />  western nations, where women is an use & throw entity till 19th<br />  century, we had adequate representation & protection of women .<br />   <br />    6. Devadasi: <br />   <br />    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Devadasi<br />   <br />    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />  sin. &#40;whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />the<br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />effect.&#41;<br />   <br />    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />bharatanatyam,<br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded<br />to<br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.<br />   <br />   <br />    7. Slavery: <br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.<br />   <br />    8. Child Marriage: <br />   <br />    Its really researchable, what&#39;s wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />  girl child should reach her husband&#39;s house, before puberty. The<br />  girl child grows as part of her husband&#39;s family, right from her<br />  childhood and get adapted to it.<br />   <br />    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />  days.<br />   <br />    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in<br />the<br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"<br />   <br />    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />  it is considered as evil.<br />   <br />    9. Priestly Class<br />   <br />    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />and<br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />with<br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />  vellalars.<br />   <br />    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.<br />   <br />    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed<br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.<br />   <br />    10. Suppression of mother tongues: <br />   <br />    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />  mother tongues..<br />   <br />    11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />   <br />    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that&#39;s why, its<br />sacrificed<br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..<br />   <br />    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />  community &#40;not to our god..&#41; according to tradition is barbarious,<br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..<br />   <br />    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.<br />   <br />    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />that,<br />  let&#39;s stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.<br />   <br />   <br />    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.<br />   <br />    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.<br />   <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a><!-- m --> Goa_Inquisition<br />    <br />   <br />   <br />    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br />  is barbaric.<br />   <br />    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />our<br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />  still india is our only land for us&#41;<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Venkateswaran K<br />   wrote: <br />     <br />      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations: <br />     <br />      1&#41; The Sati system<br />      2&#41; Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3&#41; Untouchability & bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4&#41; Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5&#41; Fate of widows<br />      6&#41; Marriage of girls to gods &#40; pottu kattutal &#41; & the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7&#41; Slavery<br />      8&#41; Marriage at childhood<br />      9&#41; Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10&#41; Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11&#41; Sacrifice of animals in rituals.<br />     <br />      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed.<br />     <br />      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</div></blockquote></div>
