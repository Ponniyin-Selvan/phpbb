			<div class="content">Bronzes of Khmer: <br /><br />Khmer bronze work presents itself differently from stone<br />sculpture both in its execution and use. The production<br />of a lost-wax bronze involved a process of modelling<br />rather than carving. In this regard, bronze casting<br />presents affinities to stucco and terracotta modelling. The<br />virtuosity of the Mon peoples of central and northeastern<br />Thailand in modelling these materials suggests Khmer interaction<br />with the Mon throughout the period of Khmer<br />stone temple building. <br /><br />The majority of bronze objects produced by the<br />Khmer were part of a portable set of ritual objects. This<br />very portability has made it difficult to provenance<br />bronzes.<br /><br />In comparison with finds of stone sculpture, a great<br />number of pre-Angkorean bronze images have been<br />found in Thailand. Most are Mahayana images such as<br />Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. <br /><br />Sounds familiar ...read below<br /><br />Bronze Sculptures Of Chola Period 				<br /><br />Bronze SculpturesChola-period Bronzes are praised for the figures of <br />sensuous depiction and for the detailed treatment used in their <br />clothing and jewelry. During Chola-period, Bronzes made images were <br />created with using the Lost wax technique. Although In India, Bronze <br />casting is done from many centuries, especially in south India, huge <br />size of images and large number of bronze sculptures were cast <br />during the Chola period itself. This fact illustrates the importance <br />of Bronze sculptures during this period.			<br />	<br />				<br />The Chola period is considered as a remarkable period for its <br />sculptures in Bronzes. From: this period only, many fine figures made <br />from Bronze, an alloy of copper are famous - it contains Shiva in <br />various forms, such as Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, and the Shiva <br />saints.				<br />				<br />Though as stated above, the iconographic conventions were <br />established traditionally & all rules were conformed strictly to the <br />sculptors, they worked with great freedom in real sense during the <br />11th and the 12th centuries, to achieve a classic quality. The best <br />example of this is the form of Nataraja, the Divine Dancer, a form <br />of Shiva as a Lord of the dance is a creation of this period.	<br />			<br />				<br />Chola Bronze sculptures are admired for its artistic quality in the <br />Indian sub-continent. The art works of these period are famous for <br />their subtle modeling and clear outline marked on the form, as well <br />as for maintaining a ideal balance of graceful realism and heroic <br />classicism.				<br />				<br />Bronze SculpturesDuring the reign of the Chola kings, they <br />emphasized on building lavish temples in southern India and brought <br />a new, more emotional kind of religious cult. Through <br />representations of many deities like Lord Shiva, were seen as <br />supreme & above all, daily rituals performed for him were <br />strengthened an assurance of deity`s protection to all his <br />worshippers. Shiva`s Nataraja sculpture will be prominently marked <br />whenever Bronze sculpture is mentioned.			<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lotussculpture.com/bronze_sculpture_bronze_casting.htm">http://www.lotussculpture.com/bronze_sc ... asting.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />More on bronze <br /><br />Bronze is basically an alloy that is traditionally composed of tin. <br />Bronze is of exceptional historical interest and still used widely <br />for various applications.

And even the poets who made <br />poetry on them were also deified with the images, which were made up <br />of Bronzes only!<br /><br />The stone sculptures and the their inner sanctum images makes the <br />temple remained on a fixed place. But newly emerged religious <br />concepts during the 10th century demanded that the deities should <br />appear in a variety of public roles. As a consequence, large bronze <br />images were created as these images could be carried outside the <br />temple places.</div>
