			<div class="content">Chola empire compared with the other empire on their<br />time. It was great, building dams when there was no<br />such technologies existed elsewhere. 80 tons of single<br />stone put on top of the temple 1000 years ago not<br />simple. There was no such granes those times to lift<br />up such weight. So lots of historians wonder about<br />chola emperors and their achievements.<br /><br />In 10 AD Chola empire had naval force controlled<br />Indian ocean waters and boosted sea trade. During that<br />time the historians never heard of any naval force<br />elsewhere.<br /><br />Karikal Cholan dreamt of broader India conquering in<br />whole went upto Himalayas. He made world's first dam.<br />Rajaraja Cholan&Rajedra Cholan put the empire zenith.<br /><br />There were lots and lots of greats happened in Chola<br />empire than elsewhere.<br /><br />Thats why historians wondered if Rajaraja Cholan&<br />Rajendra Cholan concentrated towards north India than<br />going to east, India's fate would have changed by the<br />time. They would have made fullstop to the moghuls<br />invasion.<br /><br />So Subbu can wonder by reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> than fault finding.<br />Historians never found any fault with the glorious<br />Chola.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- kmsubbu22  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I do not see much of a difference.<br /> <br />  Both - Chola dynasty and " &#40;current TN&#41; " dynasty -<br />  are all<br />  about &#39;holding the power with in the family.&#39;<br /> <br />  in the past - it was about Chola Mandalam.<br />  Now, it is about Tamil Nadu.<br /> <br />  in the past, it was using bows and arrows.<br />  now, through elections and gundas.<br /> <br />  in the past, anyone against the king would be<br />  killed/exterminated/excommunicated.<br />  now, the same occurs. or atleast you talk filth<br />  about the other guy.<br /> <br />  But, now, we call the people/politicians who join<br />  forces just for<br />  votes as Opportunists.<br />  In the past, if they had done the same thing. it is<br />  not Opportunism.<br /> <br />  ==============================================<br /> <br />  The past kings built reservoirs, etc.<br />  the present day Ministers bring foreign investment.<br /> <br />  I do not see much of a change in the mood or the<br />  selfishness of the<br />  rulers at any point of time.<br /> <br />  it has always been Divide and Rule. in the past, it<br />  was divide my<br />  kingdom from others.<br />  now, it is &#39;divide by caste.&#39;<br /> <br />  ===============================================<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, SARAVANAN APS<br /> <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />     <br />      &#39;This King was very clever.

			<div class="content">Subbu,<br /><br />I tend to agree with you. See it is this way: I believe that human nature <br />hasn't changed all that much in the many thousands of years that have passed <br />since we came down from the trees. THe same factors such as greed, jealousy, <br />love, hate, anger etc predominate. Hence, I doubt if the Chozha times were <br />any different. It is just that we tend to glorify our past. See we do that <br />even with the immediate past: so suddenly Netaji Bose becomes a God-like <br />figure who can do no wrong. People tend to forget that he was also a man and <br />made many of the same mistakes other humans make. I am sure Vijayalaya was <br />driven by the same need for self-preservation that say a Karunanidhi or a <br />Jayalalitha are driven by; that, and power of course. It is another matter <br />that Vijayalaya's descendents did some wonderful stuff after him.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />P. S.

			<div class="content">The Kings did not go for corruption.

They contributed their<br />personal wealth when there are disasters.<br /><br />All that greediness, hatred, jealousy i cannot see in them because they<br />were guided well by their prime ministers. We had Chankaya Shastra<br />and several other dharmas.<br /><br />The arguement that he was also a man and he has to commit mistakes is<br />something too weak.<br /><br />Wait a minute I had Interacted with many of my relatives who were born<br />before Independence and there is a great difference in they way people<br />were thinking those days and now.

			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />Let Mr.Subbu (& Mr.Arun) first understand the difference between<br />aristocracy and democracy. In Demo'crazy' the rulers are elected by<br />people and are subject to change after the tenure. In aristocracy,<br />it is like this :<br /><br />The leader of a group becomes the ruler of the group's territory<br />first.<br />Then he creates armies with his group members he is ready to protect<br />all of them from attack by somebody who wants to rule this territory.<br />Then in order to save his group he starts capturing potential<br />enemies. (Similar to today's coporate 'mergers' and 'acquisitions').<br />In return for his service of protecting the people and in taking<br />care of their needs and safety, he charges tax, which is accounted<br />for and maintained.<br />And since the baton passed through lineage, it was understood that<br />his son will take care of the country after him.<br /><br />Please do not compare or equate that with our politicians wanting to<br />anoint their children as "people's representatives" citing 'thondar<br />viruppam' and 'makkalin anbu kattalai' as reasons (I am restraining<br />myself from giving names).<br /><br />At least kings said they were the ruling dynasties and ruled us,<br />rather than today's 'leaders' telling us that it was 'makkal aatchi'<br />and yet giving all posts to relatives and coterie people.<br /><br />Regarding Vijayalaya Chozhan, let us understand one thing :<br />Diplomacy in inter-state / inter-national affairs is always meant to<br />be 'selfish' ,i.e. keeping with the nation's interests. We (India)<br />might be friends with Nepal today and enemies tomorrow, if we find<br />Nepal's interests harm others. Do not our own relatives, friends and<br />neighbours become our enemies if we get hurt by them, if there is a<br />business rivalry or worst, drainage dispute between two houses ?<br /><br />And regarding somebody harming the king being punished, what do<br />Subbu and Arun think - if India's PM is attacked, we should take it<br />as part of the attacker's democratic right and leave him ? Mind you -<br />An attack on a ruler is an attack on the nation. On opposers being<br />punished, Kalki clearly criticises the "'Paathala chirai' punishment<br />without any enquiry" followed by Pazhuvettaraiyars. Even on Aditha<br />Karikalan's murder, Sundara Chozhar conducts an enquiry - mind it,<br />no murders !!! (Subbu, please read on, without jumping to negative<br />conclusions, unless such quick jumping is the purpose of your<br />reading or posting).<br /><br />On Azhvaarkadiyan's views, what does Subbu want to say - All the<br />characters in a book should have the same view ? Let us understand<br />that characters speak their mind and not OUR mind. Also, if you take<br />his context of speech, you will understand that he is in his<br />espionage operation and is spying the enemies while uttering these<br />words. Meaning - he hates war, being a Bhaktha, at the same time<br />knows the inevitability of it in order to keep anti-national<br />elements at bay. It is better to have an early but smaller battle if<br />it can avoid a big devastating war.<br /><br />(Like life insurance policies - though we have some on our own<br />lives, we would not like a death claim to be made on our life<br />no ??? - sorry no hurt intended)<br /><br />Also, does not Arulmozhi take care of the civilians of Srilanka ?<br />What about the Elelasingan story ? Boss, there is much more to<br />read.....Oorukaiyai mattum saptuttu saappade nalla illainnu<br />sollaatheenga...<br /><br />And one basic fact : We are reading a historic novel on what<br />happened - not on what should have happened and who was right or<br />wrong. We are not here to comment on somebody else's lives more so<br />because they lived in circumstances which we can not even fully<br />imagine. And remember, one who is not proud of his rich heritage,<br />may not make his successors proud of him.<br /><br />Thanks & Warm Regards,<br />Venkat</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Venkat,<br /><br />First, we are not reading a historical novel per se. It is more "historical <br />fiction" which means that most of what happened in ponniyin selvan is the <br />imagination of the author, but based around a few of the facts. However, <br />what makes Ponniyin Selvan great is that the imagination of the author is so <br />vivid and so realistic that the lines between fiction and historical fact <br />become blurred. Which is why there are still people who don't realize that <br />there was never a real Nandini character historically.<br /><br />As far as comparing Democracy and Aristocracy... that was not my point. My <br />point was to mention that human nature hasn't changed over all these years. <br />Yes, we tend to glorify our past that isn't bad because it gives us <br />something to cherish and to be proud of. My point is that all these <br />characters we glorify, were also human beings and hence had the same foibles <br />as say, you and me. Again the version of history we hear changes depending <br />on which side we hear it from.<br /><br />For example, the other day, I was discussing the Pallava rule with a <br />Kannadiga friend and extolling its virtues. I mentioned the Vatapi pillayar <br />and how Paranjyoti got it to TN. He then came up with a statement which went <br />like "oh yeah.. they looted vatapi and stole it" or words to that effect. So <br />it depends on which side you are on. However, on the whole, the Chola rule <br />seems to have benefited the tamilians for which we should all feel proud. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br />On 5/17/05, sridhar rathinam  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Subbu<br />  I can understand your concerns bu You have to hold your horses before you <br />  whip them if you want to reach the destination if you whip them you wont <br />  reach your destination only on the road side of a vayalkadu in the ammavasai <br />  iruttu like the poor madhuranthangan....<br />  Who is madhuranthagan and what was he doing by the road side wait till <br />  you reach 3rd Bagam<br />  I really feel sorry for you subbu because by the time you go finish the <br />  novel you are going to get all the surprises and twists from others...<br />  At the outset we all have to ashamed as tamilians and Indians to let a <br />  Democracy give way to Autocracy and monarchy like rule....So be self <br />  critical of today not a piece of literature written on evidence of the <br />  past!!!! <br />  ministers bringing revenue and welfare of the people from present day <br />  politicians you should be joking!!

They punished people only<br />  after detailed investigation.<br /> <br />  Women could walk in the night without any danger.<br />  Patrol men were doing their duty.<br /> <br />  No police man was there to frame charges.<br /> <br />  Kings were very just and if they were proved wrong they committed<br />  suicide like Pandiyan Nedunchezian.<br /> <br />  They were very devoted to god whether cheras, chozhas or Pandiyas.<br /> <br />  Taxes were just and were used for welfare of people. wealth was not<br />  accumulated by the kings for their own needs. They contributed their<br />  personal wealth when there are disasters.<br /> <br />  All that greediness, hatred, jealousy i cannot see in them because<br />they<br />  were guided well by their prime ministers. We had Chankaya Shastra<br />  and several other dharmas.<br /> <br />  The arguement that he was also a man and he has to commit mistakes<br />is<br />  something too weak.<br /> <br />  Wait a minute I had Interacted with many of my relatives who were<br />born<br />  before Independence and there is a great difference in they way<br />people<br />  were thinking those days and now. Take for example Kalki, Bharathi<br />you<br />  can never get the same type of people now.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Thirumalai</div></blockquote></div>
