			<div class="content">History has many events that have changed the course of history to a greater extent. Those events makes us to think, 'Why it happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?? There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br /><br />Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br /><br />1. Huns invasion<br />The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn't go back to their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled North India.<br /><br />2. After Harshavardhana<br />After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha's death, apparently without any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly into small states.<br />If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The disintegration of the Harsha's Empire and the chaos created by the power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br /><br />3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a part against Muslim invasion.<br />But Pallavas had two enemies to face (Chalukyas and Pandyas) that paved way for their decline and the emergence of Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own way, but rivalry between them didn't allow them to maintain a Great Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North India.<br /><br />4. North and South India's political disconnection.<br />After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century, the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas didn't tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had any contacts with Northwest India?<br />When the Tanjore's Great Temple and other chola temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade kind of wars didn't happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn't try their hand to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br /><br />5.Babur's Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur's intervention, succeeded in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties inflicted by Lodhi on Babur's forces, and believed that they could capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu Rajput hands.<br />The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga?s Rajputs heavily defeated these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his general Silhadi (Shiladitya) to the parley. Babur is said to have won over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga's army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had been removed.<br /><br />The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India's history would have been apparently different.<br /><br />6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />Hemu (Hemchandra) was a military chief of the Afghan King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India, taking advantage of Humayun's death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the title 'Raja Vikramaditya'.<br />To counter this, Bairam Khan (Akbar's guardian) marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat. Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />This is an example of a one-day event that could have changed history.<br /><br />7. Battle of Talikota (January 26, 1565)<br />The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates. Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of Vijayanagara.<br />The loss was more than, that it should have been, for some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing the defeat in war fled and didn't thought of holding it back, that caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of the last great southern empire in India.<br /><br />8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14, 1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha's power ended, and Ahmad Shah's Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />After this war, the Marathas faced problems within themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dhamo<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com</div>

Within a year he was dead, probably poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had been removed.<br /><br />The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India's history would have been apparently different.<br /><br />6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />Hemu (Hemchandra) was a military chief of the Afghan King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India, taking advantage of Humayun's death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the title 'Raja Vikramaditya'.<br />To counter this, Bairam Khan (Akbar's guardian) marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat. Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />This is an example of a one-day event that could have changed history.<br /><br />7. Battle of Talikota (January 26, 1565)<br />The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates. Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of Vijayanagara.<br />The loss was more than, that it should have been, for some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing the defeat in war fled and didn't thought of holding it back, that caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of the last great southern empire in India.<br /><br />8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14, 1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha's power ended, and Ahmad Shah's Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />After this war, the Marathas faced problems within themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dhamo<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Yahoo!

Those events makes us to think, 'Why it happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?? There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br /><br />Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br /><br />1. Huns invasion<br />The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn't go back to their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled North India.<br /><br />2. After Harshavardhana<br />After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha's death, apparently without any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly into small states.<br />If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The disintegration of the Harsha's Empire and the chaos created by the power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br /><br />3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a part against Muslim invasion.<br />But Pallavas had two enemies to face (Chalukyas and Pandyas) that paved way for their decline and the emergence of Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own way, but rivalry between them didn't allow them to maintain a Great Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North India.<br /><br />4. North and South India's political disconnection.<br />After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century, the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas didn't tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had any contacts with Northwest India?<br />When the Tanjore's Great Temple and other chola temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade kind of wars didn't happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn't try their hand to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br /><br />5.Babur's Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur's intervention, succeeded in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties inflicted by Lodhi on Babur's forces, and believed that they could capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu Rajput hands.<br />The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga?s Rajputs heavily defeated these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his general Silhadi (Shiladitya) to the parley. Babur is said to have won over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga's army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and costing him a likely victory.

Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />Hemu (Hemchandra) was a military chief of the Afghan King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India, taking advantage of Humayun's death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the title 'Raja Vikramaditya'.<br />To counter this, Bairam Khan (Akbar's guardian) marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat. Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />This is an example of a one-day event that could have changed history.<br /><br />7. Battle of Talikota (January 26, 1565)<br />The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates. Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of Vijayanagara.<br />The loss was more than, that it should have been, for some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing the defeat in war fled and didn't thought of holding it back, that caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of the last great southern empire in India.<br /><br />8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14, 1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha's power ended, and Ahmad Shah's Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />After this war, the Marathas faced problems within themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dhamo<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Yahoo!

Those events makes us to think, 'Why it happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?? There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br /><br />Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br /><br />1. Huns invasion<br />The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn't go back to their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled North India.<br /><br />2. After Harshavardhana<br />After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha's death, apparently without any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly into small states.<br />If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The disintegration of the Harsha's Empire and the chaos created by the power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br /><br />3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a part against Muslim invasion.<br />But Pallavas had two enemies to face (Chalukyas and Pandyas) that paved way for their decline and the emergence of Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own way, but rivalry between them didn't allow them to maintain a Great Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North India.<br /><br />4. North and South India's political disconnection.<br />After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century, the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas didn't tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had any contacts with Northwest India?<br />When the Tanjore's Great Temple and other chola temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade kind of wars didn't happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn't try their hand to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br /><br />5.Babur's Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur's intervention, succeeded in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties inflicted by Lodhi on Babur's forces, and believed that they could capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu Rajput hands.<br />The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga?s Rajputs heavily defeated these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his general Silhadi (Shiladitya) to the parley. Babur is said to have won over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga's army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had been removed.<br /><br />The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India's history would have been apparently different.<br /><br />6.

They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn't go back to<br />their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />North India.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>2. After Harshavardhana<br />  After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small</div></blockquote>republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha's death, apparently without<br />any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />into small states. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The</div></blockquote>disintegration of the Harsha's Empire and the chaos created by the<br />power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />  The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the</div></blockquote>decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />part against Muslim invasion. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of</div></blockquote>Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />way, but rivalry between them didn't allow them to maintain a Great<br />Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />India.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />  After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and</div></blockquote>were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />didn't tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />any contacts with Northwest India? <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other</div></blockquote>temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />kind of wars didn't happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn't try their hand<br />to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />  Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler</div></blockquote>of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur's intervention, succeeded<br />in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could</div></blockquote>capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />Rajput hands.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of</div></blockquote>Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga's Rajputs heavily defeated<br />these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />general Silhadi (Shiladitya) to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga's<br />army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />been removed.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been</div></blockquote>apparently different.  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />  Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,</div></blockquote>taking advantage of Humayun's death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />title 'Raja Vikramaditya'.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.</div></blockquote>Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />changed history.<br />    <br />  7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />  The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the</div></blockquote>Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />Vijayanagara.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing</div></blockquote>the defeat in war fled and didn't thought of holding it back, that<br />caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />the last great southern empire in India.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />  The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India</div></blockquote>aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha's power ended, and<br />Ahmad Shah's Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious</div></blockquote>years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thanks,<br />  Dhamo<br />      <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />      <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  Yahoo!

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!
