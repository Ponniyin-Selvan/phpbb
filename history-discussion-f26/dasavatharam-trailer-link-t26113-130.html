			<div class="content">-Hi<br /><br />good.<br />but i dont share your pessimistic view.<br /><br />first of all since i am associated with the chidambaram temple for <br />quite some time i know it evokes more emotions than mny others.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>From your above statement it seems that you are doubting the very<br />  incident itself, inspite of Ottakoothar confirming it with his<br />  ThakkayAgabharani.</div></blockquote>dont you beleive poets. they end up saying something else when they <br />mean other things.<br /><br />i have a very great beleif in the similarities between thiruvengadu <br />and chidambaram. <br />the previous one near the confluence of kaveri and the sea is called <br />aadi chidambaram and is mentioned by valmiki as swetharanyam<br />the re is also a natrajar there in a similar shrine of almost the <br />same dimensions (but right now his importance is taken away by agora <br />murthy.<br /><br />the temple also has a kali with a broken neck as a result of a <br />difficult move in a dance competition with shiva)<br />what I am arrving at is at some point the structure of this temple <br />and chidambaram must have been very alike.<br />the temple complex also has a vishnu shrine. a small one.<br />i guess the original shrine in thillai must have also been of the <br />same proportions and in the outer parikrama ( where the mulattanavar <br />is also present)<br />there seems no opposition when achuta rayar re installed a new <br />govindaraja within the outer parikrama in 1530 or so. the <br />dheekshithars must have been thankful that vijaynagar built for them <br />a rajagopuram and repaired the whole temple.<br />it was when the kondama naicken tried to do it in the inner parikrama <br />that they have protested.<br />also if you observe the structure of the temples in thillai you will <br />feel the architecture is a little unbalanced and lopsided.<br />where natraja faces south what must have been a wide hall in front  <br />of him, only half exists. the other half taken by the govinda rajar <br />shrine.<br />i guess the original govindarajar must have been where the thaayar <br />shrine is now very next to the very important nadana sabhai.<br />also the only side with a walled up entrance is next to this . the <br />south entrance to the main temple is walled up for some reason. it <br />even has a nandi outside.<br />so chidambaram temple must be holding more secrets than those that <br />will be unraveled in our life times.<br />i will add a sketch of the inner shrine in our pictures folder soon.<br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br />And regarding the Vaishnavite followers <br />following<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>suit, you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave their<br />  voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues. They &#40;we&#41; are <br />a very<br />  silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan Andalum oru kavalayum<br />  illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I would say. Like wise, <br />those<br />  Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road sides and cried <br />out. A<br />  Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi and a similar few <br />are all<br />  but exception to this. Also from the date line of 1127 AD when this<br />  incident is supposed to have happened Ramanuja was already old at <br />110<br />  years of age and Koorathazhwan had passed away. So we can only <br />expect<br />  the Vaishnvaites to follow, but CANNOT CONCLUDE.<br />  <br />  And for the records I am not disagreeing with the probability of a<br />  similar character like Rangaraja Nambi to have existed. Only that <br />it<br />  finds no record in the history.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  <br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Hi<br />   <br />    so what venkatesh????<br />    fiction writers are given a huge allowance<br />    the reason we are all here is because of kalki and didnt he make <br />a<br />    great use of that licence.<br />    imagine a flower boy and a boat girl on karikalans throne.it <br />happened<br />    in ponniyin selvan.<br />   <br />    IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of his<br />    vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either <br />voluntarily or<br />    by force.<br />    the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace is an<br />    example of those cruel times.<br />   <br />    i am sure there must have been atleast one person like kamal&#39;s<br />    charecter. and from the accounts of sri vaishnavism that i know <br />there<br />    is no dearth of dedicated followers. kamal has not gone against <br />the<br />    spirit of the event.<br />   <br />    what we were discussing here was the background settings. before <br />it<br />    became one of the most knowledgable discussions of the event.<br />    venketesh<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "vinjamoor_venkatesh" vinjamoor_venkatesh@ wrote: <br />     <br />      That is precisely what I said as, the Rangaraja Nambi character<br />      finds no mention in any of the Traditional Srivaishnavite <br />accounts.<br />      He is very correct.<br />     <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Venkatesh CR<br />       wrote: <br />       <br />        Dear friends,<br />       <br />        This is another write up on what is being discussed here: <br />       <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://madhavipanthal.blogspot.com/2008/05/kamal-haasan-his-">http://madhavipanthal.blogspot.com/2008 ... aasan-his-</a><!-- m --><br />      naked-lies.html<br />       <br />        Regards,<br />       <br />        Venky<br />       <br />       <br />        ---------------------------------<br />        Connect with friends all over the world.

			<div class="content">Mr Venketesh,<br /><br />Sorry I missed this one in my last post.<br /><br />=================Quote===================<br />dont you beleive poets. they end up saying something else when they <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>mean other things.<br />================Unquote==================</div></blockquote><br />Agreed. But in the context of the present discussion, what could be <br />the "other things" that the poet possibly meant to convey with those <br />words, which rather gives direct account of the incident. <br /><br />Also remember, this finds place in the Guruparampara prabhavam as <br />well. The reason for taking Ottakoothar for help is to only convey <br />that the King's own poet and contemporary had confirmed this act, <br />even if the Vaishnavite Guruparampara Prabhavam is to be discarded on <br />the reasons of being a sectarian work. <br /><br />And lastly, the poets are not always liars, especially when they are <br />praising the deeds of their kings. They, at best, only exaggerate. <br />Logically even assuming that Ottakoothar had lied here, why would he <br />need to do this and whom to please. If to please the king, then it is <br />very much obvious that the King shares the views of intolerance <br />expressed by the poet. Otherwise, the King would have condemned such <br />a verse, which would bring a certain disrepute to him.

			<div class="content">That is what we should do for each and every thread if the information<br />is spread across messages. We should form a focus team, which will<br />take care of it by going through the messages, extract the info and<br />create a single message as summary. Otherwise it will be become<br />tedious task to visit it after sometime and by that time we might have<br />lost the context.

Only<br />  that<br />      it<br />        finds no record in the history.<br />       <br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Venkat2, my humble stance is that 'sthala puranam' and<br />history can be totally unrelated. The basic problem in<br />our times is that there is only ONE way of<br />understanding everything - that is if it<br />historically/literally happened, the opposite of any<br />literal truth is a lie, in fact it is a sad problem of<br />modern times that even the word 'myth' itself often<br />means a lie. Myth is not a lie, myth is an allegorical<br />truth, or a story written to communicate truths that<br />do not go well if we say in plain literal forms.<br /><br />Spiritual gurus/masters often used myths or<br />allegorical truths to communicate great wisdom.<br />Whether Narasimha was pacified by Shiva or Prahlada<br />himself is hardly the point, the point is that the<br />story has something to say about ourselves regarding<br />anger and pacification.<br /><br />This link offers what James Joyce thought on Ulysses,<br />a western myth, in a similar way.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm">http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/s ... 260200.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It offends orthodox religious believers and unorthodox<br />people who enjoy fighting these things that it need<br />not be a literal truth. But as long as we stick to<br />saying it is literal (because we think all non<br />literals are lies) we will be left with such dilemmas<br />that is all.<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- vinjamoor_venkatesh<br /> wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Smt Malathi,<br /> <br />  That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite<br />  Perspective. It was true<br />  that no one was even able to near Narasimha due to<br />  the heat<br />  generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />  Lakshmi, who is the<br />  embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />  go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />  Prahaladha himself to<br />  go forward and bring down the "ugram" of Narasimha.<br />  On seeing the<br />  innocent &#40;did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />  greatest Bhaktha&#41;<br />  face of the child Prahaladha, &#40;for whose cause,<br />  Vishnu took the<br />  Narasimha Avatar&#41; Narasimha cooled down and only<br />  then Lakshmi was<br />  able to near Him.<br /> <br />  This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram of<br />  Periya Thirumozhi<br />  by Thirumangai Azhwar.<br /> <br />  paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or Ayira<br />  nAmam<br />  oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr poRuppilanAgi<br />  piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />  piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />  theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi kaNDEnE!!<br /> <br />  Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above, clearly<br />  says that<br />  the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />  Prahaladha.<br /> <br />  Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but the<br />  SthalapuraNams.<br />  The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />  probability based<br />  on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />  sthalapuraNams never go<br />  well with the History. One will notice that 95% of<br />  the kings<br />  mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />  mention anywhere in<br />  History. There are a very handful of divyadesams,<br />  whose<br />  sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />  matching with<br />  History. Srirangam for one is much better as can be<br />  seen from the<br />  Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu".<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />  Mahadevan<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Venkat2, whatever little I know from my<br />  grandmother,<br />    Narasimha&#39;s anger was not appeased even after<br />  killing<br />    Hiranya so Parvati or Shiva decided to confront<br />  the<br />    lion &#40;not exactly Vishnu&#41;.<br />   <br />    I agree with what you say that many stories may<br />  have<br />    been invented as marketing tactics for the temple.<br />    There are several stories like that about Shiva<br />  too<br />    &#40;The mohini basmasura tale where Shiva takes<br />  refuge in<br />    Vishnu to save him&#41;.<br />   <br />    Personally I have found them interesting and<br />  useful<br />    for their morals and similes to some situation<br />    spiritual or otherwise.If we look at them as<br />    independant tales not some correlation on a<br />  larger<br />    scale it may make some sense.<br />   <br />    Malathi<br />    --- vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />     wrote: <br />   <br />      Mr Vijay<br />     <br />      You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu<br />      getting ostracised<br />      by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or<br />  ThiruvIzhimizhalai<br />      legend and vice<br />      versa are, in my humble opinion, at best<br />  fictitious.<br />      I, for one, do<br />      not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which<br />      associates an<br />      ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as<br />  recently<br />      as 150 years<br />      ago.<br />     <br />      I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and<br />  they<br />      were showing about<br />      the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is<br />  very<br />      well know that it<br />      was built during the times of Kulothunga I and<br />  he<br />      built it during<br />      his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But<br />      immediately the presenter<br />      started associating some PuraNa which did<br />  mention<br />      about a PerumAL<br />      being present there. How!!!??? How in the world<br />  is<br />      this possible.<br />     <br />      Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny.<br />  It<br />      is said that Siva<br />      took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu.<br />  First<br />      of all what is<br />      the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of<br />      Narasimha to protect his<br />      own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His<br />  mission.<br />      What was the<br />      need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe<br />  some<br />      motive and accept<br />      it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the<br />      legend of Pratyangira<br />      becoming famous and more with the visits of<br />  ex-CM JJ<br />      to the temple in<br />      Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is<br />      that, Parvathi or<br />      Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed<br />      Narasimha. My God!!! If<br />      the husband has killed a person earlier, why<br />  would<br />      the wife need to<br />      take another form to kill the same person and<br />  again<br />      what is the<br />      motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"?<br />     <br />      It is just that our ancestors who framed all<br />  these<br />      stories wanted to<br />      ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by<br />  way<br />      of a SthalapurANam<br />      so that the temple can be glorified. Really<br />  funny<br />      marketing tactics.<br />     <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />     <br />      PS: Just for the records, the number of<br />      Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite<br />      temples that associate Siva with it are too less<br />      compared to that of<br />      the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with<br />      worshipping Siva at<br />      those temples.
