			<div class="content">Dear Sir,<br /><br />My points were just an observation of what Mr. sampath had mailed<br />quoting a book written by somebody.. but i wud stil putforth certain<br />points.<br /><br />1. RajaRajaChozhan Yes was one of the greatest kings that<br />tamizhagam ever produced.. but whether He is the King of Kings is a<br />point which needs to be deserved..... as u said earlier a concise<br />work on the factual happennings are not yet recorded and a lot needs<br />to be discovered..Rajendra think is better than rajaraja in<br />expanding the kingdom<br /><br />2. No iam not saying that a point which has not been discovered is<br />not true.. what i mean is that it is a question of debate...<br /><br />3. My feeling is that there has been an aura of invincibility<br />created around Rajaraja by people like Kalki and other writers which<br />we are following..<br /><br />4. Request you to kindly recollect the controversies surrounding who<br />the real mamalla is.. People thought it was Narasimhavarma Pallavan<br />I and now people talk of Rajasimhan as mamalla... iam not disputing<br />the claim that bigtemple has been built by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. what is mean is that<br />Kalki's hand is behind a lot of things behind <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> owes a lot to<br />Kalki<br /><br />5. Whether he built the temple for the massess is a question next.<br />had he really been intersted in people worshipping , i think as a<br />prudent ruler <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> wud have built lot of temples in his entire land<br />and not in tanjai alone.. as u said earlier he is a clear egoist...<br /><br />6. Iam not an expert and i cannot deny that he allowed his people to<br />use his name .. but was that real??? u might recall the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> movie<br />by sivaji ganesan wherein he was holding a spitton for a<br />sthapathi... was itt rue??<br /><br />Pls let me know whether the things as allowing somebody to use the<br />name and is proved beyond doubt when people still question the<br />administration capability of Cholas???<br /><br />as rightly pointed out by Mr. Venkatesh, Pandyas as a race have been<br />there for long.. cholas were so obsessed with madurai and lot of<br />pattapeyars had madurantakan ... during wars the inscriptions of<br />pandyas the great deeds of pandyas might have been ruined .... and<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> since a recent king ( around 1000 years back) might be<br />standing... just because one does not find a glorifying inscription<br />of Pandya or say any other king for that matter , doesnt denigrade<br />the other Kings<br /><br />as u said earlier, lot of works are not comprehensive and before<br />things are proved beyond a point i think the question " whether or<br />not he deserves to be a egoist" till date has no answer.<br /><br />But one thing is absolutely clear .. He was at his best in<br />Brandbuilding or Public Relations.. his PR agent in recent times<br />being Kalki.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Dhiwakar" <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    sampath ji,<br />   <br />    enna solla vareenga... appadinaa RajaRajaChozhan was a vehement<br />    supporter of Caste based discrimination that he wanted people of<br />    supposedly higher caste to serve him....<br />   <br />    may be ...

No iam not saying that a point which has not been discovered is<br />  not true.. what i mean is that it is a question of debate...<br /> <br />  3. My feeling is that there has been an aura of invincibility<br />  created around Rajaraja by people like Kalki and other writers<br />which<br />  we are following..<br /> <br />  4.

Whether he built the temple for the massess is a question next.<br />  had he really been intersted in people worshipping , i think as a<br />  prudent ruler <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> wud have built lot of temples in his entire land<br />  and not in tanjai alone.. as u said earlier he is a clear egoist...<br /> <br />  6.

			<div class="content">Dear Rajendra cholan,<br /><br />The question here is did he really possess those attributes or just<br />extra fittings???<br /><br />to my knowledge <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had done only two wars in his lifetime....

			<div class="content">Of course it is customary to prefix "Dr." before a doctor's name,<br />followed by his credentials.
