			<div class="content">Dear SPS ,Gokul,VK and others<br />Have been to Lithuania and have just comeback hence the delay in response....<br />Time flies Has it been a year since we have been having Varalaru...<br /><br />I was speaking to a freind from Tirenelveli who is now in Japan who said a japanese profeesor strongly believed linguistic relations between Tamil,Finnish and Japanese!!!<br /><br />There are a few things which I think we need to address....<br /><br />We have in the past have had money matters with a mixture of reaction but I think we have outgrown our dreams and have to look at things in a different perspective....<br /><br />I thing we need to register ourselves as a charity organisation.....<br />'TAMIL VARALARU SANGAM/SOCIETY'<br />It has its advantages...<br /><br />1)Then all our activities are taken more seriously<br />2)We would have credibility<br />3) Contributions could then be accounted than personal contributions....and have tax relief ...more so in the case of people like SPS,Gokul and Kamal who travel and spend so much theose expentiures would also have a tax relief.<br />4) The seminars and meetings can be organised with a registration fees<br />5) We would neet an accountant and annual reports I am sure one of the business people with money matters can easyly do that<br /><br />I would urge you all to visit the following website<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/">http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />English heritage preserves English monument, charges a membership fees and once youre a member you get free access to all their sites...<br />And you get tax relief for your membership<br /><br /><br />Second Ponniyin Selvan Celebrations<br />I couldnt agree with you more for suggesting a celebration...I can only be there in spirit till akil grows a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more Its sad I was coming to Madras everyyear til my involvement with you all started and now I havent come for nearly 2 years<br />Sadayam will be a great day..but Big temple will be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> crowded...<br /><br />Unveiling Gokul's Digital recreations.<br />Gokul you might want to start the exhibition.soon I dont know if its already there already important thing is charging people for it Indians atleast 20Rs and Foreigners 5-10 USD<br /><br />Virtual Tour of Periya Koil<br />SPS you might be able to pull this off easily with your <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> connections not all except a few have seen the inside of the Meru..<br />We could have a virtual tour of the same either as a movie of the ascent with emphasis on the painting restoration techniques etc. All we need is a dark room a projector and a good quality narrotor each show could be charged at 50Rs and 20USD mind you this will attract people because you cannot see this normally<br />Second is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> more sophesticated.....Having three D movie with specaila goggles to give a virtual ascent<br /><br />Making of the Periya Koil<br />Again a movie of how it was constructed What was used where were the stonews from the legends and myths etc...<br /><br />Thats what will make tis a great sucess from the public point of view....<br /><br />Those are all my positive feedback I do have a negative one As always someone has to be a devils advocate....<br /><br />Are we not moving away from a paperless society...Do we really want Malars and Books Does the publication cost justify the expenditure....Would it not be a better idea to convert them as PDFs and people can see them online or save to disks?<br /><br /><br />I think SPS we need Brown boards in Tamilnadu...<br /><br />A brown board signifies historic monument ...It could be anything from Bigtemple to Ripon building All the board will say is Historic Tamilnadu ( Varalatru Thalam)<br /><br />In Thanjavur for instance you will have boards welcoming you to Historic Thanjai....As you come into Town You will have signboards saying Periya Koil Historic Thanjai and a arrow and distance<br />Aranmanai Historic Thanjai<br />Keelvasal Historic Thanjai<br />Saraswathi Mahal Historic Thanjai So people will be driven towards areas of historic importnace<br /><br />Same with Pallipadais....<br /><br />A old church<br />mosque...but the problem with mosques and some temples is they will not admit people inside usually but atleast they can be seen from outside.<br /><br />Maybe a special sign for padal pettra thalam or divyadesam<br /><br />Like if I am correct the first christian missionary school was in thanjavur St Antonys complex<br /><br />This is a borad welcoming you to oford stating that it has museum,Catherdral,and playhouses<br /><br />on the same note thanjavur will have museum sign, temple sign ,palace sign, so on...<br />it should be done to all the towns with historic background including battlefields...Thakkolam,Thalayalanaganam,Venni<br /><br />What do you all think<br /><br />Regards<br />Sri<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a

(Late) Dr.Rasamanickanar is the<br />father of Dr.Kalaikkovan - author of Pallavar varalaaru and other<br />famous History books. Presently Dr. RMHRC is also publishing<br />VARALAARU Hard copy bi-monthly - which is viewed as an Authentic<br />Historical Document by several Scholars.<br /><br />Those who are following the e-issues month by month are bound to<br />notice the development of talent in each of them (team members) and<br />their improvement in ability to share informations with clarity, ease<br />& precise. Not a single data of varalaaru.com is refuted by any<br />Historical Scholar so far in these 12 months span!. Majority of<br />them are reading them with intereset and appreciation.<br /><br />Apart from sharing Historical informations and writing "Rajakesari",<br />Mr. Gokul has exhibited his talent in reconstructing Tanjore temple<br />paintings of Rajaraja period. He is the youngest - shall we say<br />History Researcher - to render the Lecture and Live Demonstration -<br />honoured by Dr. Kalaikkovan - under the auspicious of Dr. Kura<br />Sreenivasan Trust - Guru of Iravatham Mahadevan - in January 2005,<br />which is well appreciated by Dr. Kalaikkovan, Dr. Nalini, Dr. Akila,<br />Dr. Lalithambal, Dr. Rajavelu, Dr. Kudavoil Balu and Vellayampattu<br />Sundaram of Sekar Pathipagam - which specialises in publishing<br />History Books - on the dias and by Dr. Sathiamurthy of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> - in his<br />office in repeat demonstration at Chennai. Prior to Gokul, Dr.<br />Iravatham, Dr. Sathiamurthy have rendered such lectures to the<br />Scholar studded audience in earlier years.. Those who were present -<br />including myself, Lavanya, Kamal, Krupa , Ram, Satish & Sankaran have<br />shed tears in happiness and ecstacy in the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> Complex, Tanjore Big<br />temple.<br /><br />This forum "Ponniyinselvan yahoo Group" is the Mother of such great<br />children and we all take pride that our group is able to accomplish<br />such feats. Dr. Sridhar and other overseas members have also shared<br />their happiness on such accomplishments.<br /><br />Now we can plan a couple of things : IDENTIFY A PONNIYINSELVAN DAY -<br />either the Day on which our Group was incorporated or AIPPASI<br />SADHAYAM (Natal star of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>) and chalk out some programme every year<br />related to all group activities with a meet and Seminar.<br /><br />Varalaaru.com day - devoted to Tamil Varalaaru - in particular.<br /><br />Some of us have been contributing privately Rs. 1000 per month to<br />bring out certain Historical Research Books - the first of<br />which "Penn Deyva Vazhipaadu" was also written and released by<br />Dr.Kalaikkovan in Jan 05. Another activity of the team.<br /><br />Let us see whether it is possible to include more members in the team<br />so that we can work towards bringing out unpublished inscriptions /<br />tabulising and putting them in the search mode for speedy reference<br />etc.<br /><br />New talents, who can allocate some attention and time, need to<br />strengthen our team.<br /><br />I take this opportunity to request our members to go through<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="../../www.varalaaru.com/index.html">http://www.varalaaru.com</a><!-- w --> issues whenever they find time and opine.<br /><br />anbudan, sps<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Yahoo!

SPS can take it forward.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Are we not moving away from a paperless society...Do we really<br />want Malars and Books Does the publication cost justify the</div></blockquote><br />This is what even I thought till one of my very close friends with<br />great interest in reading varalaaru.com - with no internet<br />connection at home - told me this :<br /><br />"It takes Rs.20 for one hour in internet centre. Varalaaru.com<br />cannot be read so fast so I need atleast 2-3 hours. I have to spend<br />Rs.60 and it becomes a burden sometimes..."<br /><br />This is the reality. The only reason i am convinced with paper stuff<br />is that we will be reaching people with little or no access to<br />Internet. Once they come to know of our existence may be atleast<br />some of them will become regular visitors. That is the only<br />inspiration<br /><br />Rgds<br />G</div>
