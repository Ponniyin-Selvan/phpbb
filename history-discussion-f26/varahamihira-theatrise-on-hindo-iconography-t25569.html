			<div class="content">varAhamihira was a medieval Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the <br />500s of the CE era. He may have descended from a family of <br />shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as suggested by the mihira epithet in his name <br />combined with varAha. This is also suggested by his tendencies for <br />solar-system worship which appears to have been a trait of the <br />shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian Hindu brahmins. He covers an <br />extraordinary range of topics in his encyclopedic works ranging from <br />astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana jAtaka-s, sooth-saying of <br />various kinds, and worship of Hindu gods through idols. In the same <br />breadth he introduces some of the best know trigonometric formulae <br />like sinx^2 + cosx^2 = 1; the double angle expansions like cos2*x=1-<br />2*sinx^2 as well as the basics of Hindu iconography. Thus, it is not <br />suprising when we find trigonmetry mensuration and agamic issues <br />pertain to idols being linked even the works of the later day <br />nambutiri mathematician and tantric Chennas Narayanan Nambutiripad.<br /><br />In his bR^ihat saMhitA he gives a succint section on construction of <br />icons of gods, which gives a good picture of what was the <br />iconographic situation around, 500-600 CE, the culmination of the <br />gupta period. Many of these topics are dealt with in great detail in <br />the purANas and Agamas of the various streams, but varAhamihira's <br />account appears to give a summary of what was popular, such that it <br />can be compared with surviving temples of the period, like the <br />glorious Udayagiri complex.<br /><br />The deities who were iconographically depicted in varAhamihira's <br />times were: 1)rAma the son of dasharatha; 2) bali the son of <br />virochana, the asura. 3) viShNu with 8 arms etc 4) balabhadra or the <br />saMkarShaNa 5) sAmba 6) pradyumna 7) ekAnaMshA (3-7 appear to <br />represent a vaiShNava set parallel to the set expounded in the <br />iconographic chapters of the pA~ncharAtra tantras) 8)4-headed brahmA <br />9) kumAra or skanda 10) indra 11) rudra, holding uma by his side 12) <br />the buddha 13) the naked jain ascetic 14) sUrya 16) li~Nga 17) <br />revanta 18) yama 19) varuNa 20) kubera 21) vinAyaka 22) sapta-<br />mAtR^ika<br /><br />Appended below are the relevant verses along with some notes and my <br />translation (the text follows the one provided freely by Indologist <br />Michio Yano and one published by obscure press in the drAviDa <br />country of which the title pages are worn off):<br /><br />57.30 dasharatha-tanayo rAmo balish cha vairochaniH shataM viMsham <br />57.30 dvAdasha-hAnyA sheShAH pravara-sama-nyUna-parimANAH rAma, son <br />of dasharatha, and bali, son of virochana, should be made 120 <br />[digits tall].

In the same <br />  breadth he introduces some of the best know trigonometric formulae <br />  like sinx^2 + cosx^2 = 1; the double angle expansions like cos2*x=1-<br />  2*sinx^2 as well as the basics of Hindu iconography. Thus, it is not <br />  suprising when we find trigonmetry mensuration and agamic issues <br />  pertain to idols being linked even the works of the later day <br />  nambutiri mathematician and tantric Chennas Narayanan Nambutiripad.<br />  <br />  In his bR^ihat saMhitA he gives a succint section on construction of <br />  icons of gods, which gives a good picture of what was the <br />  iconographic situation around, 500-600 CE, the culmination of the <br />  gupta period. Many of these topics are dealt with in great detail in <br />  the purANas and Agamas of the various streams, but varAhamihira&#39;s <br />  account appears to give a summary of what was popular, such that it <br />  can be compared with surviving temples of the period, like the <br />  glorious Udayagiri complex.<br />  <br />  The deities who were iconographically depicted in varAhamihira&#39;s <br />  times were: 1&#41;rAma the son of dasharatha; 2&#41; bali the son of <br />  virochana, the asura. 3&#41; viShNu with 8 arms etc 4&#41; balabhadra or the <br />  saMkarShaNa 5&#41; sAmba 6&#41; pradyumna 7&#41; ekAnaMshA &#40;3-7 appear to <br />  represent a vaiShNava set parallel to the set expounded in the <br />  iconographic chapters of the pA~ncharAtra tantras&#41; 8&#41;4-headed brahmA <br />  9&#41; kumAra or skanda 10&#41; indra 11&#41; rudra, holding uma by his side 12&#41; <br />  the buddha 13&#41; the naked jain ascetic 14&#41; sUrya 16&#41; li~Nga 17&#41; <br />  revanta 18&#41; yama 19&#41; varuNa 20&#41; kubera 21&#41; vinAyaka 22&#41; sapta-<br />  mAtR^ika<br />  <br />  Appended below are the relevant verses along with some notes and my <br />  translation &#40;the text follows the one provided freely by Indologist <br />  Michio Yano and one published by obscure press in the drAviDa <br />  country of which the title pages are worn off&#41;:<br />  <br />  57.30 dasharatha-tanayo rAmo balish cha vairochaniH shataM viMsham <br />  57.30 dvAdasha-hAnyA sheShAH pravara-sama-nyUna-parimANAH rAma, son <br />  of dasharatha, and bali, son of virochana, should be made 120 <br />  [digits tall].
