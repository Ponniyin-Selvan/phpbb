			<div class="content">The lost empire of the Cholas explored<br />By David Keys<br /><br />Deep in the south of India lie the spectacular remains of one of the <br />world's most remarkable and most forgotten civilsations. In its <br />heyday it was one of the half-dozen greatest powers on Earth. It <br />controlled half a million square miles - more than five times the <br />size of Britain. And under its wing literacy and the arts flourished.<br /><br />Yet today, 1,000 years later, the Chola Empire is remembered only by <br />a handful of specialist historians.<br /><br />If it had been European, or had given its name to some still-<br />surviving nation, things might be different. But despite 400 years of <br />glory, the Chola Empire disappeared from history; a sad fate for a <br />civilisation which was among the most remarkable produced by the <br />medieval world.<br /><br />In some ways, it was the most significant of the dozen or so empires <br />which rose and fell during India's long, tumultuous history. It <br />lasted some 460 years, longer than any of them. The Chola was also <br />the only Asian empire (bar the Japanese) to have indulged, albeit <br />briefly, in overseas expansion. It conquered Sri Lanka, the Andaman <br />and Nicobar islands and, temporarily, parts of south-east Asia - the <br />islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali, and the southern part of the Malay <br />peninsula.<br /><br /><br />Most of these overseas conquests are shrouded in mystery. All that is <br />known is that, in 1025, the Chola emperor Rajendra I dispatched an <br />army, presumably on a large fleet, across 2000 miles of ocean to <br />conquer the southern half of south-east Asia. The records show that <br />he succeeded and received the submission of large numbers of cities. <br />Some historians believe that the Cholas then simply sailed back to <br />India, but others suspect that Chola power persisted in some form in <br />south-east Asia for two or three generations.<br /><br />Certainly, the Chola conquest contributed to a long process that had <br />already started and which linked southern India and south-east Asia <br />together in terms of trade and religion. The Indonesia/Malay region <br />was a pivotal point in trade between China and India (and, indeed, <br />the West), and both Java and Bali were largely Hindu. Rajendra's <br />conquest was perhaps the first military expression of a more general <br />connection which had been developing for centuries.<br /><br />Closer to home, in Sri Lanka, the Cholas' overseas expansion is <br />better documented, both in text, and in stone. Tourists today can <br />still explore the great ruined city of Polonnaruva, founded by the <br />Cholas as a capital for their newly conquered island territory.<br /><br />But the emperor's armies didn't only head southwards. In the early <br />11th century, Chola forces marched almost 1000 miles through India to <br />the banks of the Ganges. Like the south-east Asian conquest, this <br />epic ''long march'' is also shrouded in mystery. Whether the <br />emperor's objectives in marching an army<br />to the sacred river were political or purely religious is unknown.<br /><br />Certainly, the north of India, though temporarily subdued, was not <br />incorporated into the empire - although holy Ganges water was carried <br />back to a great new capital named in honour of the sacred river, and <br />the ruler who had conquered it.<br /><br />This capital was called Gangaikondacholapuram - literally ''the City <br />to which the Chola emperor brought the Ganges''. At the centre of <br />their new metropolis, the Cholas built a magnificent temple and a <br />vast three mile-long reservoir symbolically to hold the ''captured'' <br />waters of the Ganges. <br /><br />Both have survived. Under Chola rule, religion and politics grew ever <br />closer together, with the emperor projecting himself as the <br />representative, almost a manifestation, of God on Earth. Large <br />temples were built, for the first time, as royal establishments. The <br />Cholas probably built more temples than any other Indian kingdom or <br />empire. <br /><br />Each temple was a masterpiece. Even today, the Chola heartland - <br />along the Kaveri River in the state of Tamil Nadu - is full of <br />beautiful, delicately carved temples, some the size of tiny chapels, <br />others as big as European cathedrals. In the very centre of what was <br />the empire, there are still 40 Chola temples in an area half the size <br />of greater London. The most spectacular structure is the 63m-high <br />pyramid- shaped centralshrine in the city of Thanjavur, the Chola <br />capital before Gangaikondacholapuram.<br /><br />Chola art and architecture were among the finest in the world. <br />Indeed, in cast bronze sculpture and hard-stone sculpture, Chola art <br />is unsurpassed. Millions of figures, deftly carved in granite, can <br />still be seen on their temples, while in museums, in Thanjavur and <br />Madras, visitors can marvel at the artistry and craftsmanship of the <br />bronze figurines and statues.<br /><br />The Cholas not only nurtured an artistic boom; they also fostered a <br />massive expansion in education. Political stability and imperial <br />grants - both to the temples which ran education and to the students <br />themselves - led to the expansion of local schools and elite colleges <br />for higher castes. <br /><br />The education system - which operated from a religious perspective <br />but also promoted literacy, mathematics and astronomy - was probably, <br />at least in part, responsible for the development of a competent <br />imperial administration and broadened international horizons. Some <br />estimates suggest that literacy rose to around 20 per cent - perhaps <br />the highest in the medieval world.<br /><br />An unplanned result of this high level of education was an increase <br />in intellectual dissidence. One of the greatest Indian religious <br />thinkers - the 11th-century philosopher Ramanuja - was a product of <br />the Chola empire, although he was ultimately expelled for his views. <br />In many ways, he can be seen as the founder of Hindu monotheism with <br />his belief in a unitary personal god, the ultimate font of love and <br />compassion.<br /><br />In the 12th century there flourished an even more dissident religious <br />movement. The Lingayats professed a sort of cynical humanism which <br />questioned the very fundamentals of religion - the authority of <br />India's holy books, the Vedas (the equivalent of the Bible), and <br />reincarnation itself. Socially, they were also radical, challenging <br />the taboo on widows re-marrying, and condemning child marriages. This <br />dissident movement derived much support from the lower castes.<br /><br />The empire also increased the importance and institutionalisation of <br />local government. Each group of five to 10 villages had an elected <br />district council, which in turn had endless sub-committees dealing <br />with everything from land rights to irrigation, law and order to food <br />storage. <br /><br />Every household in a district had the right to vote - and the <br />councils enjoyed considerable power. The Chola emperors encouraged <br />their development, probably as a counter-balance to the power of <br />local vassal rulers, who owed obedience to the empire.<br /><br />Although the Cholas ruled for more than four centuries, they did so <br />with a remarkable light touch. Local responsibility for local affairs <br />was encouraged, and newly conquered local rulers were allowed to keep <br />their titles and lands, though under ultimate Chola control.<br /><br />The light touch was brought even to waging war. The Cholas <br />exemplified the Indian principle of war - the dharma yuddha, <br />literally, the principle of the fair fight. <br /><br />Battles were normally pre- arranged and fought in daylight on a level <br />field between equal numbers of troops. Defeated princes could carry <br />on living and prospering, but had to pay homage and cough up tribute <br />for the emperor's treasury and women to act as concubines<br />and courtiers.<br /><br />Presiding over this mixture of autocracy and democracy, a cocktail of <br />religious orthodoxy and dissidence, and a surge of artistic <br />creativity - not to mention their concubines - the Chola emperors <br />considered themselves the rulers of the world. They did, of course, <br />look on India as the Continent of the Cosmos.<br /><br />Yet now they are forgotten, their achievements ignored by the world. <br />There is not one book in print on the Chola Empire; nor a travel-<br />company tour to most of their extraordinary temples.<br /><br /><br />About the writer<br /><br />David Keys is archaeology correspondent of the London daily paper The <br />Independent. He is a leading TV archaeological consultant. He has <br />visited over one thousand archaeological sites in sixty countries.</div>

The<br />Cholas probably built more temples than any other Indian kingdom or<br />empire.<br /><br />Each temple was a masterpiece. Even today, the Chola heartland -<br />along the Kaveri River in the state of Tamil Nadu - is full of<br />beautiful, delicately carved temples, some the size of tiny chapels,<br />others as big as European cathedrals. In the very centre of what was<br />the empire, there are still 40 Chola temples in an area half the size<br />of greater London. The most spectacular structure is the 63m-high<br />pyramid- shaped centralshrine in the city of Thanjavur, the Chola<br />capital before Gangaikondacholapuram.<br /><br />Chola art and architecture were among the finest in the world.<br />Indeed, in cast bronze sculpture and hard-stone sculpture, Chola art<br />is unsurpassed. Millions of figures, deftly carved in granite, can<br />still be seen on their temples, while in museums, in Thanjavur and<br />Madras, visitors can marvel at the artistry and craftsmanship of the<br />bronze figurines and statues.<br /><br />The Cholas not only nurtured an artistic boom; they also fostered a<br />massive expansion in education. Political stability and imperial<br />grants - both to the temples which ran education and to the students<br />themselves - led to the expansion of local schools and elite colleges<br />for higher castes.<br /><br />The education system - which operated from a religious perspective<br />but also promoted literacy, mathematics and astronomy - was probably,<br />at least in part, responsible for the development of a competent<br />imperial administration and broadened international horizons. Some<br />estimates suggest that literacy rose to around 20 per cent - perhaps<br />the highest in the medieval world.<br /><br />An unplanned result of this high level of education was an increase<br />in intellectual dissidence. One of the greatest Indian religious<br />thinkers - the 11th-century philosopher Ramanuja - was a product of<br />the Chola empire, although he was ultimately expelled for his views.<br />In many ways, he can be seen as the founder of Hindu monotheism with<br />his belief in a unitary personal god, the ultimate font of love and<br />compassion.<br /><br />In the 12th century there flourished an even more dissident religious<br />movement. The Lingayats professed a sort of cynical humanism which<br />questioned the very fundamentals of religion - the authority of<br />India's holy books, the Vedas (the equivalent of the Bible), and<br />reincarnation itself. Socially, they were also radical, challenging<br />the taboo on widows re-marrying, and condemning child marriages. This<br />dissident movement derived much support from the lower castes.<br /><br />The empire also increased the importance and institutionalisation of<br />local government. Each group of five to 10 villages had an elected<br />district council, which in turn had endless sub-committees dealing<br />with everything from land rights to irrigation, law and order to food<br />storage.<br /><br />Every household in a district had the right to vote - and the<br />councils enjoyed considerable power. The Chola emperors encouraged<br />their development, probably as a counter-balance to the power of<br />local vassal rulers, who owed obedience to the empire.<br /><br />Although the Cholas ruled for more than four centuries, they did so<br />with a remarkable light touch. Local responsibility for local affairs<br />was encouraged, and newly conquered local rulers were allowed to keep<br />their titles and lands, though under ultimate Chola control.<br /><br />The light touch was brought even to waging war. The Cholas<br />exemplified the Indian principle of war - the dharma yuddha,<br />literally, the principle of the fair fight.<br /><br />Battles were normally pre- arranged and fought in daylight on a level<br />field between equal numbers of troops. Defeated princes could carry<br />on living and prospering, but had to pay homage and cough up tribute<br />for the emperor's treasury and women to act as concubines<br />and courtiers.<br /><br />Presiding over this mixture of autocracy and democracy, a cocktail of<br />religious orthodoxy and dissidence, and a surge of artistic<br />creativity - not to mention their concubines - the Chola emperors<br />considered themselves the rulers of the world. They did, of course,<br />look on India as the Continent of the Cosmos.<br /><br />Yet now they are forgotten, their achievements ignored by the world.<br />There is not one book in print on the Chola Empire; nor a travel-<br />company tour to most of their extraordinary temples.<br /><br />About the writer<br /><br />David Keys is archaeology correspondent of the London daily paper The<br />Independent.
