			<div class="content">Shobha,<br /><br />Even I missed the village life, unfortunately that my grand parents were<br />dead by the time I came to this third rock from the sun. Only my maternal<br />grandma was alive and she too died in 1983! She was in Trichy. I haven't<br />frequented to the villages Athigudi (Near Lalgudi, Anbil is not far from<br />there! My Maternal ancestors Anaipatti (Near Dindigul) my Paternal ancestors<br />but have been there for a couple of seasons during my schooling.<br /><br />1. Every day morning me and my cousins would bathe near the motor room<br />where there will be a small pond.<br />2. Heavy Brunch with all the members in the family.<br />3. Ace spade / Literature game after that.<br />4. Adithadi sandai for oonjal as there use to be only one and patti /<br />athai shouting at the top of their voice "Ithana perr oonjala aadinelna ..<br />Utharam Keezha Vizhaporadhu"<br />5. Evening bath at the kenathadi (Minimum 15-20 buckets of water for<br />every person with no idea about water conservation)<br />6. Kovil / Visiting relatives during the Golu. I still remember almost<br />all the family in the agraharam were our relatives. Either they will be<br />Dhayadhi or they will be Sambandhi. In our generation I am supposed to be an<br />expert among my cousin in knowing the relationships. Many of our relatives<br />are related to us in more than two ways. All that is outside the offstump!<br /><br />Today's kids don't even know the exact relations. Couple of years back two<br />of my nephews met in a marriage and one was informing his mother, "Amma<br />yella kalyanathukkum oru paiyyan varuvane avan indha kalyanathukkum vandhu<br />irukkan". After hearing this me and my sisters starting laughing. But that<br />made me think and I started yahoo groups for my family anaipatticousins &<br />aathigudicousins. The new generation daughters in law and sons in law are<br />finding it very easy to understand the relationship. Its a one point contact<br />address for all family updates / nostalgia anecdotes that happened in 1960s<br />and 1970s. Whats surprising is that Chithappas and Mamas are also net savvy<br />now a days and they are also in this group.<br /><br />Udanx ... Manave unnoda manager inikku unna bend kazhatta poraan.
