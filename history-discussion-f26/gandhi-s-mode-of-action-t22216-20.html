The same winston churchil whom you applauded was a drunkard and womanizer, I did not hold that against him, I never will. I dont care...but thats me and a few like me may approve that.<br />epporul yar yar vai ketpin apporul meipporul kaanbathu arivu, lets just say that your words or theories would never deter me but make me more curious to delve into a lot of things to strengthen my belief.<br /><br />If gandhi's obsession with a married woman helped us get our freedom, does it bother you? It does not to me <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />I will again say he was spiritually very evolved, I had earlier mentioned on sexual energy conversion to talent (it was in the thread on child mairrage). I may have a theory...some who know of spiritual progress may attest...Gandhi's evolvement into karma and other areas of spiritual tones may have caused his motivation levels to lead the nation go down, he probably made a pact with karma to mentally use an obsession to build himself up. Though I feel it may not make sense to you, I am compelled to talk this way. An obsession is mental and can produce enough energy and motivation to run around. Sometimes we get motivated listening to Rajini or MGR songs, some people get motivated seeing Kushboo or Simran... honestly does it matter ? How gandhi got rid of the obsession is what makes him different from us. Your defenition of my theory may be termed as 'odd' and something is wrong...but there is a possiblity, someday when I meet him in heaven may be he will disclose to me<br /><img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />There are two types of people my friend, the people type who follow Ramayanam and the people who follow iravana kaviyam... the people who say Jesus was a Saint and God send ...and the people who think he was a joke... the people who say Gandhi was a great man...so on and so forth. Intha charecters ellam vaznthalum eesum vazhalanaalum eesum...vaiyagam ithu thaan <img src="../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As long as the world spins, the balance is natural. I accept that law of nature. However, I personally may read iravana kaviyam to only, in gandhian model, to test my faith.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: R.venketesh <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Monday, November 26, 2007 10:50:55 AM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: gandhi's mode of action<br /><br />hi<br /><br />gandhis last moments were described by the people standing closest to<br />him in the most differing ways.<br />not assumptions based on godse's version.<br />what i am saying is based on a full scale research for a set of books<br />we are planning on gandhi.<br />we are having a book on the salt march by a eminent writer who re<br />enacted the entire march at the age of 70.<br />muruganandam ofcourse has started his work on the godse trial. we<br />hope the book will be explanatory to many who dont know much about<br />those two three years.<br />I think we will do a book on these private life aspects too.

YOu have been seeing only the good of British and the ills of<br />  Indians and thats why you call this mail as a controversy.<br /> <br />  During my college days, I got an oppurtunity to participate in an<br />  eloqution competion held in Wardha, conducted by the Gandhi seva<br />  trust. Topic was about Gandhi. Thats the first time I got an<br />  oppurtunity to read about Gandhi, and ofcourse Freedom at Midnight<br />was<br />  my reference. I read that book for almost two weeks, weeping as I<br />read<br />  through the pages. I got so attached to Gandhi that my friends<br />started<br />  teasing me &#39;pseudo Gandhi&#39;, meaning I am making a drama claiming<br />  myself a fan of Gandhi.<br /> <br />  Later, when i happened to see Kamal&#39;s Hey Ram, I got a new<br />dimension<br />  about Gandhi. Though it was shocking, on further analysis, reading<br />  something about why Godse killed Gandhi, I started realising the<br />other<br />  side of the coin.<br /> <br />  With the information I have, I respect Gandhi for his greatness,<br />the<br />  ahimsa and sathyagraha, the will power he showed, the dedication in<br />  getting India&#39;s freedom etc, but when it comes to Hindu-Muslim<br />unity<br />  and Gandhi&#39;s approach towards it, I do have a bitter taste about<br />him.<br /> <br />  These are facts and we should accept it as it is. Claiming it as<br />  controversy or contradiction is hypocrasy, because facts are facts.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br /> <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "R.venketesh" <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    INTHA VAARAM CONREVERSY VAARAM...... ..</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Never miss a thing.
