			<div class="content">Mr Venketesh,<br /><br />I agree with you here on the Karmic inclinations. But how does that <br />lead to a pessimistic view. I only said that no one opposes anything <br />and keep silent. I never said that it is right or wrong, though I <br />used the word insensitive. It is but true that the internal karmic <br />dependance, exhibits externally as insensitiveness. Hope I am <br />clarifying my point. <br /><br />In fact, philosophically I would say that these insensitive acts of <br />the Vaishnavites and in particular the Thenkalai Vaishnavites are <br />very true to their scriptures as they live the "bhAvam" of "pORRuvAr <br />pORRalum, thURRuvAr thURRalum pOgaTTum kaNNanukkE..". Yes as per the <br />Thenkalai Sampradhayam, there is nothing that a Jeevatma does to <br />earn anything and it is all what He does. Though at the outset is <br />may look like, everyone follows this and not only the Thenkalai <br />Vaishnavites. But the hairline difference is that others do <br />associate "some effort" on the part of jeevAthma, while according to <br />the Thenkalai philosophy even this "some effort" on the part of <br />jeevAthma is refuted. Remember the song from the film Marupadium<br /><br />.... nAyakan mElirundhu nUlinai AattugindRAn, nAmellAm bommai enRu <br />nAdagam kAttuginRAn...<br /><br />Now regarding the correctness of the above philosophy, though I can <br />debate on it, I am sure it will not be in the interest of the group. <br />So let us leave it at that, I mean, that it is the scriptures that <br />the Thenkalais follow. <br /><br />So, in my humble opinion, calling a spade a spade (contextually here <br />the "insensitivity") cannot be termed as pessimism.<br /><br />Humbly yours,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I am sorry I dont understand what is the "pessimism" in my view. <br />    Please do clarify.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  -you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave their<br />      voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues.

They <br />&#40;we&#41; <br />  are <br />      a very<br />        silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan Andalum oru <br />    kavalayum<br />        illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I would say. Like <br />  wise, <br />      those<br />        Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road sides and <br />cried <br />      out. A<br />        Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi and a similar <br />few <br />      are all<br />        but exception to this.

			<div class="content">Smt Malathi,<br /><br />Precisely, that is why I started my reply saying "this is easily <br />contested from a Vaishnavite perspective" and did not start <br />with "Sorry you are wrong and the truth is....."<br /><br />For me, I would not believe the Sarabeswarar Story or the <br />Pratyangira story and the vice versa, will be true for some one else.<br /><br />===================Quote===================<br />the point is that the<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>story has something to say about ourselves regarding<br />  anger and pacification.<br />=================Unquote================</div></blockquote><br />The above is very ideal, if everyone in the world understands the <br />actual reasons, while considering the other characters as metaphors. <br />But, as most people believe everything right from the characters to <br />the intended objectives, one need to be careful in conveying only <br />the correct, logical and rational things, rather than say something <br />without a basis just for competition.<br /><br />One small question in this regard! Cholas were inherently ardent <br />Saivites and either Thillai Natarajan or Thiruvaru Thyagarajan had <br />been their first "kula deivam". It is also noted from the Ennayiram <br />descriptions that Narasimha was indeed the "kula deivam" of <br />Kulothunga I and many other Chola Kings. If the Sarabeswarar legend <br />is true, then why would they want to have the Narasimha form of <br />Vishnu as their kula deivam, as naturally their original kula deivam <br />Siva had ostracised Narasimha form of Vishnu. The Logic here is <br />begging. This is why I used the word "competition" above. If the <br />motive was to exhibit the tolerance limits, they could have as well <br />had other forms like Ranganatha or Venkateswara who had no records <br />of Siva's interference. <br /><br />I leave it here. I had just indicated how I would carry on the <br />discussion to turn down the Sarabeswarar legend, logically. I do not <br />want to continue on this for the fear of hurting others and also it <br />is not in the purview of this group which is basically to discuss on <br />history.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Venkat2, my humble stance is that &#39;sthala puranam&#39; and<br />  history can be totally unrelated.

It was true <br />    that no one was even able to near Narasimha due to<br />    the heat <br />    generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />    Lakshmi, who is the <br />    embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />    go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />    Prahaladha himself to <br />    go forward and bring down the "ugram" of Narasimha.<br />    On seeing the <br />    innocent &#40;did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />    greatest Bhaktha&#41; <br />    face of the child Prahaladha, &#40;for whose cause,<br />    Vishnu took the <br />    Narasimha Avatar&#41; Narasimha cooled down and only<br />    then Lakshmi was <br />    able to near Him.<br />     <br />    This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram of<br />    Periya Thirumozhi <br />    by Thirumangai Azhwar.<br />    <br />    paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or Ayira<br />    nAmam<br />    oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr poRuppilanAgi<br />    piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />    piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />    theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi kaNDEnE!!<br />    <br />    Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above, clearly<br />    says that <br />    the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />    Prahaladha. <br />    <br />    Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but the<br />    SthalapuraNams. <br />    The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />    probability based <br />    on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />    sthalapuraNams never go <br />    well with the History. One will notice that 95% of<br />    the kings <br />    mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />    mention anywhere in <br />    History. There are a very handful of divyadesams,<br />    whose <br />    sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />    matching with <br />    History.

The stories of Vishnu<br />        getting ostracised <br />        by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or<br />    ThiruvIzhimizhalai<br />        legend and vice <br />        versa are, in my humble opinion, at best<br />    fictitious.<br />        I, for one, do <br />        not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which<br />        associates an <br />        ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as<br />    recently<br />        as 150 years <br />        ago. <br />        <br />        I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and<br />    they<br />        were showing about <br />        the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is<br />    very<br />        well know that it <br />        was built during the times of Kulothunga I and<br />    he<br />        built it during <br />        his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But<br />        immediately the presenter <br />        started associating some PuraNa which did<br />    mention<br />        about a PerumAL <br />        being present there. How!!!??? How in the world<br />    is<br />        this possible. <br />        <br />        Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny.<br />    It<br />        is said that Siva <br />        took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu.<br />    First<br />        of all what is <br />        the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of<br />        Narasimha to protect his <br />        own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His<br />    mission.<br />        What was the <br />        need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe<br />    some<br />        motive and accept <br />        it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the<br />        legend of Pratyangira <br />        becoming famous and more with the visits of<br />    ex-CM JJ<br />        to the temple in <br />        Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is<br />        that, Parvathi or <br />        Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed<br />        Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />        the husband has killed a person earlier, why<br />    would<br />        the wife need to <br />        take another form to kill the same person and<br />    again<br />        what is the <br />        motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? <br />        <br />        It is just that our ancestors who framed all<br />    these<br />        stories wanted to <br />        ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by<br />    way<br />        of a SthalapurANam <br />        so that the temple can be glorified. Really<br />    funny<br />        marketing tactics.<br />        <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />        <br />        PS: Just for the records, the number of<br />        Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />        temples that associate Siva with it are too less<br />        compared to that of <br />        the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with<br />        worshipping Siva at <br />        those temples.

			<div class="content">Venkat2, it is impossible for mythical stories to be<br />'rational and logical', be it Sarabeswarar or<br />something else. If we want it that way we might as<br />well throw everything out starting with great epics.<br /><br />I agree with you some stories may have been created<br />for competitive reasons. Most stories are created to<br />convey deeper spiritual truths. If we want to run this<br />political contest in the name of Siva versus Vishnu -<br />I will only take what 'rationally' makes sense and if<br />it supports 'Vishnu' - it is not going to be unlike a<br />political battle between rival political parties.<br />Whether mature devotees, be it of Siva/Vishnu or any<br />deity engage in that is a question for us all.<br /><br />Better stop here too.<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- vinjamoor_venkatesh<br /> wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Smt Malathi,<br /> <br />  Precisely, that is why I started my reply saying<br />  "this is easily<br />  contested from a Vaishnavite perspective" and did<br />  not start<br />  with "Sorry you are wrong and the truth is....."<br /> <br />  For me, I would not believe the Sarabeswarar Story<br />  or the<br />  Pratyangira story and the vice versa, will be true<br />  for some one else.<br /> <br />  ===================Quote===================<br />  the point is that the<br />    story has something to say about ourselves<br />  regarding<br />    anger and pacification.<br />  =================Unquote================<br /> <br />  The above is very ideal, if everyone in the world<br />  understands the<br />  actual reasons, while considering the other<br />  characters as metaphors.<br />  But, as most people believe everything right from<br />  the characters to<br />  the intended objectives, one need to be careful in<br />  conveying only<br />  the correct, logical and rational things, rather<br />  than say something<br />  without a basis just for competition.<br /> <br />  One small question in this regard! Cholas were<br />  inherently ardent<br />  Saivites and either Thillai Natarajan or Thiruvaru<br />  Thyagarajan had<br />  been their first "kula deivam". It is also noted<br />  from the Ennayiram<br />  descriptions that Narasimha was indeed the "kula<br />  deivam" of<br />  Kulothunga I and many other Chola Kings. If the<br />  Sarabeswarar legend<br />  is true, then why would they want to have the<br />  Narasimha form of<br />  Vishnu as their kula deivam, as naturally their<br />  original kula deivam<br />  Siva had ostracised Narasimha form of Vishnu. The<br />  Logic here is<br />  begging. This is why I used the word "competition"<br />  above. If the<br />  motive was to exhibit the tolerance limits, they<br />  could have as well<br />  had other forms like Ranganatha or Venkateswara who<br />  had no records<br />  of Siva&#39;s interference.<br /> <br />  I leave it here. I had just indicated how I would<br />  carry on the<br />  discussion to turn down the Sarabeswarar legend,<br />  logically. I do not<br />  want to continue on this for the fear of hurting<br />  others and also it<br />  is not in the purview of this group which is<br />  basically to discuss on<br />  history.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />  Mahadevan<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Venkat2, my humble stance is that &#39;sthala puranam&#39;<br />  and<br />    history can be totally unrelated.

It is said that even<br />      Lakshmi, who is the<br />      embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />      go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />      Prahaladha himself to<br />      go forward and bring down the "ugram" of<br />  Narasimha.<br />      On seeing the<br />      innocent &#40;did I say that??

			<div class="content">I never had any intention to carry this sub-thread forward and it <br />was clear in my last para. Obviously this thread is also closed from <br />my side.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Venkat2, it is impossible for mythical stories to be<br />  &#39;rational and logical&#39;, be it Sarabeswarar or<br />  something else. If we want it that way we might as<br />  well throw everything out starting with great epics.<br />  <br />  I agree with you some stories may have been created<br />  for competitive reasons. Most stories are created to<br />  convey deeper spiritual truths. If we want to run this<br />  political contest in the name of Siva versus Vishnu -<br />  I will only take what &#39;rationally&#39; makes sense and if<br />  it supports &#39;Vishnu&#39; - it is not going to be unlike a<br />  political battle between rival political parties.<br />  Whether mature devotees, be it of Siva/Vishnu or any<br />  deity engage in that is a question for us all.<br />  <br />  Better stop here too.<br />  <br />  Malathi<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />   wrote: <br />  <br />    Smt Malathi,<br />    <br />    Precisely, that is why I started my reply saying<br />    "this is easily <br />    contested from a Vaishnavite perspective" and did<br />    not start <br />    with "Sorry you are wrong and the truth is....."<br />    <br />    For me, I would not believe the Sarabeswarar Story<br />    or the <br />    Pratyangira story and the vice versa, will be true<br />    for some one else.<br />    <br />    ===================Quote===================<br />    the point is that the<br />      story has something to say about ourselves<br />    regarding<br />      anger and pacification.<br />    =================Unquote================<br />    <br />    The above is very ideal, if everyone in the world<br />    understands the <br />    actual reasons, while considering the other<br />    characters as metaphors. <br />    But, as most people believe everything right from<br />    the characters to <br />    the intended objectives, one need to be careful in<br />    conveying only <br />    the correct, logical and rational things, rather<br />    than say something <br />    without a basis just for competition.<br />    <br />    One small question in this regard! Cholas were<br />    inherently ardent <br />    Saivites and either Thillai Natarajan or Thiruvaru<br />    Thyagarajan had <br />    been their first "kula deivam". It is also noted<br />    from the Ennayiram <br />    descriptions that Narasimha was indeed the "kula<br />    deivam" of <br />    Kulothunga I and many other Chola Kings. If the<br />    Sarabeswarar legend <br />    is true, then why would they want to have the<br />    Narasimha form of <br />    Vishnu as their kula deivam, as naturally their<br />    original kula deivam <br />    Siva had ostracised Narasimha form of Vishnu. The<br />    Logic here is <br />    begging. This is why I used the word "competition"<br />    above. If the <br />    motive was to exhibit the tolerance limits, they<br />    could have as well <br />    had other forms like Ranganatha or Venkateswara who<br />    had no records <br />    of Siva&#39;s interference. <br />    <br />    I leave it here. I had just indicated how I would<br />    carry on the <br />    discussion to turn down the Sarabeswarar legend,<br />    logically. I do not <br />    want to continue on this for the fear of hurting<br />    others and also it <br />    is not in the purview of this group which is<br />    basically to discuss on <br />    history.<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />    Mahadevan <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      Venkat2, my humble stance is that &#39;sthala puranam&#39;<br />    and<br />      history can be totally unrelated. The basic<br />    problem in<br />      our times is that there is only ONE way of<br />      understanding everything - that is if it<br />      historically/literally happened, the opposite of<br />    any<br />      literal truth is a lie, in fact it is a sad<br />    problem of<br />      modern times that even the word &#39;myth&#39; itself<br />    often<br />      means a lie. Myth is not a lie, myth is an<br />    allegorical<br />      truth, or a story written to communicate truths<br />    that<br />      do not go well if we say in plain literal forms.<br />      <br />      Spiritual gurus/masters often used myths or<br />      allegorical truths to communicate great wisdom.<br />      Whether Narasimha was pacified by Shiva or<br />    Prahlada<br />      himself is hardly the point, the point is that the<br />      story has something to say about ourselves<br />    regarding<br />      anger and pacification.<br />      <br />      This link offers what James Joyce thought on<br />    Ulysses,<br />      a western myth, in a similar way.<br />     <br />   <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm">http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/s ... 260200.htm</a><!-- m --><br />      <br />      It offends orthodox religious believers and<br />    unorthodox<br />      people who enjoy fighting these things that it<br />    need<br />      not be a literal truth. But as long as we stick to<br />      saying it is literal &#40;because we think all non<br />      literals are lies&#41; we will be left with such<br />    dilemmas<br />      that is all.<br />      <br />      Malathi<br />      --- vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />       wrote: <br />      <br />        Smt Malathi,<br />        <br />        That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite<br />        Perspective. It was true <br />        that no one was even able to near Narasimha due<br />    to<br />        the heat <br />        generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />        Lakshmi, who is the <br />        embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />        go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />        Prahaladha himself to <br />        go forward and bring down the "ugram" of<br />    Narasimha.<br />        On seeing the <br />        innocent &#40;did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />        greatest Bhaktha&#41; <br />        face of the child Prahaladha, &#40;for whose cause,<br />        Vishnu took the <br />        Narasimha Avatar&#41; Narasimha cooled down and only<br />        then Lakshmi was <br />        able to near Him.<br />         <br />        This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram<br />    of<br />        Periya Thirumozhi <br />        by Thirumangai Azhwar.<br />        <br />        paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or<br />    Ayira<br />        nAmam<br />        oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr<br />    poRuppilanAgi<br />        piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />        piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />        theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi<br />    kaNDEnE!!<br />        <br />        Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above,<br />    clearly<br />        says that <br />        the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />        Prahaladha. <br />        <br />        Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but<br />    the<br />        SthalapuraNams. <br />        The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />        probability based <br />        on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />        sthalapuraNams never go <br />        well with the History. One will notice that 95%<br />    of<br />        the kings <br />        mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />        mention anywhere in <br />        History. There are a very handful of<br />    divyadesams,<br />        whose <br />        sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />        matching with <br />        History. Srirangam for one is much better as can<br />    be<br />        seen from the <br />        Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu". <br />        <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />        Mahadevan <br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          Venkat2, whatever little I know from my<br />        grandmother,<br />          Narasimha&#39;s anger was not appeased even after<br />        killing<br />          Hiranya so Parvati or Shiva decided to<br />    confront<br />    <br />  === message truncated ===<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />        <br />_____________________________________________________________________</div></blockquote>_______________<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br />  know-it-all with Yahoo!
