			<div class="content">Hi Sps<br /><br />I think you should find a way of transmitting the refutal in varalaru<br />.com to MR. Madan.it would also give him a chance to mention his <br />sources.<br />if you write to the magazine concewrned too , they respond quite fast <br />as I learnt last week.<br />on last sunday there was a great article in the hindu on " the first <br />real war of independence" by maruthanayakam, puli thevan and others. <br />authored by S. Muthiah a renowned antiquarian.<br />Rahul and I noted what we thought was an error in that article.( <br />especially because we both are working on a project on yusuf khan <br />saheb alias maruthanayagam.)<br />it was mentioned that kattabommanaik participated in this rebellion.<br />I wrote to the reader's editor of hindu on the error. I told him that <br />when this rebellion was quelled in 1761 kattabomman was only one year <br />old and couldnt have possibly fought in this war.<br />on monday the renowned author responded and quoted his sources.<br />luckily rahul owned one of the books that was quoted as a source.we <br />checked up and this book (first printed a century ago ) does say so.<br />this opens up a possibility that kattabomman's father or even <br />grandfather had rebelled 40 years prior to veerapandyas hanging in <br />kayathar.<br />this is news to many who beleive kattabomman was the first to rebel <br />in his lineage and that too only in his last few years.<br />so again I think you must respond to anandavikadan or mR.

			<div class="content">great work Venkat<br />I totally agree this should be forwarded to vikatan for three reasons<br />1. For madan to defend his statement<br />2.to reach a wider readership<br />3. to actually vindicate our stant<br /><br />Thanks<br />Sri<br /><br />"R.venketesh"  wrote: Hi Sps<br /><br />I think you should find a way of transmitting the refutal in varalaru<br />.com to MR. Madan.it would also give him a chance to mention his<br />sources.<br />if you write to the magazine concewrned too , they respond quite fast<br />as I learnt last week.<br />on last sunday there was a great article in the hindu on " the first<br />real war of independence" by maruthanayakam, puli thevan and others.<br />authored by S. Muthiah a renowned antiquarian.<br />Rahul and I noted what we thought was an error in that article.(<br />especially because we both are working on a project on yusuf khan<br />saheb alias maruthanayagam.)<br />it was mentioned that kattabommanaik participated in this rebellion.<br />I wrote to the reader's editor of hindu on the error. I told him that<br />when this rebellion was quelled in 1761 kattabomman was only one year<br />old and couldnt have possibly fought in this war.<br />on monday the renowned author responded and quoted his sources.<br />luckily rahul owned one of the books that was quoted as a source.we<br />checked up and this book (first printed a century ago ) does say so.<br />this opens up a possibility that kattabomman's father or even<br />grandfather had rebelled 40 years prior to veerapandyas hanging in<br />kayathar.<br />this is news to many who beleive kattabomman was the first to rebel<br />in his lineage and that too only in his last few years.<br />so again I think you must respond to anandavikadan or mR.

			<div class="content">Hi Sri,<br /><br />Yes, but what was the atcual question put forth to Madan? Was it the later Muvendars? Then Cheras are not point to mention here, as it was Ay Kings inMalabar at that time. <br /><br />Early muvendars, we have only literary proof, which needs to be taken with a pinch of salt and as rightly what Kamal points filter off the chaff from the actual acheivements and locate underlying historical event. Chronology has been difficult in pin-pointing the period and age to which a king couldbe pointed to. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Nanda<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: sridhar rathinam <br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Friday, 30 March, 2007 10:28:15 AM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: madans answer in anandavikadan<br /><br />Dear Nanda<br />Just shows you think with your head and not your heart well done<br />However there is enough evidence on the later cholas and pandiyas..so he doesnt have to be dismissive is my humble opinion<br />regards<br />SRi<br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />Looking at Mrs. Kalavathy's response and I am with her in this controversy.I have no doubts that as a society we are as old as humanity is, but credible evidence does not seem to be showing up for the period before 100BC.

			<div class="content">Sometimes Madan himself was stupid as he said Y2K is<br />roman number when some reader asked about Y2K during<br />1998-99. Actually its Year 2000(Year 2 Kilo and<br />Kilo=1000 in Greek).<br /><br />Its Buddhi Thadumatram(Mind confusion).<br /><br />Chola empire was proven thing and many many historians<br />acknowledged that.<br /><br />Madan made such blabberings though he born/raised in<br />Thanjavur itself, he seen the big temple everyday and<br />Kallanai was near to him before he arrived Chennai.<br /><br />Even today if he travels to Thanjavur/Kumbakonam, he<br />can not be missed seeing Gangaikonda Cholapuram.<br /><br />So definitely his mind confused.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- sridhar rathinam <br />wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Nanda<br />  Just shows you think with your head and not your<br />  heart well done<br />  However there is enough evidence on the later cholas<br />  and pandiyas..so he doesnt have to be dismissive is<br />  my humble opinion<br />  regards<br />  SRi<br /> <br />  Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />  wrote:<br />  Looking at Mrs. Kalavathy&#39;s response and I am with<br />  her in this controversy. I have no doubts that as a<br />  society we are as old as humanity is, but credible<br />  evidence does not seem to be showing up for the<br />  period before 100BC. We do have very ancient sites<br />  like the one near Gummidipoondi, Dr. Sirimoney&#39;s<br />  works point to lots of Iron age settlements and what<br />  not. Credible evidence is something everyone keeps<br />  asking about, do we know when we would have actually<br />  had Karikalan rule over the chola kingdom, no dates,<br />  we will not be able to come up with that.<br /> <br />  Unquestionable evidence makes everyone stand up and<br />  take notice, that is something that we need to<br />  ponder about. Chola pass could be a mis-nomer just<br />  like the Cholula Indians&#40;do we have common linkages<br />  here?&#41; Or is that the Cholas are Persians in origin?<br />  I thought the Pallavas have been thought to be of<br />  Persianic in origin.
