'Conquerors <br />of Enemies,' i.e., Jinas). Salutation to all the Siddhas. By <br />illustrious Kharavela, the Aira (Aila), the Great King, the <br />descendant of Mahameghavahana, the increaser (of the glory) of the <br />Cheti (Chedi) dynasty, (endowed) with excellent and auspicious marks <br />and features, possessed of virtues which have reached (the ends of) <br />the four quarters, overlord of Kalinga,<br /><br />(L. 2) for fifteen years, with a body ruddy and handsome were <br />played youthsome sport; after that (by him who) had mastered (royal) <br />correspondence, currency, finance, civil and religious laws (and) who <br />had become well-versed in all (branches) of learning, for nine years <br />(the office of) Yuvaraja (heir apparent) was administered. Having <br />completed the twenty-fourth year, at that time, (he) who had been <br />prosperous (vardhamana) since his infancy (?) and who (was destined) <br />to have wide conquests as those of Vena,<br /><br />(L. 3) then in the state of manhood, obtains the imperial <br />(maharajya) coronation in the dynasty of Kalinga. As soon as he is <br />anointed, in the first (regnal) year (he) causes repairs of the <br />gates, the walls and the buildings (of the city), (which had been) <br />damaged by storm; in the city of Kalinga (he) causes the erection of <br />the embankments of the lake (called after) Khibira Rishi, (and) of <br />(other) tanks and cisterns, (also) the restoration of all the gardens <br />(he) causes to be<br /><br />(L. 4) done at (the cost of) thirty-five-hundred-thousands, <br />and (he) gratifies the People. And in the second year (he), <br />disregarding Satakamini, despatches to the western regions an army <br />strong in cavalry, elephants, infantry (nara) and chariots (ratha) <br />and by that army having reached the Kanha-bemna, he throws the city <br />of the Musikas into consternation. Again in the third year,<br /><br />(L. 5) (he) versed in the science of the Gandharvas (i.e., <br />music), entertains the capital with the exhibition of dapa, dancing, <br />singing and instrumental music and by causing to be held festivities <br />and assemblies (samajas); similarly in the fourth year, 'the Abode of <br />Vidyadharas' built by the former Kalingan king(s), which had not been <br />damaged before Â…Â…Â…..................... with their coronets rendered <br />meaningless, with their helmets (?) (bilma) cut in twain (?), and <br />with their umbrellas and<br /><br />(L. 6) bhingaras cast away, deprived of their jewels (i.e., <br />ratana, Skt. ratna, precious objects) all the Rathikas and Bhojakas <br />(he) causes to bow down at his feet. Now in the fifth year he brings <br />into the capital from the road of Tansauliya the canal excavated in <br />the year one hundred-and-three of King <br />Nanda ................... ......... Having been (re-)anointed (he <br />while) celebrating the Rajasuya, remits all tithes and cesses,<br /><br />(L. 7) bestows many privileges (amounting to) hundreds of <br />thousands or the City-Corporation and the Realm-Corporation. In the <br />seventh year of his reign, his famous wife of Vajiraghara obtained <br />the dignity of auspicious motherhood Â…Â…Â…Â….Then in the eighth year, <br />(he) with a large army having sacked Goradhagiri<br /><br />(L.8) causes pressure on Rajagaha (Rajagriha). On account of <br />the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimi<br />[ta] retreated to Mathura having extricated his demoralized army and <br />transport.Â… Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….(He) givesÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…..with foliage<br /><br />(L. 9) Kalpa (wish-fulfilling) trees, elephants, chariots <br />with their drivers, houses, residences and rest-houses. And to make <br />all these acceptable (he) gives at a fire sacrifice (?) exemption <br />(from taxes) to the caste of Brahmanas. Of <br />Arhat ..................................<br /><br />(L. 10) ..................(He) causes to be built . . . . a <br />royal residence (called) the Palace of Great Victory (Mahavijaya) at <br />the cost of thirty-eight hundred thousands. And in the tenth year <br />(he), following (the three-fold policy) of chastisement, alliance and <br />conciliation sends out an expedition against Bharatavasa (and) brings <br />about the conquest of the land (or, country) ........ and obtains <br />jewels and precious things of the (kings) attacked.<br /><br />(L.11) .................. And the market-town (?) Pithumda <br />founded by the Ava King he ploughs down with a plough of asses; and <br />(he) thoroughly breaks up the confederacy of the Tamil T[r]amira <br />(Dramira) countries of one hundred and thirteen years, which has been <br />a source of danger to (his) Country (Janapada). And in the twelfth <br />year he terrifies the kings of the Utarapatha with .................. <br />thousands of<br /><br />(L.12) .................. And causing panic amongst the <br />people of Magadha (he) drives (his) elephants into the Sugamgiya <br />(Palace), and (he) makes the King of Magadha, Bahasatimita, bow at <br />his feet. And (he) sets up (the image) 'the Jina of Kalinga' which <br />had been taken away by King Nanda .................. and causes to be <br />brought home the riches of Amga and Magadha along with the keepers of <br />the family jewels of ....................<br /><br />(L. 13) .................(He) builds excellent towers with <br />carved interiors and creates a settlement of a hundred masons, giving <br />them exemption from land revenue. And a wonderful and marvellous <br />enclosure of stockade for driving in the elephants (he)...... and <br />horses, elephants, jewels and rubies as well as numerous pearls in <br />hundreds (he) causes to be brought here from the Pandya King.<br /><br />(L. 14) .................(he) subjugates. In the thirteenth <br />year, on the Kumari Hill where the Wheel of Conquest had been well-<br />revolved (i.e., the religion of Jina had been preached), (he) offers <br />respectfully royal maintenances, China clothes (silks) and white <br />clothes to (the monks) who (by their austerities) have extinguished <br />the round of lives, the preachers on the religious life and conduct <br />at the Relic Memorial. By Kharavela, the illustrious, an a layman <br />devoted to worship, is realised (the nature of) jiva and deha<br /><br />(L. 15) ................ bringing about a Council of the wise <br />ascetics and sages, from hundred (i.e., all) quarters, the monks <br />(samanas) of good deeds and who have fully followed (the <br />injunctions) .................. near the Relic Depository of the <br />Arhat, on the top of the hill, ............ with <br />stones .............. brought from many miles (yojanas) quarried from <br />excellent mines (he builds) shelters for the Sinhapatha Queen <br />Sindhula. ................ .........................<br /><br />(L. 16) .................Patalaka(?)Â…Â…Â…(he) sets up four <br />columns inlaid with berylÂ…Â…..at the cost of twenty-five hundred <br />thousands; (he) causes to be compiled expeditiously the (text) of the <br />seven-fold Angas of the sixty-four (letters). He is the King of <br />Peace, the King of Prosperity, the King of Monks (bhikshus), the King <br />of Religion (Dharma), who has been seeing, hearing and realising <br />blessings (kalyanas)-<br /><br />(L. 17) ................ accomplished in extraordinary <br />virtues, respector of every sect, the repairer of all temples, one <br />whose chariot and army are irresistible, one whose empire is <br />protected by the chief of the empire (himself), descended from the <br />family of the Royal Sage Vasu, the Great conqueror, the King, the <br />illustrious Kharavela.</div>
