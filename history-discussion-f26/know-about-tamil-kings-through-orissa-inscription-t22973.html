			<div class="content">1465 to 165 BCE: over one thousand years of sangam period fromHathikumba edicts For over 1,300 years and 49 generations, the three ancient Tamil kingdoms had an agreement of understanding. The basis of this agreement was based upon the literary creation Tolkappiyam?s Purathinai.<br />The ancient Hathikumba inscription, its message on the Tamils the great king of Kalinga Karavela tells in his Hathikumba inscription (Elephant cave): "All the Tamil kings were bound by an united alliance", when he had visited these parts of Tamil country during 165 BCE. and states that this alliance had been in force for 1,300 years, "and these kings acted cohesively". He feels that if this agreement continued to exist, it will be an impending danger even to his empire.<br /><br />It was at this time the Cheraputra Anthuvan defeated the Kongu country king at Karuvur and captures it. As per the existing agreement, the King sows decayed seeds in the fertile paddy fields and ploughs them with asses.<br /><br />However, Karavela induces the Cheraputra King to expand his kingdom by not relieving his captured territory, thereby enticing him to break the treaty which had lived over the ages.<br /><br />The inscription of Hathikumba was fully deciphered by J.P. Jayaswal MA Barister, Patna and Professor R.D. Banerjee, MA Banaras Hindu University. They were of a doubt whether this alliance or agreement of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms could have lasted 1,300 years. Hence, they had interpreted that the total number of years could not be 1300 years and decided it as 113 years.<br /><br />Though there are no inscriptions in Tamil Nadu that such agreements existed, it is true that such an agreement existed throughout the Sangam Period. To carryout such a treaty, it is a necessity to have a sort of control document. Hence, to implement such an agreement, these guidelines and rules were framed in into the famous book of Tolkappiyam which is considered a literary and legal bible of the Tamils. This could be found in Purathinai of Tolkappiyam. Just like a legal document, the Purathinai which comprises of the five divisions (Kurinji, Mullai, Marudham, Neidhal and Paalai), contains all the legal guidelines for this agreement. And this should have been done when Tolkappiam was formulated in its early ages. In a similar manner to Purathinai, Agathinai should also have been scripted together with Purathinai and created during its nascent stage.<br /><br />In the olden age, the rules formed by the Tamil literary books had not been created by any one scholar. Each rule must have been created by one scholar (Pulavar) or by a group of learned men after considerable research. It was then created into an organized structure of rules and regulations. Most of the rules/regulations stated in Tolkappiyam ends with "enba" or "Mozhiba". For example:<br />"Nunnithinayadhor kandavarae", "Yenmanaar Pulamayoerae", "Enba Unarumoerae", "Enba arichandinoerae"<br />are some verses of Tolkappiyam.<br /><br />It can be inferred that these verses have been created and large volumes of regulatory/ legal books of Sangam literature have been created by means of conducting conferences (Tamil Sangam) of Tamil scholars during that age.<br />This legal document of Tamils, named Tolkappiyam, had evolved through the ages after its original creation by groups of Tamil pundits by suitably amending periodically and regulated as per the prevailing times and finally formed into a final shape as being read now. Both Agathinai and Purathinai were added with further information like ?Agreement of Tamil Kingdoms?, and evolved into a biblical book called Tolkaapiyam, which means ?to preserve the olden and enlighten it to the people?. Considering the beginning of the era of ?Agreement of Three Kings? to be 1465 BC this creation of the final issue of Tolkappiyam should be after about 5 years or in 1460 BC. From: this day, the culture of the Tamils had been classified as ?Agam? and ? Puram? and people had lived by it.<br /><br />Cooperative treaty between three kings There was a cooperative treaty which gradually evolved from a single prince into ultimate formation of three kingdoms.<br />1. Rule by Small Grouping: When this was decided, there was only one crown prince of the Pandya King who along with his two brothers divided the country into Chera, Chola and Pandya and ruled the entire kingdom. Later the 12 velirs divided the country into smaller areas and ruled with greater interaction with the common people. Even during ages when good transportation facilities did not exist, there existed such kings who can be called upon any time. This way of rule which existed so long ago in Tamil country has a special reputation on its own.<br /><br />2. Way of working of these Kings: ?Kudi purangathombi kutrangadithal vendhan thozhil? ? this means the kings? duty is to do service to his country men, render justice, carry out punishments for criminals, maintain an army to safeguard the country. He himself undergoes a lot of training regarding warfare.<br />3. Three countries and the Three Kings: The three kings were praised profusely for their rule. The many velirs in each of these kingdoms were a sort of subordinates to these kings. The geographical contours of these kingdoms were used to create the symbols of these kingdoms and these symbols were minted in their coins. The symbols and flags were individualistic for each of these three kings. Velirs did not have such symbols or flags.<br /><br />4. Relationships ? Friendships and enmity: Among the velirs and kings, relationships were maintained through marriages and this was maintained ancestrally like a rule or a regulation . This can be inferred from Kabilar?s visit along with Paari?s daughters for trying to engage these girls with Velir?s sons (Puram: 200, 201, 202). For any grudge/ disagreements, there were conflicts only among these velirs or kings. These conflicts were only among the 3 kings + 12 velirs and their relations and strictly as per the rules and guidelines of the literary legal books.<br /><br />5. Capture of Territories: If war was conducted as per Purathinai, even if a king captures several countries, there will be no change in the state of the kingdoms. Only the bravery of the war was looked upon and praised. The books tell about the direct involvement of the kings in the war and their brave deaths. However, the three kingdoms always existed as separate entities and secured as per the common law. For the bravery of the warriors, symbols of bravery called ?Ninaivu chinnams? (small buildings) were only created. There were no kings who had thought about inscriptions to show his pomp or pride.<br />6. The guidelines of the learned scholars: These pulavars sang in praise of the kings and velirs indicating their important achievements, functions and celebrations. It was a common practice that these kings and velirs listened to the advice of Pulavars regarding warfare and acted accordingly.<br /><br />It was only because of the deceitful king Kalingathu Karavelan that this treaty was broken in 165 BC. In this period, we can find evidences of one ruler capturing another?s territory by Cheraputras and Sathyaputras. Even during this time, the Chola King Killivalavan spared the children of Malayan Kari when he ran away in fear, as advised by the Pulavar ?Kovoor Kilaan?. Also the king abandons the Malayan Kari?s kingdom and does not take over it, but leaves the place.<br />Also, it is evident from the Sangam literature that these kings also participated in creation of Ilakkana Nool or literary books and they themselves were established Pulavars.<br /><br />7. Division of Wealth: While capturing other kingdoms, the victorious always took over a lot of the loser?s wealth and brought them to his kingdom. However, he did not take it away for himself. It was divided to all the people of his country. It is not like usurping the entire wealth and dividing among a few greedy rich men.<br /><br />There is no such evidence in any of these literatures indicating such events. Also, there is no evidence of kings flaunting their wealth by constructing self enjoyment houses such as dancing halls etc., There were a lot of developmental activity in agricultural, handicrafts in this age. Trade flourished by sea and land by improvement of infrastructures.<br /><br />8. The invasion of other nations: It is evident that when a foreign invader threatens any of these Tamil countries, all the 3 kings and 12 velirs joined together to form an alliance. There had been training grounds to fight bravely and effectively in a war. It is clear that even the Maurya king could not invade the Tamil country because of their unity.<br /><br />9. The long existed Treaty: This accord of understanding created in 1465 BC survived this longest period ever for 1300 years among the Tamil kings and velirs by scrupulously following the Rules and Regulations by all the kings and rulers, which finally faltered in 165 BC by the Kalingathu Karavelan.<br /><br />Cheraputhra ? who faltered: Unlike the Pandya and Cholas, the cheras were called as ?Cheraputras? as evident from Ashoka?s inscriptions and Greek Scholar Ptolemy?s ?Periplus? writings.<br />After the invasion of Aryans, they elevated themselves by means of their habits and created good relations with kings and big merchants.<br /><br />They were helpful to the influential class by helping them in creating contacts with foreign nations, language translations, understanding other languages and telling their meanings etc.,<br /><br />Many Aryans also learnt Tamil and became scholars. It is understood that the word ?Cheraputra? must have been introduced by the Aryans during Ashoka?s invasion.<br /><br />A group of descendants of Chera king (Cheraputra) became dominant over a period and captured important positions in trade and governance. It was these people who had crept into the Kongu country and captured the big trade center Karuvoor and its allied Chola country.<br /><br />By the wily advice of the Kalingathu Karavelan, these cheraputras had retained the captured country for themselves. These culprits were in hold of the captive regions for about 2 - Â½ years.<br />Chilapathikaram was written by Chera King. In it are the details of the Kongu Komaan (Zamindaar) and Kongu existing as a separate velir country. When this literary creation was being formulated, these cheraputras might have already started dwindling their evil designs and would have returned back to their country.<br /><br />After the 2 ? Â½ years, even though the original cheras returned back to power, they were like men without strength. As they had already been in a time gap of about 10 generations, they were unable to establish themselves like their earlier counter parts and failed to created history.<br /><br />Karuvoor has been depicted as a Trade center only in Karavela?s inscriptions. It is not the capital of Chera King. As per Sirupaanatrupadai (verses 41?50), the capital of Chera king was Vanchi Nagar, situated in kutta naadu.<br /><br />Cheraputras never followed the "common treaty or accord". Their complete ancestral details are available in the book Pathitrupathu. Lots of treasures were distributed among the Pulavars. As per the accord, since the kingdoms do not belong to them, their coins minted in Kongu desam did not have any sovereign symbols.<br />Slowly the Ways of the Sangam Age degenerated and Sangam Period is believed to have ended in AD 200. The powerful alliances of these Sangam Kings declined and rulers of other nations emerged and new ways of governance began to arise.<br />=======================================================<br /><br /><br /><br />"S.Gokul"  wrote: Thanks venkat.

			<div class="content">"Karuvoor has been depicted as a Trade center only in Karavela's <br />inscriptions. It is not the capital of Chera King. As per <br />Sirupaanatrupadai (verses 41Â–50), the capital of Chera king was <br />Vanchi Nagar, situated in kutta naadu."<br /><br />Karuvoor, though was not depicted as capital of Chera's, it is <br />belived and proved to be none other than Vanji, the capital of <br />imperial Cheras. 'Vanchimaanagaram' of Raghav Aiyangar, is a book on <br />this. Moreover, a visit to Karuvoor, will also prove this. 'Vanji <br />Maariyaman' tample is very famous in Karuvoor. And there are many <br />evidence that can be traced to. <br /><br />Rajendhra Cholan!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, kalinga tamil <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>1465 to 165 BCE: over one thousand years of sangam period <br />fromHathikumba edicts For over 1,300 years and 49 generations, the</div></blockquote>three ancient Tamil kingdoms had an agreement of understanding. The <br />basis of this agreement was based upon the literary creation <br />Tolkappiyam's Purathinai.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The ancient Hathikumba inscription, its message on the Tamils <br />the great king of Kalinga Karavela tells in his Hathikumba</div></blockquote>inscription (Elephant cave): "All the Tamil kings were bound by an <br />united alliance", when he had visited these parts of Tamil country <br />during 165 BCE. and states that this alliance had been in force for <br />1,300 years, "and these kings acted cohesively". He feels that if <br />this agreement continued to exist, it will be an impending danger <br />even to his empire.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>It was at this time the Cheraputra Anthuvan defeated the Kongu <br />country king at Karuvur and captures it. As per the existing</div></blockquote>agreement, the King sows decayed seeds in the fertile paddy fields <br />and ploughs them with asses.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>However, Karavela induces the Cheraputra King to expand his <br />kingdom by not relieving his captured territory, thereby enticing</div></blockquote>him to break the treaty which had lived over the ages.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The inscription of Hathikumba was fully deciphered by J.P. <br />Jayaswal MA Barister, Patna and Professor R.D. Banerjee, MA Banaras</div></blockquote>Hindu University. They were of a doubt whether this alliance or <br />agreement of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms could have lasted <br />1,300 years. Hence, they had interpreted that the total number of <br />years could not be 1300 years and decided it as 113 years.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Though there are no inscriptions in Tamil Nadu that such <br />agreements existed, it is true that such an agreement existed</div></blockquote>throughout the Sangam Period. To carryout such a treaty, it is a <br />necessity to have a sort of control document. Hence, to implement <br />such an agreement, these guidelines and rules were framed in into <br />the famous book of Tolkappiyam which is considered a literary and <br />legal bible of the Tamils. This could be found in Purathinai of <br />Tolkappiyam. Just like a legal document, the Purathinai which <br />comprises of the five divisions (Kurinji, Mullai, Marudham, Neidhal <br />and Paalai), contains all the legal guidelines for this agreement. <br />And this should have been done when Tolkappiam was formulated in its <br />early ages. In a similar manner to Purathinai, Agathinai should also <br />have been scripted together with Purathinai and created during its <br />nascent stage.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In the olden age, the rules formed by the Tamil literary books <br />had not been created by any one scholar. Each rule must have been</div></blockquote>created by one scholar (Pulavar) or by a group of learned men after <br />considerable research. It was then created into an organized <br />structure of rules and regulations. Most of the rules/regulations <br />stated in Tolkappiyam ends with "enba" or "Mozhiba". For example:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>"Nunnithinayadhor kandavarae", "Yenmanaar Pulamayoerae", "Enba <br />Unarumoerae", "Enba arichandinoerae"<br />  are some verses of Tolkappiyam.<br />     <br />  It can be inferred that these verses have been created and large <br />volumes of regulatory/ legal books of Sangam literature have been</div></blockquote>created by means of conducting conferences (Tamil Sangam) of Tamil <br />scholars during that age.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>This legal document of Tamils, named Tolkappiyam, had evolved <br />through the ages after its original creation by groups of Tamil</div></blockquote>pundits by suitably amending periodically and regulated as per the <br />prevailing times and finally formed into a final shape as being read <br />now. Both Agathinai and Purathinai were added with further <br />information like "Agreement of Tamil Kingdoms", and evolved into a <br />biblical book called Tolkaapiyam, which means "to preserve the olden <br />and enlighten it to the people". Considering the beginning of the <br />era of "Agreement of Three Kings" to be 1465 BC this creation of the <br />final issue of Tolkappiyam should be after about 5 years or in 1460 <br />BC. From: this day, the culture of the Tamils had been classified <br />as "Agam" and " Puram" and people had lived by it.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Cooperative treaty between three kings There was a cooperative <br />treaty which gradually evolved from a single prince into ultimate</div></blockquote>formation of three kingdoms.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>1. Rule by Small Grouping: When this was decided, there was only <br />one crown prince of the Pandya King who along with his two brothers</div></blockquote>divided the country into Chera, Chola and Pandya and ruled the <br />entire kingdom. Later the 12 velirs divided the country into smaller <br />areas and ruled with greater interaction with the common people. <br />Even during ages when good transportation facilities did not exist, <br />there existed such kings who can be called upon any time. This way <br />of rule which existed so long ago in Tamil country has a special <br />reputation on its own.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>2. Way of working of these Kings: "Kudi purangathombi <br />kutrangadithal vendhan thozhil" Â– this means the kings&#39; duty is to</div></blockquote>do service to his country men, render justice, carry out punishments <br />for criminals, maintain an army to safeguard the country. He himself <br />undergoes a lot of training regarding warfare.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>3. Three countries and the Three Kings: The three kings were <br />praised profusely for their rule. The many velirs in each of these</div></blockquote>kingdoms were a sort of subordinates to these kings. The <br />geographical contours of these kingdoms were used to create the <br />symbols of these kingdoms and these symbols were minted in their <br />coins. The symbols and flags were individualistic for each of these <br />three kings. Velirs did not have such symbols or flags.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>4. Relationships Â– Friendships and enmity: Among the velirs and <br />kings, relationships were maintained through marriages and this was</div></blockquote>maintained ancestrally like a rule or a regulation . This can be <br />inferred from Kabilar's visit along with Paari's daughters for <br />trying to engage these girls with Velir's sons (Puram: 200, 201, <br />202). For any grudge/ disagreements, there were conflicts only among <br />these velirs or kings. These conflicts were only among the 3 kings + <br />12 velirs and their relations and strictly as per the rules and <br />guidelines of the literary legal books.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>5. Capture of Territories: If war was conducted as per <br />Purathinai, even if a king captures several countries, there will be</div></blockquote>no change in the state of the kingdoms. Only the bravery of the war <br />was looked upon and praised. The books tell about the direct <br />involvement of the kings in the war and their brave deaths. However, <br />the three kingdoms always existed as separate entities and secured <br />as per the common law. For the bravery of the warriors, symbols of <br />bravery called "Ninaivu chinnams" (small buildings) were only <br />created. There were no kings who had thought about inscriptions to <br />show his pomp or pride.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>6. The guidelines of the learned scholars: These pulavars sang <br />in praise of the kings and velirs indicating their important</div></blockquote>achievements, functions and celebrations. It was a common practice <br />that these kings and velirs listened to the advice of Pulavars <br />regarding warfare and acted accordingly.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>It was only because of the deceitful king Kalingathu Karavelan <br />that this treaty was broken in 165 BC. In this period, we can find</div></blockquote>evidences of one ruler capturing another's territory by Cheraputras <br />and Sathyaputras. Even during this time, the Chola King Killivalavan <br />spared the children of Malayan Kari when he ran away in fear, as <br />advised by the Pulavar "Kovoor Kilaan". Also the king abandons the <br />Malayan Kari's kingdom and does not take over it, but leaves the <br />place.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Also, it is evident from the Sangam literature that these kings <br />also participated in creation of Ilakkana Nool or literary books and</div></blockquote>they themselves were established Pulavars.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>7. Division of Wealth: While capturing other kingdoms, the <br />victorious always took over a lot of the loser&#39;s wealth and brought</div></blockquote>them to his kingdom. However, he did not take it away for himself. <br />It was divided to all the people of his country. It is not like <br />usurping the entire wealth and dividing among a few greedy rich men. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>There is no such evidence in any of these literatures indicating <br />such events. Also, there is no evidence of kings flaunting their</div></blockquote>wealth by constructing self enjoyment houses such as dancing halls <br />etc., There were a lot of developmental activity in agricultural, <br />handicrafts in this age. Trade flourished by sea and land by <br />improvement of infrastructures.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>8. The invasion of other nations: It is evident that when a <br />foreign invader threatens any of these Tamil countries, all the 3</div></blockquote>kings and 12 velirs joined together to form an alliance. There had <br />been training grounds to fight bravely and effectively in a war. It <br />is clear that even the Maurya king could not invade the Tamil <br />country because of their unity.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>9. The long existed Treaty: This accord of understanding created <br />in 1465 BC survived this longest period ever for 1300 years among</div></blockquote>the Tamil kings and velirs by scrupulously following the Rules and <br />Regulations by all the kings and rulers, which finally faltered in <br />165 BC by the Kalingathu Karavelan.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Cheraputhra Â– who faltered: Unlike the Pandya and Cholas, the <br />cheras were called as "Cheraputras" as evident from Ashoka&#39;s</div></blockquote>inscriptions and Greek Scholar Ptolemy's "Periplus" writings.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>After the invasion of Aryans, they elevated themselves by means <br />of their habits and created good relations with kings and big</div></blockquote>merchants. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>They were helpful to the influential class by helping them in <br />creating contacts with foreign nations, language translations,</div></blockquote>understanding other languages and telling their meanings etc., <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Many Aryans also learnt Tamil and became scholars. It is <br />understood that the word "Cheraputra" must have been introduced by</div></blockquote>the Aryans during Ashoka's invasion.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A group of descendants of Chera king &#40;Cheraputra&#41; became <br />dominant over a period and captured important positions in trade and</div></blockquote>governance. It was these people who had crept into the Kongu country <br />and captured the big trade center Karuvoor and its allied Chola <br />country. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>By the wily advice of the Kalingathu Karavelan, these <br />cheraputras had retained the captured country for themselves. These</div></blockquote>culprits were in hold of the captive regions for about 2 - Â½ years.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Chilapathikaram was written by Chera King. In it are the details <br />of the Kongu Komaan &#40;Zamindaar&#41; and Kongu existing as a separate</div></blockquote>velir country. When this literary creation was being formulated, <br />these cheraputras might have already started dwindling their evil <br />designs and would have returned back to their country.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>After the 2 Â– Â½ years, even though the original cheras returned <br />back to power, they were like men without strength. As they had</div></blockquote>already been in a time gap of about 10 generations, they were unable <br />to establish themselves like their earlier counter parts and failed <br />to created history.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Karuvoor has been depicted as a Trade center only in Karavela&#39;s <br />inscriptions. It is not the capital of Chera King. As per</div></blockquote>Sirupaanatrupadai (verses 41Â–50), the capital of Chera king was <br />Vanchi Nagar, situated in kutta naadu.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Cheraputras never followed the "common treaty or accord". Their <br />complete ancestral details are available in the book Pathitrupathu.</div></blockquote>Lots of treasures were distributed among the Pulavars. As per the <br />accord, since the kingdoms do not belong to them, their coins minted <br />in Kongu desam did not have any sovereign symbols. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Slowly the Ways of the Sangam Age degenerated and Sangam Period <br />is believed to have ended in AD 200. The powerful alliances of these</div></blockquote>Sangam Kings declined and rulers of other nations emerged and new <br />ways of governance began to arise.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>=======================================================<br />     <br />  <br />  <br />  "S.Gokul"  wrote: Thanks venkat. <br />Certainly an interesting topic.<br />  <br />  I started reading pandiyas but sort of not taken deep interest. <br />  Their history is as fantastic as cholas and unfortunately no due <br />  focus has been given either to their artistic contributions nor <br />the <br />  history as a whole.
