One clue to this is the small <br />number of burials in StonehengeÂ´s earliest phase, a number that <br />grows larger in subsequent centuries, as offspring would have <br />multiplied.<br /><br />Many archaeologists previously believed that people had been buried <br />at Stonehenge only between 2700 and 2600 B.C., before the large <br />stones, known as sarsens, were put in place. The new dates provide <br />strong clues about the original purpose of the monument and show <br />that its use as a cemetery extended for more than 500 years.<br /><br />The earliest cremation burial dated Â— a small pile of burned bones <br />and teeth Â— came from one of the pits around StonehengeÂ´s edge known <br />as the Aubrey Holes and dates to 3030-2880 B.C., roughly the time <br />when StonehengeÂ´s ditch-and-bank monument was cut into Salisbury <br />Plain.<br /><br />The second burial, from the ditch surrounding Stonehenge, is that of <br />an adult and dates to 2930-2870 B.C. The most recent cremation comes <br />from the ditchÂ´s northern side and was of a 25-year-old woman; it <br />dates to 2570-2340 B.C., around the time the first arrangements of <br />sarsen stones appeared at Stonehenge.<br /><br />This is the first time any of the cremation burials from Stonehenge <br />have been radiocarbon dated. The burials dated were excavated in the <br />1950s and have been kept at the nearby Salisbury Museum.<br /><br />Another 49 cremation burials were dug up at Stonehenge during the <br />1920s, but all were put back in the ground because they were thought <br />to be of no scientific value. Archaeologists estimate that up to 240 <br />people were buried within Stonehenge, all as cremation deposits.<br /><br />The latest findings are the result of the Stonehenge Riverside <br />Project, a collaboration between five UK universities, which is <br />funded by the National Geographic Society and the Arts and <br />Humanities Research Council (AHRC), with support from English <br />Heritage. The projectÂ´s last digging season near Stonehenge saw <br />excavation of houses at nearby Durrington Walls, the precise dating <br />of StonehengeÂ´s cursus Â— the ditched enclosure nearly two miles long <br />that has long puzzled archaeologists Â— and new discoveries about <br />the "Cuckoo Stone" and the timber monuments south of Woodhenge.<br /><br />Professor Mike Parker-Pearson, from the Department of Archaeology at <br />the University of Sheffield, who leads the Stonehenge Riverside <br />Archaeological Project, said: "I donÂ´t think it was the common <br />people getting buried at Stonehenge Â— it was clearly a special place <br />at that time. One has to assume anyone buried there had some good <br />credentials.<br /><br />"The people buried here must have been drawn from a very small and <br />select living population. Archaeologists have long speculated about <br />whether Stonehenge was put up by prehistoric chiefs Â— perhaps even <br />ancient royalty Â— and the new results suggest that not only is this <br />likely to have been the case but it also was the resting place of <br />their mortal remains</div>

The projectÂ´s last digging season near Stonehenge saw <br />  excavation of houses at nearby Durrington Walls, the precise dating <br />  of StonehengeÂ´s cursus Â— the ditched enclosure nearly two miles <br />long <br />  that has long puzzled archaeologists Â— and new discoveries about <br />  the "Cuckoo Stone" and the timber monuments south of Woodhenge.<br />  <br />  Professor Mike Parker-Pearson, from the Department of Archaeology <br />at <br />  the University of Sheffield, who leads the Stonehenge Riverside <br />  Archaeological Project, said: "I donÂ´t think it was the common <br />  people getting buried at Stonehenge Â— it was clearly a special <br />place <br />  at that time. One has to assume anyone buried there had some good <br />  credentials.<br />  <br />  "The people buried here must have been drawn from a very small and <br />  select living population. Archaeologists have long speculated about <br />  whether Stonehenge was put up by prehistoric chiefs Â— perhaps even <br />  ancient royalty Â— and the new results suggest that not only is this <br />  likely to have been the case but it also was the resting place of <br />  their mortal remains</div></blockquote></div>

In this<br />article, the <br />details of inscriptions have been gone into.. and<br />finally ending <br />saying nothing in the inscription is related to<br />pallippadai ..<br /> <br />The details are like this: <br /> <br />There was a Sivapathasekara Mangalam.. (now known as Udayalur / Near <br />Pazhayarai @ Patteswaram - which comprises of Ariyapadaiveedu, <br />pambapadaiveedu (Contonments) ..and nandhipuram (vinagaram !). <br /> <br />The Siva temple in udayalur conains inscriptions showing this name.<br /><br />In Udayalur, there are about 3 temples. <br />1. Siva Temple. <br />2. Perumal (Vinnagaram). <br />3. Paalkulathamman koil (on the banks of a village tank. <br /><br />Udayalur Kalyanakrishna B agavathar - propular Harikatha exponent - <br />hails from this Village. This Agraharam figures in lot of Tamil TV <br />serials of -late!<br /><br /><br />In the entrance pillar of Palkulathaman exists the inscription !<br />The pillars are used for installing the temple gate and almost half <br />cemented & painted red - thanks to lack of concern to our History).<br /><br />Kudanthai Sethuraman ( of Raman & Raman bus Service<br />- Industrialist - passed away 20 years back) published a series of <br />articles way back in 70s - which included an article that this was <br />related to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s samadhi / Pulavar Mahadevan ( of Dhinamalar - now <br />too) has helped him in these matters.<br /><br />(Now retired) Principal of Thiruvaiyaru Arts<br />College - Dr. Thangamani has supported this view (as Published in <br />Vikadan Diwali Malar - 2007 - reported in the Gp earlier).<br /><br />Kudavoil Dr. Balasubamanian of Thanjavur claimed that the details <br />are 90% true (as reported in the Junior Vikadan current issue..) but <br />not 100% ..)<br /> <br />What is NOT reported widely is THAT THESE <br />INSCRIPTIONS are FOUND <br />by the British Archeologists as early in 1927-28<br />and Published in <br />the Annual Report of Epigraphy (ARE) under the<br />heading "Samadhi <br />Temples " and " Pallipadais"<br /> <br />Sethuraman quoted apart from this inscription, <br />other inscriptions <br />also : <br /> <br />1. Easana Siva Pandithar (who was the chief Priest<br />of the Big Temple ) was incharge of Sivapathasekaramangalam<br />temple !<br /><br />2. They were practicing Mahavradham and known as<br />Mahavradhis. Which<br />is known as Paasupatha - Laguleesam and this cult<br />normally maintains Pallippadais and they did maintain the Pallippadai<br />of Panchavan Madevi - which is located about 3 KMs West of this<br />temple ! (about 1 KM west of Patteswaram Durgai temple)<br /><br />3. The dilapidated MANDAP (Mundril) was renovated -<br />after the renovator OBSERVED VRADHAMs ! - after about 100<br />years ! in Kulothunga Period !<br />(There is an instance where another Dilapidated Siva temple<br />nearby was renovated, but the renovator DID NOT perform Vradham )<br /><br />4. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> - atleast after making <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> as Heir -<br />apparent in 1012 AD (both co-ruled for 3 years) - appeared to have<br />become Godly person <br /><br />(Pls go through Archives - Godification of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>) -<br />assumed the name<br />Sivapathasekaran and his idols were kept and<br />worshipped in the Big<br />Temple and several other temples including<br />Papanasam !<br /> <br />5. Easana Siva Pandithar - who was maintaing Udayalur / Pateswaram <br />temples - idol is also installed in <br />in the Big temple and several grants were<br />accorded! Means he was kept in very high esteem by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as<br />well as <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>!<br /><br />6. Through the 4th year inscription of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> in the Big Temple. we <br />realise that a VIBOODHI MADAL was also placed in front of PERIYADEVAR <br />IDOL OF <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> ! <br /><br />Summarising ..<br /> <br />The line of thinking that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was Godified and his<br />mortals were accorded Godly status is not out of place ..<br /><br /><br />Whether Udayalur is the Venue is to be decided beyond traces of <br />doubt ..<br /><br />Scholars have taken up this matter to the State Government..<br /><br />A detailed excavation may reveal more details..<br /><br />anbudan / sps<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />****************************************************<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, part I, Asia<br />  Publishing house, 1966 p.18-<br />  "There are also a number of memorial &#40;sepulchral&#41; tomb<br />  temples called paLLippaDai or samAdhi-kOyil. The earliest<br />  epigraphical reference to the building of a pallippadai<br />  is found in an inscription of the 8th year of Vijaya<br />  Kampavarman &#40;886 A.D.&#41; from Cholapuram &#40;429 of 1902 and<br />  EI, vii, p.193&#41;. It mentions that Rajaditya, a member<br />  of the Gangeya vamsa bilingual and a subordinate Chief under<br />  Pallava Vijaya Kampavarman, built a memorial Siva temple and<br />  a tomb in memory of his deceased father Prithvigangaraiyar. The<br />  inscription is bilingual. The sanskrit part gives a<br />  part of the genealogy of the Gangas descended from Kongunivarman,<br />  and the tamil part records that Rajaditya built a palippadai<br />  Siva temple in memory of his father and a tomb where his<br />  mortal remains were interred. Here are the relevant lines: <br />  &#39;Ko visaya kamparkku yaaNDu eTTaavatu pritivigangaraiyar<br />  atitar aayina piRpaaDu tatputra Rajadityan Mahadevan<br />  tam appanaarai *paLLippaDutta iDattu* Isvara aalayamum,<br />  atita graramum &#40;grihamum?&#41; eDuppittuk kaNDu &#40;ndu&#41;<br />  sEvittaan&#39;.<br />  <br />  The use of the expression *paLLippaDutta - iDattu* is<br />  siginficant. It means the place where the dead was laid<br />  to eternal rest - a tomb where the bones of the dead were<br />  buried. It seems to have been the practice to bury the dead<br />  in a tomb and also erect a memorial temple in memory of<br />  the dead. &#40;The Ramayana of Valmiki mentions the<br />  &#39;Smasana Chaitya&#39;&#41;<br />  <br />  Other important examples are the pallippaDai temples built<br />  by Parantaka I in honor of Aditya I/Kodandaraman/Tondaimaan<br />  Arruur Tunjina Devar alias Arinjaya at Melpadi built by Rajaraja I<br />  in his 29th regnal year &#40;1014 AD&#41; in memory of his grandfather<br />  Arinjaya who died at Arruur- which name seems to refer to<br />  Melpadi itself, on the banks of the Niva or Ponni river.<br />  <br />  "AaRRuur tuJcina tEvarkku paLLippaDaiyaaka Sri Rajaraja<br />  Devar eDuppittaruLina tiru-ariJcikai-iicuvaram"<br />  <br />  The devaraja cult in Indo-china and Indonesia: <br />  <br />  In an excellent guidebook, G. Coedes has devoted two chapters<br />  to the institution in Cambodia similar to that of paLLippaDai<br />  prevalent S. India. He holds that the great majaority of<br />  the statues of "siva, Vishnu, Buddha and other deities found in <br />Cambodia<br />  were really representations of kings, princes and other<br />  dignitaries in the form of the gods into whom they expected<br />  to be absorbed at the end of their earthly existence.<br />  The "royal essence" was supposed to reside in a linga, or a statue<br />  of siva, vishnu or buddha. What the body was to a person<br />  while alive, that the temple became after the lifetime, namely,<br />  the architectural abode of the God-King. The communion<br />  between the king and the god tookplace thru&#39; the mediation of<br />  the priest on the sacred mountain in the center of the capital.<br />  The devaraja became the palladium of the kingdom. And this<br />  custom prevailed in Cambodia from about the 9th century AD<br />  &#40;if not earlier&#41; to at least the end of the 12th century AD.<br />  <br />  But on account of the despoliation of the monuments by<br />  treasure-hunters, Coedes was unable to establish beyond<br />  doubt if the corpse was interred, or if, as in modern<br />  Cambodia or Thailand, the ashes or bones were enclosed<br />  in an urn after cremation and the urn deposited in a pagoda.<br />  However, he concludes that the monuments from the time<br />  of Jayavarman VII were temples as well as tombs, and ends by<br />  saying that "Angkor Wat was the final habitation of a<br />  being who enjoyed certain devine prerogatives during<br />  his life, and whom death had transformed into a god.<br />  It was a funerary temple".<br />  <br />  The epigraphical evidence in S. India confirms such a<br />  conclusion. The Cholapuram inscription of the 9th<br />  century mentions clearly both an Isvara-alyam<br />  and an atita griham. Usually such funerary temples<br />  were erected over the places of burial of the mortal<br />  remains of ascetics, saints ans sages. One of the latest and most <br />popular<br />  of such funerary temples in S. India is the that of the<br />  great musician-saint Tyagaraja, on the banks of the river Kaveri.<br />  <br />  We know that the cultural drift was generally from India to SE Asia.<br />  But we do not know whether the personality or devaraja cult had an <br />earlier<br />  common origin or was an outflow from India or had an independent<br />  parallel development in the two regions. We have to<br />  suspend judgement till such time as we get more light on this<br />  question, and meanwhile, rest satisfied with the knowledge that<br />  similar cults were in existence more or less in the same period<br />  in the land bordering Bay of Bengal, tho&#39; the devaraja cult<br />  of SE asia had its own pecuiar development with its own<br />  individualistic features of its own".<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />**********************************************************************<br />  <br />**********************************************************************</div></blockquote>*<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>1&#41; PALLIPPADAI TEMPLE FOR A CHOLA QUEEN<br />  <br />  Panchavan Maadevi Isvaram<br />  <br />  S.

Though there is no <br />foundation<br />  inscription revealing its date or builder, it likely that it was<br />  erected by Rajendra I himself in homage to the saintly character of<br />  his step<br />  mother.<br />  <br />  In any event, this temple is unique as the only pallippaDai known<br />  to be erected in honor of a QUEEN.<br />  <br />  p.272<br />  The above inscription makes mention of a mathadhipati Lakulisvara <br />Pandita<br />  who supervised the affairs of the temple..

The sabha and nagaram of Tondaimaan<br />  PeraaRRuur agreed to maintain this charity in favour of the<br />  Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattarar temple, as requested by<br />  the Mahavratins of Adityesvaram, the ka.nap perumakka.l of<br />  Panriisvarattu Prithivi Vitangar temple and the Panmahesvaras<br />  &#40;SII, v. 7, no. 529&#41;<br />  <br />  Thus we conclude that this is a temple named after Aditya I,<br />  being in fact a pallippadai, built over the mortal remains<br />  of this king who died in this place.

No. 312 of 1913&#41;.<br />  <br />  Chidambaram, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.<br />  <br />  On the north wall of the third prakara in the Nataraja temple.<br />  <br />  This inscription, dated in the 10th year, records an order issued by<br />  Solakon for the welfare of his master. It pertains to an exchange of<br />  140 Â– 7/8 kuli of land in Pallippadai alias Vikramasolanallur in <br />which<br />  was situated the temple of Pidari Tiruchchirrambala-Makali, for an<br />  equal extent of land &#40;i.e., 141 kuli&#41; purchased from the temple of<br />  Varanavasi-Mahadeva, according to the sadhana given by Parasavan<br />  Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan alias Kanakasabhapati-panditan who had the<br />  kani-right of the former temple. This land was made tax-free by <br />order<br />  of the officer Solakon, for the welfare of Kopperunjingadeva. The<br />  inscription reveals the existence of a committee called<br />  `Nilavaravu-kuttap-perumakkal&#39; which was probably in charge of land<br />  income. Some of the temple authorities mentioned here also figure in<br />  the time of Rajraja III and Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya in a few <br />records<br />  of the village[6]. The documents connected with this transaction <br />were<br />  ordered to be preserved in the temple treasury.<br />  <br />  The Pidari temple is stated to have been situated on the southern <br />side<br />  of the `Vikkiramasolan-tengu-tiruvidi&#39;, along which the god &#40;at<br />  Chidambaram&#41; was taken in procession of the sea during festival <br />days.<br />  <br />  Vikkiramasolanallur is here called Pallippadai, but in No. 275 of <br />1913<br />  belonging to Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I dated in the 14th regnal <br />year<br />  it bears the alternative name of Akkan-Pallippadai. From this it may<br />  perhaps be inferred that the remains of the elder sister &#40;akkan&#41; of<br />  Vikrama-Chola were interred here and that the village called after <br />the<br />  king as `Vikkiramasolanallur&#39; was founded at this locality.</div></blockquote></div>
