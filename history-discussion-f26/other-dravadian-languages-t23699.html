			<div class="content">Thanks sps for creating this new thread. But I would rather stay in that thread because I would like to discuss mainly the formation of kerala and malayalam. If we make this thread inclusive, as you have mentioned in the subject 'Other Dravidian Languages', we may not get much information. Also I would like to study the pattern of language formation.<br /><br />So I request you to come to the original thread.<br /><br />Once again thanks for your detailed explanation. I always like the way explain anything. Very good. Keep it up.<br /><br />First question, boundries of tamil nadu. Whatever boundries we see now is the current boundry. 'Then kumari vada vengadam' came from fairly recent literature (I guess!!!). I strongly believe tamil speaking people lived in a separate continent south of present Kanya Kumari. We have references like 'Kadal kol'. Even that is, I feel recent. I said recent because of the long existance of tamil. 'Kadal Kol' may be a well known word when it was written. That means previous occurrance of that may have been there.<br /><br />Second question, I used the word 'abandon' becuase I felt thats the reason why Malayalam were formed (as a result of language revolution). There is not other greater insult than abandoned by their own 'kith and kin'. As you have mentioned, they may be a clan, that doesn't leads to a language revolution unless otherwise triggered. Even in present day tamil nadu, there are many dialects. You can also call them as 'clan'.<br /><br /><br />Like to hear more from you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jagathesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, jagathesh monikandan<br /> wrote:<br /><br />Dear Jagadish Manikandan,<br /><br />Nice to know that you stay and press your views.

			<div class="content">hi jagadish and others,<br /><br />We need to understand a language does not simply happen just overnight, like you say being 8th Century... if there is a literature at that date, then it would certainly be that the language had reached a fairly advanced stage in its development.. and if this language at an advanced stage, it would have taken more than a millenium to reach that status through lots and lots of refinement.. remember the first sangam did not happen overnight..<br /><br />We should also remember just because it was ruled by Tamil speaking kings, it does not mean that the language was never present or was never spoken or was culturally integrated.. Also Cheras ruled from Karur(known as Vanchi) so their dominion existed inside the present day tamilnadu..<br /><br />Kerala culture maybe derived, but its by and large very much unique.. For argument sake lets see if we are finding similar castes for Nair, Menon, etc. in Tamilnadu, if so will they inter-marry.. if the answer is no, then we were not culturally integrated.. Also another point of argument is that Tamil kings ruled over Kerala land, then they would simply enforce tamil as a administrative language and not worry about malayalam..<br /><br />Can you tell me the name of the work which u have mentioned?<br /><br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br />jagathesh monikandan  wrote:<br />Thanks sps for creating this new thread. But I would rather stay in that thread because I would like to discuss mainly the formation of kerala and malayalam. If we make this thread inclusive, as you have mentioned in the subject 'Other Dravidian Languages', we may not get much information. Also I would like to study the pattern of language formation.<br /><br />So I request you to come to the original thread.<br /><br />Once again thanks for your detailed explanation. I always like the way explain anything. Very good. Keep it up.<br /><br />First question, boundries of tamil nadu. Whatever boundries we see now is the current boundry. 'Then kumari vada vengadam' came from fairly recent literature (I guess!!!). I strongly believe tamil speaking people lived in a separate continent south of present Kanya Kumari. We have references like 'Kadal kol'. Even that is, I feel recent. I said recent because of the long existance of tamil. 'Kadal Kol' may be a well known word when it was written. That means previous occurrance of that may have been there.<br /><br />Second question, I used the word 'abandon' becuase I felt thats the reason why Malayalam were formed (as a result of language revolution). There is not other greater insult than abandoned by their own 'kith and kin'. As you have mentioned, they may be a clan, that doesn't leads to a language revolution unless otherwise triggered. Even in present day tamil nadu, there are many dialects. You can also call them as 'clan'.<br /><br /><br />Like to hear more from you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jagathesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, jagathesh monikandan<br /> wrote:<br /><br />Dear Jagadish Manikandan,<br /><br />Nice to know that you stay and press your views.

But finally it boils down there.<br />    <br />    There is one strong reason for this. Look at the &#39;Malayalam&#39;<br />  language. Its a clear mix of both Tamil and Sanskrit. This mix is<br />  evident is all places of the malayalam language. <br />    <br />    These clearly show an external influence over Chera Tamils which<br />  resulted in Malayalam and Kerala.<br />    <br />    Looks like this discussion is going well. Would like everyone to<br />  pour your view.<br />    <br />    Thanks,<br />    Jagathesh<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote: <br />  <br />    HI,<br />    <br />    You cannnot brainwash a society across large area.. Malayalam has<br />  similar words and letters&#40;in scripts&#41;, but geographically also they<br />  are seperated, except for palgat pass and at cape kumari and have<br />  always been identified as a seperate ethnic group for well into<br />  ages.. I would probably disclaim the theory that they were <br />integrated<br />  in tamilnadu, as there was no legitimate or accepted boundary for <br />the<br />  tamilnadu region&#40;till the language based division&#41; and it has always<br />  been fragmented and there has been no integrations, something in the<br />  lines of integration of germany or even integration of India... <br />    <br />    Also going by your theory, we should also claim telugu and<br />  kannada as seperated around the same time.. I guess this kind of<br />  thinking comes from our text book fed knowledge which has been <br />proved<br />  to be faulty at many a times.<br />    <br />    Regards<br />    Nanda<br />    <br />    jagathesh monikandan  wrote:<br />    Please explain.<br />    <br />    Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote: Hi <br />    <br />    I am rejecting this theory... cos of the fault in your point no. 2<br />    <br />    Regards<br />    Nanda<br />    <br />    jagathesh monikandan  wrote:<br />    Formation of kerala:<br />    Shunning its identity as Tamil, Kerala as separate identity came<br />  into existance around 8 AD.
