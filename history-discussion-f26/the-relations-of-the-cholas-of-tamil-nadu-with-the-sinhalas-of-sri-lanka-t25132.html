			<div class="content">A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY <br />ON THE RELATIONS OF THE CHOLAS OF TAMILNADU<br />WITH THE SINHALAS OF SRI LANKA<br />DURING THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD<br />{A.D.849 - A.D 1122}<br /><br /><br />(1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom<br /><br />From: the beginning of the second half of nineth century, the Cholas <br />gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, after <br />a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political obscurity and <br />as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya dynasties of South <br />India.<br /><br />(2) Vijayaalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyaarai in Tamilnadu<br /><br />In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayaalaya Chola (A.D.849-<br />881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu state <br />with his capital at Palaiyaarai, and as a feudatory of the Pallava <br />king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850).<br /><br />(3) Vijayaalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjaavur<br /><br />In the year A.D.852 Vijayaalaya Chola waged war with the Muttaraiyar <br />king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and <br />captured his territory of Thanjaavur.<br /><br />Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjaavur with all <br />facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a temple to <br />the Goddess Kaali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of this <br />period covered the central and the eastern regions of the present <br />Tamilnadu state.<br /><br />(4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his country by <br />Pandiya<br /><br />During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) was <br />awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and disgrace <br />caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the rule of <br />Sena-1(A.D.831-851). <br /><br />(5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka<br /><br />Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his other <br />queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession against <br />Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the chief <br />queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with his <br />father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to himself <br />and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the king Sena-2.<br /><br />(6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country<br /><br />Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of Sri <br />Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named Kutthaka, <br />who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present Mantota and <br />invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed Srimara Sri <br />Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capitol city of the <br />Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya Â– 2 escaped capture and <br />went into hiding. <br /><br />(7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the Pandiya <br />throne<br />   <br />The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the rebellious <br />son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with much of <br />the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country.<br /><br />(8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne<br /><br />Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava king <br />Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava king <br />along with Vijayaalaya Chola and his allies invaded and defeated the <br />rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala forces <br />and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on throne at <br />Madurai in the year A.D.862.<br /><br />(9) Aathiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne<br /><br />Vijayaalaya Chola appointed his son Aathiththa Chola (A.D.871-907) as <br />his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola throne <br />at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayaalaya <br />Chola.  <br /><br />(10) Aathiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola country <br /><br />During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 waged war <br />with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, with <br />whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Aathitha Chola assited <br />the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. The <br />Pallavas won the battle and Aathiththa Chola too was benefitted by <br />being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year A.D. 890 <br />he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the Pallava <br />dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of Nirupathunga. <br /><br />(11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom<br /><br />Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his son king <br />Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the year A.D.910 <br />captured the Pandiya country the southern region of the present Tamil <br />Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 (A.D.905-921) few years <br />after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to Sri Lanka and requested <br />the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-923) to assist him in regaining <br />his kingdom.<br /><br />(12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola<br /><br />In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force under <br />his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture his <br />kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces of his <br />ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined forces of <br />Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at Vellur. <br /><br />(13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia<br /><br />However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by Cholas, and <br />went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal insignia and <br />took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further assistance <br />from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in regaining his <br />kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from Dappula-4 due <br />to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back his crown <br />and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera country the <br />present south Kerala state.<br /><br />(14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka.  <br /><br />Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri Lanka <br />throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown and <br />insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year A.D.944 <br />crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri Lanka <br />with the Pandiyan treasure.<br /><br />(15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission<br /><br />Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana returned to <br />Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but failing <br />in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal insignia from <br />king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the Sinhala king <br />assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan.<br /><br />(16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country <br /><br />Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur by his <br />second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent almost his <br />entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, and <br />finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of TamilNadu.<br /><br />(17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom<br /><br />He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola (A.D956-957) at <br />Thanjavur, who had very short rule.<br /><br />(18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander Sena<br /><br />He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on the throne <br />at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander with much <br />animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to Chola country <br />and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, who sent as much <br />as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola General Paranthahan <br />Siriya Velan in A.D.954.<br /><br />(19) Chola General Meets his death in the battle in Sri Lanka<br /><br />In this battle Sena-5 was defeated and escaped to Rohana, but the <br />Chola commander met his death which made the forces to return to <br />their country.<br /><br />(20) Rule of Utthama Chola <br /><br />After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful successor <br />prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama Chola <br />(A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur to be <br />passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama Chola.<br /><br />(21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne<br /><br />Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja Â– 1 came into power. During <br />this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-1029) ruling from <br />Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by the Kerala <br />mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, and <br />continued to rule the southern half of the island.<br /><br />This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for nearly eleven <br />years with various chieftains yeilding power from time to time over <br />territories in this region and a state of anarchy prevailed. Rajaraja <br />taking advantage of the situation crossed seas and invaded Sri Lanka <br />in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002. His great army known <br />as "muntrukai mahasenai' sacked the seaport city of Mathottam the <br />present Mantota and the interior capital of Anuradhapura, and annexed <br />the northen half of the island to his empire.<br /><br />Rajaraja too on his victory over the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka assumed <br />the a new title as Sinhalanthahan, and a village in Thanjavur in <br />Tamilnadu was named after this title as Singalanthahacchcheri.<br /><br />(22) Polonnaruwa made the Chola capital in Sri Lanka.<br /><br />He named the captured northern half of Sri Lanka as Mummudi-<br />Cholamandalam after another of his titles, and further divided and <br />named them into various provinces. The present Polonnaruwa which <br />formed a part of the province Nigarili Cholavalanadu was made the new <br />capital of his island territorial possessions and was named as <br />Jananathamangalam also known as Jananathapuram.<br /><br />(23) Tamil Trading Settlements established in Sri Lanka  <br /><br />During this period of Chola occupation the Tamil trading guilds <br />Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar also known as Nanadesi Thisaiayirathu <br />Annuruvar and Nanadesis, the Valanjiyar and Nagaratthar who were <br />already trading in Sri Lanka further increased their activities in <br />the Island.<br /><br />At Kataneri the present Vahalkade in the Anuradhapura district the <br />guild of Thisaiayyiratththu Annuruvar established a mercantile town <br />known as Virapattinam.

			<div class="content">Dear SriHari uncle,<br /><br />Your articles are very informative.Thanks a lot & Plz provide these<br />informations in detail.

Epigraphica Indica Vol XXII - Page<br />142 & 144<br /><br />(2) The Thiruvalankaadu Copper Plates of Rajendra Chola - 1 says<br />clearly that "....In the illustrious family of that (king) was born<br />Vijayalaya of praise worthy prowess....He the light of the solar race<br />took possession of Thanjapuri...." South Indian Inscriptions Vol III,<br />Part III No: 205<br /><br />(3) The inscription on a hero stone from Viracholapuram in<br />Thirukkoyilur Taluk says "....Ta(n)chai kotta Koparakesaripa[n]ma[r]<br />kku yandu 3...."<br />In the above undoubtedly "kotta" should read as "konda" possibly a<br />reading error. Annual Report in Epigraphy - Madras 1935-1936, Page 72<br /><br />(4) The Virarajendra Chola's inscription in Bagawathiamman temple in<br />Agatheeswarem in Kayakumasri district states "...Vijayalaya<br />constructed in the Chola country a town named Thanchapuri provided<br />with all the facilities of a new (city)". Travancore Archaeological<br />Series - Vol III, Part 1.<br /><br />(5) From: the inscription of the 7th year of the Pallava king, from a<br />ruined mandapa in front of the rockcut shrine on Melamalai hill at<br />Narthamali region, we note the roch-cut shrine was known as Paliyili<br />Iswarem. The inscription reads as follows: "Hail prosperity! In the<br />seventh year of Kovisaiya Nirupatonga Vikkiramar. Great temple which<br />Sattan Paliyili son of Videlavidugu Muththaraiyan had excavated....I<br />Paliyili Siriyanangai made this (gift).....on behalf of God Rudra of<br />the Paliyili Iswarem...." Inscriptions in the Pudukkottai State by<br />Srinivasan, Part I, No: 19.<br /><br /><br />From: the Reference (1) we note that Muththaraiyars of 8th century are<br />referred to as "Thajaiyarkon" and "Thanjai Natpuhalaalan" which<br />confirms that they were the kings of Thanjavur prior to the emergence<br />of the Cholas.<br /><br />From: the Reference (2) we note that Vijayalaya Chola "took possession<br />of Thanjapuri" form some other - whom we know were the Muththaraiyars<br />from reference (1)<br /><br />From: the Reference (3) we note that Koparakesaripanmar in his 3rd<br />year captured Thanjai.<br /><br />But we also know from the time of Aathiththa Chola, that Thanjavur<br />was the capital of of Chola kings up to the time of Rajaraja Chola -<br />1.<br />Also we note from the time of Rajendra Chola - 1, even though<br />Gangaikonda Cholapuram was the new Chola capital city up to the time<br />the Pandiyan invasion by Sadaiyavarman Sundarapandiyan - the city<br />Thanjavur was still in the Chola fold.<br /><br />We also know that Aathiththa Chola the son of Vijayalaya Chola and<br />was known as Rajakesaripanmar. Hence in the light of all the above<br />the Koparakesaripanmar referred above, and the only Chola king among<br />the medieval Cholas who had the neceesity to capture Thanjavur is<br />without any doubt was the Vijayalaya Chola, who captured Thanjavur in<br />his third year (850 + 3) A.D.853 from the Muththaraiyars and re-built<br />Thanjavur as his new capital [in lieu of Palaiyarai which was his<br />first capital] as seen from the reference (4).<br /><br />From: reference (5) it is clear that Sattan Paliyili was the son of<br />Videlvidugu Muththaraiyan, leaving no doubt to any one that Sattan<br />Paliyili was in fact was a Muththaraiyar king even though the<br />inscription has not specifically mentioned of same. This inscription<br />was issued in the 7th year of he Pallava king Nirupathunga, that is<br />in (862+7)A.D.869.<br /><br />The Thanjavur was captured by Vijayalaya in A.D.853 and the above<br />inscription of A.D.869 refers to the son, daughter, and son-in-law of<br />the Muththaraiyar king Sattan Paliyili making expansions and<br />endowments the Narthamalai rock-cut Siva temple excavated by Sattan<br />Paliyili and named Paliyili Iswarem.<br /><br />Hence from the foregoing as we know the Muththaraiyar king who lived<br />closely to the time of the Vijayalaya's capture of Thanjavur was<br />Sattan Paliyili, undoubtedly he was the Muththaraiyar king defeated<br />by Vijayalaya Chola.<br /><br />Further (Thiru Gokul) as mentioned by you one of the cave temples -<br />that is a rock-cut temple was "Sattan Paliyili Iswarem" excavated by<br />the Muththaraiyar king Sattan Paliyili.<br /><br />But the structural temple built on Narthamalai is quite a different<br />temple from rock-cut (excavated) Paliyili Iswarem, and has nothing to<br />do with Sattan Paliyili or any other Muththaraiyar kings.<br /><br />This granite structural Siva temple was built by a chief working<br />under Vijayalaya Chola after the capture of Thanjavur, and named it<br />after his king as Vijayalaya Choliswarem (Cholichcharem).<br />Inscriptions of Pudukkottai State - No 282.<br /><br />Trust the foregoing informations are of interest to you.<br /><br />Anbudan<br /><br />Sri Hari.</div>

			<div class="content">Anbulla thiru srihari,<br /><br />Excellent and in depth information. Thanks for taking pains to refer<br />all the original references. Yours cliam that it was sattan pazhili<br />who was defeated by vijayalaya seems to be a very logical<br />conclusion. I will discuss this with Dr.Kalaikkovan further.<br /><br />Vijayalaya choleeswaram - I understand - was built by one Ilango<br />aadi araiyan (aka semboodhi) - a muttaraiya chief. The temple<br />suffered some damage due to rains and was later renovated by Mallan<br />Viduman - again a muttaraiya chief. This info is available in the<br />inscription below the dwarapalakas of choleeswaram (Ref Early chola<br />art by SR Balasubramaniyam)<br /><br />Possibly these people were chieftians to sattan pazhiyili or may be<br />even vijayalaya as you have noted. It is possible that the temple<br />was not actually known as vijayalaya choleeswaram as we find no<br />inscriptions of thanjai konda parakesari or any other chola<br />inscriptions.<br /><br />This term choleeswaram comes from a much later inscription - which<br />you have quoted.<br /><br />Mikka anbudan<br />Gokul.S</div>
