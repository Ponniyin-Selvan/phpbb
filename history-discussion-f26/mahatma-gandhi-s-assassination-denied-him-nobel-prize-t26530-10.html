			<div class="content">Sampath, Gandhi was not a good politician, it is a fact admitted to by several people including his grandson. Saints or in other words very principledpeople do not make good politicians. There are many tibetans who feel thatway about the Dalai Lama now.<br />Â <br />He grossly misjudged Jinnah and tried to over compromise. Granted. As far as overshadowing other freedom fighters I think that is silly and happens everywhere.<br />Â <br />Â Public opinion and credit always goes with what is prominent, unless youcan prove someone did something intentionaly to keep others down (like MGRdid in movies). <br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Wed, 7/23/08, S Sampath  wrote: <br /><br />From: S Sampath <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Mahatma Gandhi's assassination denied him Nobel Prize<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, July 23, 2008, 7:49 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yes.

			<div class="content">Good that everyone are in same line of thought. Though some actions of<br />Gandhi backfired, it takes super human effort to make such decisions<br />and gandhi alone could do it. No one can match gandhi...<br /><br />During my college days, when I read 'Freedom at Midnight' and was<br />lamenting about Gandhi and his greatness, people around me started<br />teasing me by name 'pseudo gandhi' for fun. (till date some of my<br />friends call me by that name). I think everyone who even tries to<br />understand gandhi (like me) will be impressed by his character.<br /><br />If someone is saying that gandhi should be awarded a Noble prize, I<br />would say they have not understood his values. As most of the group<br />members say, he deserves more than that. Its something like Indian<br />cinema fighting for Oscar. As Kamal used to say, Oscar is for English<br />movies and Indian movies competing to get one do not make sense.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Hi<br />Gandhiji has deliberately tried to pin down Netaji because he wasÂ becoming Â very popular in the congress. He saw him as potential threat to Nehru,whoÂ would toe the line of Gandhiji, but not Bose. He openly supported Pattabhi Seetharamiya in one of the Congess presidential elections against Bose (he was supposed tobe a neutral player). Inspite of that Netaji won the elections hands down and Gandhiji declared that 'Pattabhi's defeat is my defeat'. Netaji promptly resigned as the congress president which finally ledto his quitting the INC and starting the Forward Bloc. Even Gandhiji was not an exception to favouritism and oppurtunistic politics.<br />Regards<br />Sundar<br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Malathi Mahadevan <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Wednesday, July 23, 2008 4:59:38 AM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Mahatma Gandhi's assassination denied himNobel Prize<br /><br /><br />Sampath, Gandhi was not a good politician, it is a fact admitted to by several people including his grandson.

			<div class="content">Lol Satish, ennappa neenga, ellaam correcta sollittu do you have to end with another kamal blooper? Oscars *do* have a foreign film category and many films do qualify. The indian films nominated were mother india, lagaan and water. Water was made in Canada though, not strictly an indian nomination. <br />Â <br />Â I have seen many *dumb* east european and chinese movies win oscars!! Some are really good too like 'wonderful life' the italian movie a few years ago that was widely televised. In fact there were even reviews in AV and magazines that Kamal would have played the lead better than the italian actor!<br />Â <br />Anyway, completely outside the subject. Right on with Gandhi.<br />Â <br /><br />--- On Wed, 7/23/08, SatishKumar Arunachalam  wrote: <br /><br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Mahatma Gandhi's assassination denied him Nobel Prize<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, July 23, 2008, 10:20 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good that everyone are in same line of thought. Though some actions of<br />Gandhi backfired, it takes super human effort to make such decisions<br />and gandhi alone could do it. No one can match gandhi...<br /><br />During my college days, when I read 'Freedom at Midnight' and was<br />lamenting about Gandhi and his greatness, people around me started<br />teasing me by name 'pseudo gandhi' for fun. (till date some of my<br />friends call me by that name). I think everyone who even tries to<br />understand gandhi (like me) will be impressed by his character.<br /><br />If someone is saying that gandhi should be awarded a Noble prize, I<br />would say they have not understood his values. As most of the group<br />members say, he deserves more than that. Its something like Indian<br />cinema fighting for Oscar. As Kamal used to say, Oscar is for English<br />movies and Indian movies competing to get one do not make sense.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">I am sorry Sampath, that is a very ungrateful thing to say for someone who gave his life towards a bigger cause andÂ perhaps the onlyÂ human being whoÂ never held an office and yet had his funeral attended by dignitaries the world over.Â Gandhi's impact was not just the freedom struggle it is world over, the principle of non violence and passive resistance is too valuable to be throw under the foot as nothing.<br />Â <br />I dont' have any problem discussing Gandhi but we do so with respect - say I don't understand this and that of what he did. Fine. But to say we could have done it without him is downright ungrateful and simplistic. Simply because you cannot rewrite history to see what it would have been without any major figure.We could haveÂ had software without Bill Gates (poor poor Steve Jobs), we could have had someone else inventÂ theory of relativity if Einstein did not (because Einsteins personal life sucked you know so toss him aside asÂ well), we could have had tamil cinema without Sivaji and MGR (oh well you they dominated and suppressed so many others so who cares)..where do we stop with this? <br />Â <br />Also dont know which part of the world you live in but to most people foreigners India is still Gandhi and Gandhi is India.

It <br />would never have been possible to get freedom without Gandhi. To  <br />my knowledge Britishers were very versatile in doing Divide and <br />Rule. The mandatory quality to break it was a disciplined and <br />selfless person to bring mass together with the aligned motto.  <br />Only Gandhi was able to do it. Ofcourse there were extremist <br />factions who tried the best, which everytime backfired as Britishers <br />had more advanced arms than the factions had.<br /><br />Unfortunately Britishers were dumb and helpless in front of Ahimsa <br />were they had no arms up against and had to abide by our rules.  <br />Only because of Gandhi we were able to make it.<br /><br />As malathi rightly said, let us not go into Pros and Cons of Gandhi, <br />but accept the reality.<br /><br />He infact gave a very true definition to what heights a human can go <br />by selfless service and still give the universal meaning to his <br />actions, instead of leaving the meaning to individual's <br />interpretation.<br /><br />P.S: ONE MORE SMALL REQUEST, A FEW DAYS BACK I HAD REQUESTED THE <br />GROUP TO HELP ME WITH THE LINK TO DOWNLOAD KALKI's PARTHIBAN KANAVU, <br />AS BEING A DIE HARD FAN WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT MOVIE.
