			<div class="content">Dear all<br /><br />I found this in a website<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/tamilnadu/tanjore/page17.htm">http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/tamil ... page17.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Its interesting read<br /><br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />Tanjore is the headquarters of the Tanjore District of Madras State It is a big town having a Railway Station of the same name on the Southern Railway. The Tamil name of the place is Thanjavoor. Since the time of the Imperial Cholas, Tanjore has<br />become famous.<br /><br />Vijayalaya Chola conquered Thanjavoor about 850 A.D. from the Mutharayar Chiefs and made it the capital for his newly founded line of Imperial Cholas, who ruled over Tamilnad for more than 400 years (850 to 1279).They have left an imperishable mark on its history. Probably<br />Tanjore was previously called Tanjai. But others give a derivation to the name from<br />Tanjam, a demon who was haunting the locality and was destroyed by God The demon's dying request to Vishnu<br />was to name the place after him. His request was granted. Some others also give a derivation from Tanjam meaning refuge; the city being thus called the city of<br />refuge.<br /><br />Tanjore became famous during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and his grandson. Raja Raja I ruled during the period 985 to 1013 A. D. He built the magnificent temple of Brihadeswara or Raja Rajeswara. It is said that the king was suffering from black leprosy. The remedy to get rid of this was to build a great temple to Lord Siva after bringing the Sivalingam, from the river Narmada. The disease was the result of<br />infliction of injuries to animals during his past birth as hunter, said his spiritual preceptor.<br /><br />The King did not waste time and within six months visited Narmada River with 64 merchants and brought the Sivalingam. It is said that when the Sivalingam was taken out of the water, it went on increasing in size; that is why the Lingam is known as<br />Brihadeswara.It took 12 years to complete the construction-of the emple, which is the tallest in South India.<br /><br />The Great Vimana built over the sanctum sanctorum is 216 feet high with 14 storeys. The style of construction is<br />peculiar to the South and is akin to Orissan art of construction of temples, like Bhuvaneswar. The site on which it was constructed is said to be the place where the great sage Naimisaranya lived in<br />meditation and prayer.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the south, generally, Gopurams or towers at the entrances to the four sides of the outer walls or Prakarams are of great height; the central tower or Vimanam over the sanctum sanctorum is usually over- shadowed by the height of the Gopuram. But at Tanjorethe main temple rises above the Gopuram as is seen in the temples of Orissa. Within twelve years the temple was completed and King Raja Raja 1. Did the Kumbhabhishekam (installation ceremony) on the 20th day of the 26th year (1011 A.D.).<br /><br />The King took his bath in the tank and was cured of his black leprosy and shone in lustre like the moon. He made very liberal<br />grants together with his elder sister and queens and son and others. Raja Raja I and his son Rajendra Chola I was great<br />conquerors and their territory extended from Ganges to Ceylon and parts of Malaya ArchipelagoThe glory of the newly enlarged empire was reflected in the grandeur of the great temple, a master piece of Dravidian architectural glory. Erected out of the spoils of the conquests, the temple is a fitting memorial to martial achievement. It towers as a monument of piety and religious zeal.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that a very large sum was spent to construct scaffolding to carry the central stone of the Vimanam, to the summit, for which an incline four miles long on scaffolding had to be made. The huge expenditure and the labor involved can well be imagined.<br /><br />In the east and south sides of the encircling cloisters are the Yagnasala, the Kitchen, Store Room and Dining Hall and on the west and north sides stand Parivaralayattu Pillaiar, the nine planetary deities in the shape of Lingas, 108 Lingas, and the figures of the guardians of the 8 directions. On the walls are depicted the 64 divine Plays (Lilas) of Siva.<br /><br />In the sanctum sanctorum stands the Mahalinga like a huge hill, all glowing with lustre. The beauty of the tilak and the purity of the white cloth - on the Linga are unparalleled. There is nothing like this anywhere else in this world. It is unequalled and beyond description. The Avadayar (the lower broad stone) is 54 feet in circumference and 6 feet in height and the Banam. (The upper cylindrical stone) is 231/2 feet in circumference and 9 feet high. When the construction of the temple was completed the Adi Saivas<br />installed the Shivalinga in its place.<br /><br />When they applied the sacred adhesive paste generally used for the purpose of cementing Avadayar and the Banam, the paste melted away and did not bind the two firmly together. The King was much grieved at the mishap. Then an oracle from the skies was heard to say: "If Karur Tevar comes here, the intended work will be accomplished<br /><br />The King encouraged by this, enquired how to meet that great man. Saint Bhoganath, who was present there in disguise, promised to bring Karur Tevar down to the place and sent to Tevar an intimation in a letter tied up to a crow's leg. In obedience to the Saint'scommands Karur Tevar arrived at the temple.<br /><br />By the power of his penance he satisfactorily installed the Shivalinga in the Avadayar using his spit Tamboolam as the adhesive paste. This is fully explained in Karur Puranam. The name of Raj Rajeswaramudayar was given to this great Linga. It has also other names such as Adavallan Dakshinameruvitankan and Peruvudayar. Goddess is known by the name Ulagamuzhududayal.<br /><br /><br /><br />The figure, of Sun and the Moon are carved out on either side of the inner side of doorway to the Mahamandapam and those of Lakshmi and Saraswati on the outer side. There are 252 Lingas in this temple. Mount Kailas, the sacred abode of the Great Siva and Parvati on d mighty Himalayas is called Uttara Meru.<br /><br />On the same analogy, by reason of the scene depicted on the eastern face on the great vimana just above the terrace of the mandapa, this vimana has come to be known ', Dakshina Meru. This pyramidal structure of vimana of 14 store] rising to a height of 216 feet is clearly visible from all sides. With small pillars, pretty balcony windows and beautiful images carved thereon, Enchants the minds and eyes of all spectators. The vimana is 96 feet square at the bottom<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />'The stone covering the top of the<br />vimana below the spherical-shaped stone stupa under the Kalasa is a single block of granite weighing 80 tons. This gigantic block of stone is said to have been lifted up to a place of such a high setting by means of an incline scaffolding built from a village, Vayalur, four miles away from Tanjore on the road to Kumbakonam. On this stone there is a beautiful octagon shaped stupa? The height of the Kalasa placed on this stupa is 12 1/2 feet This Kalasa is made of 3088 palams (9249 tolas).<br /><br />Of copper and covered over with gold plates weighing about 250 palams. In the third story there is a figure of a European wearing a bowler?s hat. Some say that a pious architect hailing fromKancheepuram, who was probably an astrologer also, had cut this model of a European there to show his prediction that the Chola Nayak and Maharaja kings and the English would successively rule over the land<br /><br />Others say that it is the figure of Roland<br />Crape of Denmark, a friend of the Nayak king who reigned in the early part of the 17th century. Yet others say that it is the figure of Marco Polo. Though we cannot with any certainty particularize theindividual represented there, it may well be some European merchant, as foreign trade flourished in the land at the time of the Cholas.<br /><br />The Goddess in the temple is known as Brihannayaki. The usual shrines for Ganapati, Nataraja and Chandeswara are there in the court. A great critic of art and sculpture has said that the figure of Nataraja in this temple is the best of its kind in the South.<br /><br />Nandi, the great Bull, is placed in a mandapam in the forepart of the temple and its size is striking. It is 12 feet in height, 19 1/2% feet ill length and 8 1/4 feet in breadth, weighs 25 tons and is made of one stone. This Nandi is considered to be the second biggest in<br />the whole of India. The biggest one is in the Lepakshi temple in the Anantapur District of Andhra State. Tradition says that this Nandi at Tanjore also was imperceptibly growing in size every day. For preventing its further growth a nail was driven on its back.<br /><br />In the circumambulating corridor, which borders the wall separating the sanctum sanctorum, there are Chola fresco paintings, which have been discovered recently. The entire wall is full of paintings of different periods of the Cholas and Pandavas, narrating their mythological and social customs of different periods. The entire corridor is now under the control of the Archaeological Department of the Government of India. They are taking photographs of the paintings for purposes of studying the social customs and dress of the Pandya period as distinct from the Chola period<br /><br />The Archaeological Department is using a particular kind of chemical for obliterating the exterior surface so that the entire paintings below that surface become visible. At the time of my visit the Archaeological Assistant, who is in charge, showed me the different paintings and explained a very interesting thing which<br />may be mentioned here. "The present-day fashion of wearing the Hawaian shirts, with full sleeves and half sleeves, made of<br />pictorial cloth has been nicely painted during the Chola times.<br /><br />The drummers of the Imperial Cholas used to wear half-sleeved Hawaian shirts with open neck when playing, on their drums, and the full-sleeved open neck Hawaian shorts were worn by the pipers and the buglers as they played on their pipes and bugles with their fingers only. It is apparent that the innovation after<br />World War II of this kind of dress in the country is nothing new to India".<br /><br />Probably it was a derogatory dress for upper class people of the 8th century A.D. and forgotten; during the period of transition and foreign and English rule, English dress came to prominence and our local dress was forgotten. Similarly the dress of the ladies was of so fine a texture and transparency, that it revealed the contours of the body, though the cloth skirted it in several folds. On close study it can be seen from the border of the sarees that the figure was not nude, but the finery of the stuff had made it look so. This goes to show that wonderful varieties of<br />-fine hand-woven sarees were in use in Tanjore District during 800 A.D.<br /><br />In this connection, it is worth mentioning that the District of Tanjore is justly famous as the home of Bharata Natyam, Carnatic<br />Music and Drama. These arts received great encouragement from successive rulers of Tanjore. It is recorded that during the time of Raja Raja I the drama called Rajeswara Nataka used to be enacted in the great temple during the Vaikasi festival.<br /><br />Tanjore from the earliest times was also known all over the world for its delicate textiles. Cotton printing was once the biggest industry in Tanjore and the product was much sought after in England and other European countries. A peculiartextile called Taktti cloth is even now the famous produce of Tanjore. On silk or cotton cloth designs are imprinted with gold powder.<br />In the outer corridor of the temple, adjoining the sanctum, there are several shrines dedicated to several Gods and the most interesting one it of Jwarahareswarar, the God controlling fever. The body of the deity is besmeared liberally with sandal paste.<br /><br />It is believed that if a man suffering from chronic fever offers an ablution of sandal paste to this deity the fever subsides. The fact has been experienced by many. The great temple of stone and its massive structure of 216 feet high is decorated with elaborate sculptures, images of the Hindu<br />pantheon and decorative mouldings. On the parapet of the temple there is an image of Buddha depicted on the eastern side. On the northern side there are 4 human figures with bowler hats, which are supposed to be Europeans<br /><br />There is a small tower 55 feet high on a base of 45 square feet, dedicated to Lord Subrahmanya; the great historianFerguson has said it to be "as exquisite a piece of architecture as is to be found in the south of India and almost divides admiration with the temple itself." The workmanship is considered to be a perfect gem of carved stone work the tooling of the stone in the most elaborate patterns remaining as dear and sharp as on the day it left the sculptor's hands. Ferguson says: "Chola artists conceived like giants and finished like jewelers".<br /><br />The outer structures are decorated with fine and minute sculptures, which proclaim the immense labor and precision that have<br />gone into their production. Even a ring worn on the tiny figures can be moved even now after 1000 years, in spite of complete exposure to sun and rain and weather conditions; the figures are vivid and life-like.<br /><br />A Tanjore Art Gallery has beenestablished in 1951, where fine specimens of Gods and Goddesses of different places have been kept to be shown to the public. Figures made out of pith, placed in the Art Gallery, both coloured and natural, are of exquisite beauty, exhibiting the finest skill of workmanship and art.<br /><br />The Saraswati Mahal, which contains a big library, is considered to possess the largest number of Sanskrit and vernacular palm leaf manuscripts, to the tune of 33,433, beginning as early as the middle of the 16th century. Maharajah Sarabhoji (19th century)established it. The manuscripts number 24,627 in Sanskrit, 1,953 in Marathi, 1,206 in Tamil and 816 in Telugu, on a variety of subjects such as Vedas, Vedanta, Grammar, Music, Dancing, Architecture, Astronomy, etc. Dr. Fernall, who compiled the first<br />catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts, said in 1855 that it was perhaps the largest and the most important. in the world and that it contained a great many useful and very rare or nearly unique books many of which were quite unknown or procurable only with great trouble and expenseTanjore workmen are specially reputed for their skill in making silver articles. Jewels made here draw great appreciation. Gold inlay on silver, called Gangajemin, was once specialized in Tanjore. Enameling of jewels by a peculiar method was another craft of Tanjore. The work was called Munnkkachi. Now this art has disappeared. Calligraphy or the art of beautiful and elegant writing was at the peak during the period of the Maratha rulers of Tanjore.<br /><br />Festival days: Every month, the day on which the ruling star is Satabhishag is treated as a festival as that was the ruling star at the time of Raja Raja's birth. The other festival is Krittika day in the month of Kartika. The annual festival for 9 days is celebrated in the month of Visakha, during which the drama of Raja Rajeswara is also enacted. The deity is daily bathed with fragrant water in which the buds of big Champaka flowers have been soaked. For burning the lamps, only ghee (clarified butter) has to be used at the rate of one ollock per lamp per day. The shepherds would get 90 goats, 48 cows or 16 buffaloes free for supplying the above quantity of ghee.<br /><br />The daily offering to the deity consists of cooked rice (rice hulled from paddy stocked for not less than four months should be used for cooking purposes), vegetable dishes, ghee, dhall, rice boiled in milk, and pansupari. On festival days, the offering consists of eight varieties of cooked rice (mixed with tamarind, coconut, limejuice, jaggery, gingelly, curd, etc.). Other items include cake made with dhall, rice, pepper and mustard; vegetable dishes, fried vegetables, sugar, plantain<br />fruits, tamarind, curd and ghee, and other items.<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Sridhar<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Want to chat instantly with your online friends?

			<div class="content">Dear all<br /><br />Just another anectode on Thanjavur<br />This is from saraswathi mahal website<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sarasvatimahallibrary.com/Thanjavur/thanjavur.html">http://www.sarasvatimahallibrary.com/Th ... javur.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />it also traces the history of cholas<br /><br />It also mentions Vijayalaya as Parakesari....<br /><br /><br />Cheers Sri<br /><br />Thanjavur was the capital of Imperial Cholas. Historical references on Thanjavur are available only after the 7th Century A.D. The epigraphically references on Thanjavur are available at Rock fort edicts of Trichirapalli. The first literary reference about Thanjavur is available in the hymns of Saint Appar of the 7th Century. Hence forward literary and epigraphically references are available on Thanjavur.<br /><br />In 846 A.D the first imperial chola king Vijayalaya Chola captured Thanjavur territory from a Muttarayar King and established his capital at Thanjavur and built a palace. From: the reign of Vijayalaya Chola, Thanjavur continues to be the capital of the subsequent Chola rulers also:<br />ADIDYA. I (871-907 A.D)<br />PARANTAKA I (907-950 A.D)<br />GANDARADITYA (950-956 A.D)<br />ARUNJAYA (956-957 A.D)<br />SUNDARACHOLA (957-970 A.D)<br />MADHURANTAKA UTTAMA CHOLA (970-985 A.D)<br />RAJARAJA I (985-1014 A.D)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Starting from Parakesari Vijayalaya, the successive rulers of Chola dynasty led invasions to Ceylon and during the days of Raja Raja Chola far-off territories such as Kerala, Coorg, Parts of Mysore and Kalinga (Orissa) were subjugated and his successor Rajendra organised a North Indian campaign which led him up to the Ganges.<br />Most of these conquests were lost to the Cholas in the subsequent reigns but it is noticeable that these campaigns and conquests were responsible for the long and continued stability and prosperity of the kingdom and for the resultant encouragement and development of cultural pursuits. After the demise of Rajaraja I, Rajendra I held Thanjavur as his capital for 10 years from his accession (1014 A.D) and later (1025 A.D) shifted his capital to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. After the shifting of the capital, Thanjavur lost its prestige and glory as the capital of Cholas and relegated to the secondary position in the galaxy of capital cities of that time. At the close of reign of Rajendra III, the pandian empire at Madurai was at the height of its prosperity and has subdued the glory of the Chola Empire. In the battle between Maravarman Sundara Pandian and Rajaraja III the Thanjavur city was subjected to heavy damage and ruin by the Pandiya Army.<br />After the Pandiyas, Hoysala rulers ruled the Chola Mandalam for few years and in the 14th century, the Vijaya Nagar Empire brought Thanjavur under its control. During their reign, Thanjavur regained its lost glory. In 1535 A.D, Vijayanagara emperor Achutha Devaraya established the Thanjavur Nayak's rule. He appointed Sevappa Nayak as the first ruler of Thanjavur kingdom. The Nayak rule continued up to 1675 A.D. During the Nayak period also Thanjavur witnessed the flourishing of art, architecture, literature and other allied activities. The Nayakas established the Palace, Moats and fortifications in city of Thanjavur.<br />After the Nayaks, the Marathas captured and ruled Thanjavur till 1855 A.D. Thanjavur was nourished and enriched with arts, literature, buildings, temples etc from the starting of 850 A.D till the end of the rule of the Maratha Kings in 1855 by different dynasties of Thanjavur Kingdom.<br />Albeit all political up heaves, Thanjavur is rightly acclaimed as the cultural citadel of Tamilnadu. Time was when it coruscated like a mammoth diamond and dazed all its beholders with its wondrous brilliance. It is situated amidst the vast deltaic tract of River Cauvery known as the "Granary of South India". Just as Egypt is called "The Gift of the Nile" so as also the Chola culture and Art may be called the gift of the Cauvery River.<br />It is said that the first Chola king, Karikal Cholan, who ruled over the Chola country in the later half of the first century A.D had built the Grant Anicut across the river Cauvery, which remains an engineering marvel even today and which is known as "Kallanai". The Great Rajarajan, the latter Chola King (985-1014 A.D.) built Rajareswaram, the Big temple at Thanjavur, which according to experts, is a standing classical monument of the Chola style of art and architecture.<br />Great poets, skilled builders and master craftsmen, savants and scholars and enlightened Kings combined to create a very sophisticated and advanced civilisation whose influence was felt not only in the Indian peninsula but also in the adjoining archipelago and as far as Orissa. Temples of grand designs and majestic proportions, embellished with the works of skilled sculptors, are the visible manifestations of the spirit and culture, priorities and principles, cherished values and beliefs of the people who lived in those days.<br />Today Thanjavur is well known throughout the world for its Big Temple or the Brihasdisvara temple, magnificent Palace, the famous Raja Serfoji' Sarasvati Mahal Library, Art Gallery and also known for its exquisite handicrafts, like Art plate, Pith work, bronze icons, Thanjavur paintings and classical south Indian musical instruments. If the Big Temple is an ancient landmark of Thanjavur, the Tamil University a Temple of learning could be spoken of, as its modern counterpart with its impressive temple-like facade along with its library housed in a circular building resembling the architectural style of India's parliament.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Want to chat instantly with your online friends?

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by rrchola  using id rrchola</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />-Dear Mr. Sridhar,<br /><br />The articles you mailed are definitely informative - looking at<br />things from a different plane. For some reasons, when we were<br />students, we did not have good opportunities to read more about<br />Cheras, in comparison with Cholas or Pandyas. The ratio was<br />something close to Chl <img src="../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />nd:Chr :: 6:3:1 or so.<br /><br />The article mailed by you gave us more information on Cheras.<br /><br />I was not aware that the famous " Icchuvai thavira yaamboi indira<br />logum aalum acchuvai perinum venden Arnagamaa Nagullane " Kulasekara<br />Alwar was father of Cheraman Perumal.<br /><br />Those, who had the opportunity to see the Chola Paintings in the<br />first floor of the Vimanam are definitely aware of three things:<br /><br />1. Rajaraja's worshipping at Chidambaram with his Maha-Devis;<br />2. Sundara's marriage and reaching Kailasam in Airawatham with<br />Cheraman Perumal in a horse leading him, with a Vaanan on the tail of<br />Airawatham;<br />3. Dakshinamurthy (Sanakati munivars - in that were there Rararaja<br />and Karuvurar or not - another stuff we will discuss latter)<br /><br />These influence of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> are repeatedly depicted in some form or other -<br />even though Gnanasambandar & Appar evidently kept the Saivam lamp<br />burning in the dark days of Samanam - like Pazhayarai Vadathali<br />covered and closed for woship in Appar's days!<br /><br />Why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> was attracted to Sundarar? Why he is repeatedly impressed<br />with Cheraman?<br /><br />I personally speculate: Sundarar is a Siva worshipper like a common<br />man - suspecting the quality of Gold given by Siva, fought with the<br />Sabah.. marrying more than one woman and consequent lies etc..<br />Inspite of being so, he was considered to be a FRIEND of Siva, when<br />others preferred to remain as desciples.<br />Cheraman reported to have reached Kailasam - with the same human body<br />as per the painting - but after shedding the human body - as per<br />Sundarar's last Padhigam - reportedly sent through Varunan! It is<br />also evident that Raraja was very much inspired by Kailasam - Meru!<br />So there is strong reason for his attraction towards Sundarar -<br />Cheraman combine - adds., Kudavoil - the History was also of recent<br />past - about 150 yr old only (in 1000 AD).<br /><br />Chidambaram - even today is dominated by Munkudimi Deekshathars -<br />hailing from Cheranadu - following Chera tradition - in the heart<br />land of Chola Empire. Vaidhumbai Kalyani's men were deputed there<br />in a big way, says Sastri.<br /><br />However, we experience a nice blend of Chera - Chola combine in the<br />two paitings of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>.<br /><br />Moreover, Kalki says, it was "Pandiyna Abathudavigal" who were behing<br />Aditha Karikala - but Ravidasan & Co., hail from Cheranadu! That is a<br />real twist in History and someone should find an answer. The answer<br />shall definitely lie in chera History and not in Chola or Pandiya<br />Histories.<br /><br />Thus it becomes all the more important to read about Cheras.<br /><br />I am sure, if not in a haste, we should have a serial of discussions<br />on this subject when time permits.<br /><br />Regards.

The Tamil name of the place is Thanjavoor. Since<br />the time of the Imperial Cholas, Tanjore has<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>become famous.<br /> <br />  Vijayalaya Chola conquered Thanjavoor about 850 A.D. from the<br />Mutharayar Chiefs and made it the capital for his newly founded line</div></blockquote>of Imperial Cholas, who ruled over Tamilnad for more than 400 years<br />(850 to 1279).They have left an imperishable mark on its history.<br />Probably<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Tanjore was previously called Tanjai. But others give a derivation<br />to the name from<br />  Tanjam, a demon who was haunting the locality and was destroyed by<br />God The demon&#39;s dying request to Vishnu<br />  was to name the place after him. His request was granted. Some<br />others also give a derivation from Tanjam meaning refuge; the city</div></blockquote>being thus called the city of<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>refuge.<br /> <br />  Tanjore became famous during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and his<br />grandson. Raja Raja I ruled during the period 985 to 1013 A. D. He</div></blockquote>built the magnificent temple of Brihadeswara or Raja Rajeswara. It is<br />said that the king was suffering from black leprosy. The remedy to<br />get rid of this was to build a great temple to Lord Siva after<br />bringing the Sivalingam, from the river Narmada. The disease was the<br />result of<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>infliction of injuries to animals during his past birth as hunter,<br />said his spiritual preceptor.<br /> <br />  The King did not waste time and within six months visited Narmada<br />River with 64 merchants and brought the Sivalingam. It is said that</div></blockquote>when the Sivalingam was taken out of the water, it went on increasing<br />in size; that is why the Lingam is known as<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Brihadeswara.It took 12 years to complete the construction-of the<br />emple, which is the tallest in South India.<br /> <br />  The Great Vimana built over the sanctum sanctorum is 216 feet high<br />with 14 storeys. The style of construction is<br />  peculiar to the South and is akin to Orissan art of construction of<br />temples, like Bhuvaneswar. The site on which it was constructed is</div></blockquote>said to be the place where the great sage Naimisaranya lived in<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>meditation and prayer.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  In the south, generally, Gopurams or towers at the entrances to the<br />four sides of the outer walls or Prakarams are of great height; the</div></blockquote>central tower or Vimanam over the sanctum sanctorum is usually over-<br />shadowed by the height of the Gopuram. But at Tanjorethe main temple<br />rises above the Gopuram as is seen in the temples of Orissa. Within<br />twelve years the temple was completed and King Raja Raja 1. Did the<br />Kumbhabhishekam (installation ceremony) on the 20th day of the 26th<br />year (1011 A.D.).<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The King took his bath in the tank and was cured of his black<br />leprosy and shone in lustre like the moon. He made very liberal<br />  grants together with his elder sister and queens and son and<br />others. Raja Raja I and his son Rajendra Chola I was great<br />  conquerors and their territory extended from Ganges to Ceylon and<br />parts of Malaya ArchipelagoThe glory of the newly enlarged empire was</div></blockquote>reflected in the grandeur of the great temple, a master piece of<br />Dravidian architectural glory. Erected out of the spoils of the<br />conquests, the temple is a fitting memorial to martial achievement.<br />It towers as a monument of piety and religious zeal.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>It is interesting to note that a very large sum was spent to<br />construct scaffolding to carry the central stone of the Vimanam, to</div></blockquote>the summit, for which an incline four miles long on scaffolding had<br />to be made. The huge expenditure and the labor involved can well be<br />imagined.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In the east and south sides of the encircling cloisters are the<br />Yagnasala, the Kitchen, Store Room and Dining Hall and on the west</div></blockquote>and north sides stand Parivaralayattu Pillaiar, the nine planetary<br />deities in the shape of Lingas, 108 Lingas, and the figures of the<br />guardians of the 8 directions. On the walls are depicted the 64<br />divine Plays (Lilas) of Siva.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In the sanctum sanctorum stands the Mahalinga like a huge hill, all<br />glowing with lustre. The beauty of the tilak and the purity of the</div></blockquote>white cloth - on the Linga are unparalleled. There is nothing like<br />this anywhere else in this world. It is unequalled and beyond<br />description. The Avadayar (the lower broad stone) is 54 feet in<br />circumference and 6 feet in height and the Banam. (The upper<br />cylindrical stone) is 231/2 feet in circumference and 9 feet high.<br />When the construction of the temple was completed the Adi Saivas<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>installed the Shivalinga in its place.<br /> <br />  When they applied the sacred adhesive paste generally used for the<br />purpose of cementing Avadayar and the Banam, the paste melted away</div></blockquote>and did not bind the two firmly together. The King was much grieved<br />at the mishap. Then an oracle from the skies was heard to say: "If<br />Karur Tevar comes here, the intended work will be accomplished<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The King encouraged by this, enquired how to meet that great man.<br />Saint Bhoganath, who was present there in disguise, promised to bring</div></blockquote>Karur Tevar down to the place and sent to Tevar an intimation in a<br />letter tied up to a crow's leg. In obedience to the Saint'scommands<br />Karur Tevar arrived at the temple.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>By the power of his penance he satisfactorily installed the<br />Shivalinga in the Avadayar using his spit Tamboolam as the adhesive</div></blockquote>paste. This is fully explained in Karur Puranam. The name of Raj<br />Rajeswaramudayar was given to this great Linga. It has also other<br />names such as Adavallan Dakshinameruvitankan and Peruvudayar. Goddess<br />is known by the name Ulagamuzhududayal.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The figure, of Sun and the Moon are carved out on either side of<br />the inner side of doorway to the Mahamandapam and those of Lakshmi</div></blockquote>and Saraswati on the outer side. There are 252 Lingas in this temple.<br />Mount Kailas, the sacred abode of the Great Siva and Parvati on d<br />mighty Himalayas is called Uttara Meru.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>On the same analogy, by reason of the scene depicted on the eastern<br />face on the great vimana just above the terrace of the mandapa, this</div></blockquote>vimana has come to be known ', Dakshina Meru. This pyramidal<br />structure of vimana of 14 store] rising to a height of 216 feet is<br />clearly visible from all sides. With small pillars, pretty balcony<br />windows and beautiful images carved thereon, Enchants the minds and<br />eyes of all spectators. The vimana is 96 feet square at the bottom<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>&#39;The stone covering the top of the<br />  vimana below the spherical-shaped stone stupa under the Kalasa is a<br />single block of granite weighing 80 tons. This gigantic block of</div></blockquote>stone is said to have been lifted up to a place of such a high<br />setting by means of an incline scaffolding built from a village,<br />Vayalur, four miles away from Tanjore on the road to Kumbakonam. On<br />this stone there is a beautiful octagon shaped stupa? The height of<br />the Kalasa placed on this stupa is 12 1/2 feet This Kalasa is made of<br />3088 palams (9249 tolas).<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Of copper and covered over with gold plates weighing about 250<br />palams. In the third story there is a figure of a European wearing a</div></blockquote>bowler's hat. Some say that a pious architect hailing<br />fromKancheepuram, who was probably an astrologer also, had cut this<br />model of a European there to show his prediction that the Chola Nayak<br />and Maharaja kings and the English would successively rule over the<br />land<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Others say that it is the figure of Roland<br />  Crape of Denmark, a friend of the Nayak king who reigned in the<br />early part of the 17th century. Yet others say that it is the figure</div></blockquote>of Marco Polo. Though we cannot with any certainty particularize<br />theindividual represented there, it may well be some European<br />merchant, as foreign trade flourished in the land at the time of the<br />Cholas.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Goddess in the temple is known as Brihannayaki. The usual<br />shrines for Ganapati, Nataraja and Chandeswara are there in the</div></blockquote>court. A great critic of art and sculpture has said that the figure<br />of Nataraja in this temple is the best of its kind in the South.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Nandi, the great Bull, is placed in a mandapam in the forepart of<br />the temple and its size is striking. It is 12 feet in height, 19 1/2%</div></blockquote>feet ill length and 8 1/4 feet in breadth, weighs 25 tons and is made<br />of one stone. This Nandi is considered to be the second biggest in<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>the whole of India. The biggest one is in the Lepakshi temple in<br />the Anantapur District of Andhra State. Tradition says that this</div></blockquote>Nandi at Tanjore also was imperceptibly growing in size every day.<br />For preventing its further growth a nail was driven on its back.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In the circumambulating corridor, which borders the wall separating<br />the sanctum sanctorum, there are Chola fresco paintings, which have</div></blockquote>been discovered recently. The entire wall is full of paintings of<br />different periods of the Cholas and Pandavas, narrating their<br />mythological and social customs of different periods. The entire<br />corridor is now under the control of the Archaeological Department of<br />the Government of India. They are taking photographs of the paintings<br />for purposes of studying the social customs and dress of the Pandya<br />period as distinct from the Chola period<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Archaeological Department is using a particular kind of<br />chemical for obliterating the exterior surface so that the entire</div></blockquote>paintings below that surface become visible. At the time of my visit<br />the Archaeological Assistant, who is in charge, showed me the<br />different paintings and explained a very interesting thing which<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>may be mentioned here. "The present-day fashion of wearing the<br />Hawaian shirts, with full sleeves and half sleeves, made of<br />  pictorial cloth has been nicely painted during the Chola times.<br /> <br />  The drummers of the Imperial Cholas used to wear half-sleeved<br />Hawaian shirts with open neck when playing, on their drums, and the</div></blockquote>full-sleeved open neck Hawaian shorts were worn by the pipers and the<br />buglers as they played on their pipes and bugles with their fingers<br />only. It is apparent that the innovation after<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>World War II of this kind of dress in the country is nothing new to<br />India".<br /> <br />  Probably it was a derogatory dress for upper class people of the<br />8th century A.D. and forgotten; during the period of transition and</div></blockquote>foreign and English rule, English dress came to prominence and our<br />local dress was forgotten. Similarly the dress of the ladies was of<br />so fine a texture and transparency, that it revealed the contours of<br />the body, though the cloth skirted it in several folds. On close<br />study it can be seen from the border of the sarees that the figure<br />was not nude, but the finery of the stuff had made it look so. This<br />goes to show that wonderful varieties of<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-fine hand-woven sarees were in use in Tanjore District during 800<br />A.D.<br /> <br />  In this connection, it is worth mentioning that the District of<br />Tanjore is justly famous as the home of Bharata Natyam, Carnatic<br />  Music and Drama. These arts received great encouragement from<br />successive rulers of Tanjore. It is recorded that during the time of</div></blockquote>Raja Raja I the drama called Rajeswara Nataka used to be enacted in<br />the great temple during the Vaikasi festival.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Tanjore from the earliest times was also known all over the world<br />for its delicate textiles. Cotton printing was once the biggest</div></blockquote>industry in Tanjore and the product was much sought after in England<br />and other European countries. A peculiartextile called Taktti cloth<br />is even now the famous produce of Tanjore. On silk or cotton cloth<br />designs are imprinted with gold powder.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In the outer corridor of the temple, adjoining the sanctum, there<br />are several shrines dedicated to several Gods and the most</div></blockquote>interesting one it of Jwarahareswarar, the God controlling fever. The<br />body of the deity is besmeared liberally with sandal paste.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>It is believed that if a man suffering from chronic fever offers an<br />ablution of sandal paste to this deity the fever subsides. The fact</div></blockquote>has been experienced by many. The great temple of stone and its<br />massive structure of 216 feet high is decorated with elaborate<br />sculptures, images of the Hindu<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>pantheon and decorative mouldings. On the parapet of the temple<br />there is an image of Buddha depicted on the eastern side. On the</div></blockquote>northern side there are 4 human figures with bowler hats, which are<br />supposed to be Europeans<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>There is a small tower 55 feet high on a base of 45 square feet,<br />dedicated to Lord Subrahmanya; the great historianFerguson has said</div></blockquote>it to be "as exquisite a piece of architecture as is to be found in<br />the south of India and almost divides admiration with the temple<br />itself." The workmanship is considered to be a perfect gem of carved<br />stone work the tooling of the stone in the most elaborate patterns<br />remaining as dear and sharp as on the day it left the sculptor's<br />hands. Ferguson says: "Chola artists conceived like giants and<br />finished like jewelers".<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The outer structures are decorated with fine and minute sculptures,<br />which proclaim the immense labor and precision that have<br />  gone into their production. Even a ring worn on the tiny figures<br />can be moved even now after 1000 years, in spite of complete exposure</div></blockquote>to sun and rain and weather conditions; the figures are vivid and<br />life-like.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A Tanjore Art Gallery has beenestablished in 1951, where fine<br />specimens of Gods and Goddesses of different places have been kept to</div></blockquote>be shown to the public. Figures made out of pith, placed in the Art<br />Gallery, both coloured and natural, are of exquisite beauty,<br />exhibiting the finest skill of workmanship and art.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The Saraswati Mahal, which contains a big library, is considered to<br />possess the largest number of Sanskrit and vernacular palm leaf</div></blockquote>manuscripts, to the tune of 33,433, beginning as early as the middle<br />of the 16th century. Maharajah Sarabhoji (19th century)established<br />it. The manuscripts number 24,627 in Sanskrit, 1,953 in Marathi,<br />1,206 in Tamil and 816 in Telugu, on a variety of subjects such as<br />Vedas, Vedanta, Grammar, Music, Dancing, Architecture, Astronomy,<br />etc. Dr. Fernall, who compiled the first<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts, said in 1855 that it was<br />perhaps the largest and the most important. in the world and that it</div></blockquote>contained a great many useful and very rare or nearly unique books<br />many of which were quite unknown or procurable only with great<br />trouble and expenseTanjore workmen are specially reputed for their<br />skill in making silver articles. Jewels made here draw great<br />appreciation. Gold inlay on silver, called Gangajemin, was once<br />specialized in Tanjore. Enameling of jewels by a peculiar method was<br />another craft of Tanjore. The work was called Munnkkachi. Now this<br />art has disappeared. Calligraphy or the art of beautiful and elegant<br />writing was at the peak during the period of the Maratha rulers of<br />Tanjore.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Festival days: Every month, the day on which the ruling star is<br />Satabhishag is treated as a festival as that was the ruling star at</div></blockquote>the time of Raja Raja's birth. The other festival is Krittika day in<br />the month of Kartika. The annual festival for 9 days is celebrated in<br />the month of Visakha, during which the drama of Raja Rajeswara is<br />also enacted. The deity is daily bathed with fragrant water in which<br />the buds of big Champaka flowers have been soaked. For burning the<br />lamps, only ghee (clarified butter) has to be used at the rate of one<br />ollock per lamp per day. The shepherds would get 90 goats, 48 cows or<br />16 buffaloes free for supplying the above quantity of ghee.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The daily offering to the deity consists of cooked rice &#40;rice<br />hulled from paddy stocked for not less than four months should be</div></blockquote>used for cooking purposes), vegetable dishes, ghee, dhall, rice<br />boiled in milk, and pansupari. On festival days, the offering<br />consists of eight varieties of cooked rice (mixed with tamarind,<br />coconut, limejuice, jaggery, gingelly, curd, etc.). Other items<br />include cake made with dhall, rice, pepper and mustard; vegetable<br />dishes, fried vegetables, sugar, plantain<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>fruits, tamarind, curd and ghee, and other items.<br />   <br />  Cheers<br />    Sridhar<br />  FOR MORE DETAILS PLEASE SEARCH FOR RAJRAJAN, PERIYAKOIL,<br />RAJARAJESWARAM ETC., Fondly, SB</div></blockquote></div>
