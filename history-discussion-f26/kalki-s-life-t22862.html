The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period and the <br />  incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did interfere in <br />  the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations with <br />the <br />  pandya crown.<br />  <br />  2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya diadems - <br />  which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his state. <br />so <br />  the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by <br />  closing out the pandya for good.<br />  <br />  3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to stay in a <br />  palace and he lived a further 12 years there before eventually <br />  dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style of <br />  disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the head off <br />-<br />  yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years <br />  <br />  4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar of <br />  krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were <br />  frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there was a <br />  sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported through <br />  generous grants by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>,and these grants were further re instated by <br />  kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the mahavamsa <br />  to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed. <br />  <br />  5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify the <br />  chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming the <br />usng <br />  dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for such a <br />  massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was paying <br />  tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king.</div></blockquote></div>

I <br />had<br />    the<br />        good fortune of attending a talk organised by the singapore<br />    library<br />        last evening - the topic was<br />       <br />        The Imperial Cholas: An 11th Century Example of Regional <br />Power<br />    Play<br />        in Southeast Asia<br />       <br />        the paper was presented by a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow, <br />Mr<br />        Prasanna Weerawardane. &#40; will circulate once i get a copy&#41;.<br />       <br />        While the paper was interesting, there were a few grey areas,<br />      thanks<br />        to the little knowledge i gained by being a part of this <br />group<br />    and<br />        reading the archives i took this up and it was well<br />    appareciated.<br />        listing below: <br />       <br />        The paper projected the cholas as a warring clan - eager to<br />    invade,<br />        raid countries for furthering their interests: <br />       <br />        - examples were cited from the chornicle &#40; culavamsa&#41; - of <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym><br />        taking back untold treasures, pillage the anuradhapura vihara<br />    etc.<br />        - unlike other campaigns - the cholas wanted to annexe lanka <br />for<br />      its<br />        resources.<br />        - the cholas ill treated the royal women and took away king<br />    mahinda<br />        IV and his wife to madura where he died.<br />       <br />        - the first attack on srivijaya by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> was because they went <br />on<br />    a<br />        specific disinformation on the chola power - leading to the<br />    first<br />        envoy from chola land being treated as an insignificant <br />kingdom<br />    by<br />        the sung dynasty.<br />        - the profits from these raids were used to shower gifts on <br />the<br />    big<br />        temple<br />        - the second raid on srivijaya by kullottunga was caused by <br />the<br />        srilankan king seeking his aid to fight the cholas - the help<br />    was<br />      by<br />        providing products from the peninsula to aid the srilankan<br />    army/pay<br />        for their expenses. the attack was against this aid.<br />        - the buddhist viharam in nagapatinam was set up bascially to<br />      attact<br />        trade.<br />       <br />        while it was heartening to note the amount of interest the<br />    cholas<br />        still hold among the intellectual faternity here, my <br />arguments<br />    were<br />        as below: <br />       <br />        1. The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period <br />and<br />    the<br />        incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did <br />interfere<br />    in<br />        the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations <br />with<br />      the<br />        pandya crown.<br />       <br />        2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya <br />diadems -<br />        which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his<br />    state.<br />      so<br />        the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by<br />        closing out the pandya for good.<br />       <br />        3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to <br />stay<br />    in a<br />        palace and he lived a further 12 years there before <br />eventually<br />        dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style <br />of<br />        disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the <br />head<br />    off<br />      -<br />        yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years<br />       <br />        4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar <br />of<br />        krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were<br />        frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there <br />was<br />    a<br />        sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported<br />    through<br />        generous grants by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>,and these grants were further re <br />instated<br />    by<br />        kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the<br />    mahavamsa<br />        to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed.<br />       <br />        5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify <br />the<br />        chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming <br />the<br />      usng<br />        dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for <br />such<br />    a<br />        massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was <br />paying<br />        tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king.<br />       <br />     <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />     <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  -- <br />  with luv & regards,<br />  siva<br />  <br />  ever tried. ever failed. no matter.<br />  try again. fail again. fail better.<br />  -- Samuel Beckett<br />  <br />  Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com<br />  Journal: sivaramsk.livejournal.com</div></blockquote></div>
