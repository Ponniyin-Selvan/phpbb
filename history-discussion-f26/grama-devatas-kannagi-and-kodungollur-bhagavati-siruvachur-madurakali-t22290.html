			<div class="content">Connection between Mathurakaaliyamman temple of Siruvachur and <br />Kannagi is also establised.<br /><br />Kannagi after her vengence against Madurai, visited many places <br />for 'Shanthi'. She once came to Srivachur, the temple then <br />was 'Selliyamman temple'. <br /><br />There was a 'poosari' in selliyamman temple, who had obtained a <br />promise from the goddess that she should do as he wishes. Mother <br />compasionate, gave her consent. The 'Poosari' started performing <br />atrocities, and Selliyamman could not bear it, but she could not do <br />anything because of the promise.<br /><br />During this time, when the 'Poosari' was away on his duties, Kannagi <br />visited the temple, and she found Goddess Selliyamman, very muich <br />unhappy. She then was told by Goddess what happened. Kannagi, with <br />the permission of Seliyamman, requested 'Madhuraiyaritha Kaali', to <br />help her. Kaali, then requested Selliyamman, to go to a nearest hill <br />and stay up there, and she will occupy her position here in the <br />temple.<br /><br />The 'Poosari' who retuned to temple after his job, was surprised and <br />shocked to find Kaali, with all her fury sitting in place of <br />Selliyamman. Knowing his end, he requested his samadhi to be in the <br />temple, and people to stamp over his body and worship her, and Kaali <br />to stay parmanently at this temple. Kaali granted his wishes.<br /><br />Below the steps of moolasthaanam, si belived to be that 'Poosari's' <br />samadhi.<br /><br />So Siruvachur became famous for Madhurakaali and still Selliyamman <br />occupies a temple in nearby hill.<br /><br />So Sirivachur has 2000 years old history.<br /><br />Rajendhra Cholan!<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Elango"  <br />  wrote:<br />    I recollect an article on "Om Shakthi" magazine &#40;early 90s&#41; <br />linking<br />    Kannagi with Kodungollur Bhagavati.<br />    <br />    The author of that article had given multiple evidence to relate <br />  this<br />    temple with Kannagi.<br />    <br />    1.
