			<div class="content">Reading thru these messages, i am not sure what exactly is bravery...<br /><br />As in purananuru - mother searching for her son in the battlefield<br />looking for the wound in chest - is the son brave? He had the nerve and<br />he was fearless and had the guts to face death which is probably the<br />boldest gesture by any one and something that is not achievable by many.<br /><br />But is that being brave?<br /><br />I believe being brave is to accomplish the path of justice in the time<br />of darkness. Being dead wont count as success in the path. The true<br />brave person is a hero, fights a battle with the mind and does not lose<br />it. The hero, takes time to plan and strategically conquers the task. He<br />may lose the battle but end up winning the war. Hero's do not quit.<br /><br />Will those who have ran away from the battle field but come back to win<br />wars counted as brave or cowards ?<br /><br />When smart guys run for the moment , the bards sing praise of the ruler<br />calling him the brave, when the scene reverses , the same bards glorify<br />the return.<br /><br />So who really is brave ?<br /><br />Vali or Sugreeva ? Pulikesi or Narasimha ?<br /><br />- - R<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vijay, thank you once again, great summary!!

Inscriptions quoted from Kailasanathar <br />Temple, Kanchi. <br /><br />They are classified as a mixed race of BRAHMA-KSHATRIYAS !<br /><br />I will go through Dr. Ma.Raasamanickanar's Pallvar varalaru also and <br />revert later.<br /><br />That apart, the " HIRANYA VARMAN " - has FIRST CONSTRUCTED the <br />CHIDAMBARAM TEMPLE. Vijay can refer THILLAI by B. Natarajan s/o<br />Historian SRB and confirm. <br /><br />He hesitates to identify him as Pallava to begin with !<br /><br />Well .. that is History ...<br /><br />thanks once again.. <br /><br />best regards / sps<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "shed_naresh200" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>KADAVARAYARS<br />  <br />  They claim to be the descendants of the Pallavas and hence known <br />as <br />  Kadavas.

Once his weight suddenly <br />seemed to have greatly increased. Shesha asked Vishnu "why are you <br />so much heavier, Lord?" The Lord answered "I have had a vision of <br />Shiva dancing his Cosmic Dance. I have expanded with happiness at <br />the sight." Shesha requested Vishnu to tell him all about Shiva's <br />Dance. And Lord Preserver told him everything.<br /><br />In the forest called Daruvanna live a community of Rishis or Seers <br />in a hermitage. Through the performance of rituals they had achieved <br />great knowledge and power, but they had not realized the importance <br />of Divine Grace. Shiva requested Vishnu to accompany him to <br />enlighten the Rishis, by showing them human power and knowledge were <br />helpless without Divine Grace. To accomplish this purpose the two <br />deities applied their power of Maya or Illusion.Shiva entered the <br />hermitage of the Rishis as Bhikshatana or Mendicant. With dazzling <br />beauty, wearing only a mendicant's sandals or padukai, the wives and <br />daughters of the Rishis fell madly in love with him, forgetting <br />everything else, and completely loosing themselves. ( There are some <br />amazingly explicit sculptures of this episode in kudimiyanmalai - as <br />well as in kanchi)<br /><br />Vishnu transformed himself into a beautiful woman called Mohini, and <br />an alluring dancer. As soon as the Rishis saw Mohini dance before <br />them, they too lost all sense and rationality and with desire <br />burning in their hearts they followed Mohini around like madmen.<br />( again sculptures in kanchi abound)<br /><br />When some of the Rishis realized what was happening they became <br />enraged and started a great magical fire sacrifice against Shiva-<br />Bhikshatana. First they called from the fire tiger, but when it <br />attacked Lord Shiva he laughed, and killed the ferocious animal with <br />his hands, tearing off its skin and wearing it for a loincloth. Next <br />the Rishis send poisonous snakes, which he draped around his arms <br />and neck, as jewelry. Then Shiva prepared to perform his Cosmic <br />Dance. His two other arms appeared and his third eye shone in his <br />forehead. The Rishis called a fierce dwarf from their magical fire, <br />but Shiva's dancing foot simply took him for a pedestal and danced. <br />Finally the Rishis send the fire itself to destroy the Cosmic <br />Dancer, but he just took it on to his left hand. And from the <br />mantras that the Rishis used against him he made his anklets. Then <br />the Lord danced his Tandava or Cosmic Dance.<br /><br />Its full power made the Rishis fall to the ground. It made Vishnu <br />shake, and even Parvati, the goddess consort of Shiva, who joined <br />them to witness her husbands dance, was overcome with fear. But the <br />Lord danced smiling, showing his raised foot. The Rishis understood <br />the Lord's Divine Grace, and attained realization. They started to <br />dance themselves and all of creation danced with them.<br /><br />After Vishnu has told Shesha about his vision of Shiva's Cosmic <br />Dance, Shesha longs for only one thing: to see Shiva's dance <br />himself. Vishnu grants him permission to leave him for a while, so <br />Shesha too will be able to experience Shiva's dance.<br /><br />After Shesha performed austerities for long ages, Shiva appeared <br />before him, and offers him the fulfillment of any wish. Shesha has <br />only one wish: to witness Shiva's Tandava.<br /><br /><br />Once meditating on his dance<br />vishnu's body doubled in weight<br />and sesha his support, had his body squeezed<br />sesha drank the wine of what had happened<br />from the lotus of vishnu's mouth<br />and practising very severe penance<br />reached his holy place<br />via the tunnel mouth of the silver mountain<br />and witnessed the dance in the sabha..<br /><br /><br />In fulfillment of Shesha's wish, Shiva announced to him that he will <br />dance at the appropriate and tangible moment on earth in the Sabha <br />in the Tillai forest. This forest is situated on the middle point of <br />the earth, and constituted its heart centre, the Lotus Space. <br />Through it passes the main energy nadi, or vein, of our mother <br />planet. This place is called Cit Ambara, the Ether of Consciousness. <br />Shiva told that he, Shesha, would be born on earth from human <br />parents, and that he would be called Patanjali. After growing up he <br />will travel to Tillai, where he will meet another saint, called <br />Vyagrapada the Tigerfooted. And both will perform tapas and worship, <br />until the appointed time for Shiva to perform his Cosmic Dance in <br />the Sabha has arrived.<br /><br />All these things foretold by Shiva to Shesha come to pass. As <br />Patanjali reached the Tillai forest he found on the southern bank of <br />the lotus pond the saint Vyagrapada, worshipping the Mulasthana <br />Linga and performing austerities. Vyagrapada had come to the Tillai <br />forest following the advice of his father, the Rishi Madhyandina. To <br />worship the Mulasthana Linga he used to gather flowers in the early <br />morning, but however early he collected the flowers, insects had <br />already damaged them. Deeply upset that his worship was not as <br />complete or perfect as he aimed for, he cried to Lord Shiva to help <br />him. In answer to his prayer Shiva gave him tiger claws for hand and <br />feet, enabling him to find his way through the thick forest at night <br />to gather flowers long before daybreak, before the insects could <br />inflict their damage.<br /><br />once madhyadhana's son,<br />worshipping shiva's excellant linga<br />obtained by his grace the paws of a tiger<br />through his compassion <br />he was able to bring to his son<br />the ocean of milk and feed him on it<br />and he beheld in the hall<br />his supreme dance<br /><br /><br />From then on both saints did the worship and the austerities <br />together, as they waited for the appointed time for Shiva to dance <br />in the Sabha. As that time approached also the 3000 munivars (later <br />called Deekshithars) arrived in the forest to await the Lord's dance.<br /><br />When that day arrived, it was announced with the sound of drums and <br />conches. A rain of flowers fell from heaven, and in the Sabha <br />appeared a light of a thousand suns and moons. In the middle of this <br />light mass appeared Shiva's form, dancing his Ananda Tandava, and <br />showing his Lotus Foot. His is an un-earthly beauty, while his <br />peaceful smile shines on all. He was together with Parvati, who <br />witnessed his dance. All those present, Devatas, demons and humans <br />rejoiced, almost fainting, and all joined in his dance, dancing <br />themselves.<br /><br />Then Shiva offered the two saints to make a wish. They wished that <br />Shiva would forever perform his Ananda Tandava or Dance of Bliss in <br />the golden Sabha of Chidambaram, for the entire world to experience. <br />So that any human who desired this could also reach His lifted Lotus <br />Foot and realize liberation.<br /><br />From umapathi sivachariya's account<br /><br />In the beginning<br />on a full moon thursday in the month of the deer<br />under the pushya lunar asterism<br />to fulfill the promise<br />won by those wonderful sages asceticism<br /><br />he summoned the snake bodied patanjali<br />and the great sage, tiger footed vyagrapada<br /><br />and performed his dance<br />against the wall<br />in the blessed hall of consiousness<br /><br />and after it was over<br />he granted them permanent residence<br /><br /><br />There is also the legend of brahma's great sacrifice, the priests of <br />thillai leaving to attend this sacrifice...<br /><br /><br />when indra was summoned <br />to the self born brahma's sacrifice in antarvedi<br />where the hymns of the sama veda were sung loudly<br />he did not come<br /><br />as soon as brahma learned that he lord of the gods<br />was watching his pure dance<br />brahma went himself in great haste to indra<br /><br />and by his overruling command<br />brought him back along with the brahmans<br />and performed his sacrifice<br />amid the praises of gods..<br /><br />( antarvadi - area within the sacrifical ground - is the doab - the <br />district between the ganga and yamnu - a region of particular <br />sanctity) the above translation is basically to justify the northern <br />origin of the 3000.<br /><br />there is also the legend connected with the rathnasabapathi<br /><br />brahma of a hundred sacrifices<br />performed a great sacrifice in antarvadi<br />a sacrifice that took a thousand years to complete<br />in that assembly at vyagrapadha's behest<br />the chief ascetics were present<br /><br />so that they could continue to worship him<br />he gladly sent a dancer made of precious stone<br />arisen from the best of fires<br /><br />he is the source of that image<br />his crown is on nine jewels<br />his foot is curved<br />i worship him...<br /><br />( siva to compensate for the 3000 for their absence from the temple <br />during the sacrifice gives them the ruby nataraja)<br /><br /><br />lastly the verse about the king<br /><br />simhavarman, the load of gauda<br />distressed by his diseased body,<br />came from his own land<br />to be cured of his affliction<br /><br />by bathing in the excellant water<br />with its clumps of golden lotuses<br />thereupon becoming<br />the blessed hemavarman<br /><br />witnessing in the company of the best ascetics<br />the dance of sambhu, siva the mild<br />for whom he built <br />a wonderful jewelled temple....<br /><br /><br /><br />Soon after the king Sveta Varman came to the Tillai forest. This <br />king was forced to give up his kingdom after being infected with a <br />skin disease called `white spot', a form of leprosy. Lord Nataraja <br />ordered the two saints Vyagrapada and Patanjali to let the king take <br />a bath in the lotus pond, now called the Shiva Ganga, that he may be <br />healed. After re-emerging from the water the king's skin had become <br />golden, his name becoming Hiranya Varman or `golden coloured'. And <br />he was taken to the Sabha to see Nataraja's Ananda Tandava. <br />Overtaken with emotions the king fell on earth and offered his life-<br />long service to the Dancing Shiva.<br /><br />He was consecrated by the 3000 munivars, and received from <br />Vyagrapada the Tiger banner, signifying his kingship and valor. The <br />king then rebuild beautifully the temple and the city around it. And <br />established the main festivals of the yearly cycle in the temple.<br /><br />another version, is that vyagrapadha and his wife, adopted the <br />prince. At that momement fromthe clouds descened the voice of his <br />fathers guru vasista, calling his back to his duties as his father <br />is aged. he does not want to leave, so vyagrapadha advised him to <br />move his army and subjects to the south, and also to bring back the <br />3000 - he does so and constructs the temple...patanjali himself <br />writes a text on the rituals of the temple - a manual for the <br />dikshitars. <br /><br />legend also states there was a third ( apart from vyagrapadha and <br />patanjai) who watched the dance - Jamini who watched the dance.<br /><br />In the beginning the blessed lord of serpents<br />patanjali takeing percepts<br />from the various places in the endless scriptures<br />in a way that none could emulate<br />composed the sutra for worship, festivals and aspersions,<br />of the dancer<br /><br />so that in the way that he has stated<br />the three thousand brahmans forever<br />honor the lord of dancers....<br /><br />hiranya varman took the book around the city to the sound of <br />trumpets and installed it in the sabha. there is also a version that <br />jamini also wrote a manual - so there were two books??</div>
