			<div class="content">the full story or is it...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://randorguy.galatta.com/blog/randorguy/Lakshmikantham-">http://randorguy.galatta.com/blog/rando ... mikantham-</a><!-- m --><br />Murde/bdid/309.html<br /><br />November 8, 1944Â… Madras, a sea-kissed sunny city founded some 350 <br />plus years ago by an employee of the East India Company, Francis <br />Day, the provincial capital woke up as usual as the resplendent sun <br />rose<br />out of the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal. To one of its <br />citizens,named C. N. Lakshmikantham, a colorful character of <br />considerable notoriety, a popular journalist of the 'yellow' variety <br />it would be his last day on this planet. Only he was blissfully <br />ignorant of it all. Indeed if someone had told him so that day-<br />break he would have<br />laughed it off, mixing it with some rich colorful two-letter Tamil <br />words (the equivalent of the English four-lettered ones!) and most <br />likely he would have slapped that bold someone! Such was the man, <br />the<br />earliest of yellow journalists, the prince of muck-rakers.<br /><br />After finishing his mundane morning chores this go-getter was on his <br />way in a man drawn rickshaw to meet his lawyer an Indian Christian <br />who looked more like a Shakespearean actor with his wavy hair, long<br />side-burns and all named J. Nargunam. At that time he had only a <br />modest practice and lived on Maddox Street, Vepery, not very far <br />from where Lakshmikantham lived in a narrow house-lined street in <br />nearby<br />Purasawalkam. The client and lawyer were good friends and met <br />almost every evening after court hours.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham was quite a court-bird. And a big of a jailbird too. <br />Indeed his pre-journalist life reads like a chapter from a best <br />selling suspense thriller. He had ambitions of becoming a lawyer,<br />something he loved but he could not afford to go to Law College.  <br />Yet he did not forget it and read law books. He frequented law <br />courts of Madras city and hobnobbed with small fry lawyers, <br />briefless, breadless<br />ones and litigants of the illiterate kind. Clever and quick-witted <br />he soon became a law tout. Touts though prohibited by law are men <br />who take cases and other legal matters to lawyers for a substantial<br />'kick-back' in the fee. Patronised by briefless and struggling <br />lawyers some touts in Madras with a smattering of legal knowledge <br />earn more than most lawyers. They draft deeds and documents, wills <br />and<br />notices mostly for illiterates and some touts resort to forgery and <br />fabricating documents very casually of course, for a stiff fee.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham was one such tout and smart enough to argue his own <br />cases in court. One of his shady deals involving the fabrication of <br />a sworn affidavit created by him in a case filed against him by a<br />leading Madras daily found him in the dock in the Madras High Court <br />Original Sessions. During the hearing he escaped hoodwinking a <br />posse of cops and for a while he lived a happy-go-lucky life, until <br />the cops<br />nabbed and brought him to trial. Found guilty he received a 7 year <br />jail sentence and was ordered to be imprisoned at Rajamundry, then <br />in Madras presidency and now in Andhra Pradesh. While the train <br />taking<br />him was crossing a river in Andhra he, hand-chained, managed to <br />escape fooling the guarding cops and jumped from the chug-chugging <br />train into the river below shrouded by darkness. With chains and <br />all he swam<br />across the big river and disappeared into the dark night. He roamed <br />around freely for a long while until an angry girl friend tipped off <br />the searching Madras city cops. Back in custody he was declared <br />a 'dangerous convict' and deported to the Andamans. With an ocean <br />surrounding this famed island prison, Lakshmikantham could not even <br />dream of escape. He served his term until as a war security measure <br />he along with others was set fee and shipped back home.<br /><br />Back in Madras, a notorious ex-convict, he avoided courts and cops <br />for whom he had an understandable allergy! Life had to go on and he <br />dabbled in many things. He ran a small restaurant serving meat <br />dishes<br />which in south India were then known as "military hotels" {Eateries <br />serving only vegetarian food were called 'civil' hotels}. He lost <br />in this venture and looked around for greener pastures. Soon he <br />found<br />one, Journalism. A profession that would bring him money, fame or <br />more precisely notoriety, and a violent end.<br /><br />Around 1943 he launched a film weekly in Tamil "Cinema Thoothu". It <br />was a different kind of magazine. Lakshmikantham did not publish <br />articles about theories and trends in cinema and such. He filled the<br />pages with tales of bedroom activities, amours and amatory <br />adventures of prominent filmland figures like reigning superstar M. <br />K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, brilliant comedian hailed as the 'Charlie <br />Chaplin of<br />India', N. S. Krishnan and his star wife T. A. Mathuram, successful <br />producer S. M. Sreeramulu Naidu and many others enjoying stardom and <br />immense popularity in south India. He ran "series" about <br />Bhagavathar and Krishnan as a weekly feature. He wielded a facile <br />pen and his writing was lively, punchy and enjoyable to read. <br />Bhagavathar, a singing star was then at his zenith of his career and <br />fame. More a singer than an actor his following was incredible.  <br />Masses, classes, intellectuals, upper crust folks, all loved him, <br />his music. Women<br />adored him and many society dames threw themselves at him. Such was <br />his charisma. At this time he was one of the most famous figures of <br />south India, a household name.<br /><br /><br />No wonder, "Cinema Thoothu", the first of its kind was a raving sell-<br />out and copies sold at a premium. The Tamil-speaking world had <br />never seen anything like this weekly. The south Indian society, some<br />forty and odd years ago was conservative, old-fashioned and subjects <br />like sex were strictly taboo and barely whispered. In such rigid, <br />regimented atmosphere not surprisingly people loved gossip and <br />scandal<br />and hungered to read and know all about the goings-on behind closed <br />doors in high places. Movie glamour had already seeped into the <br />skin and soul of society and this wily pen-totter took a hundred-and-<br />ten<br />per cent advantage of it all.<br /><br />What was Lakshmikantham's aim in running such a magazine? He <br />professed, at least in public to be a traditionalist with a <br />missionary zeal to uphold the ideals and high values of ancient <br />Indian culture.<br />He claimed he was socially conscious reformer come to earth, to <br />clean the stables free of sinners and seducers, adulterers and the <br />likes. But his real aim, the sole purpose was blackmail, pure and <br />simple.<br />And surely it paid him ample dividends. Many actors, actresses and <br />cinema men paid him hush money to buy his silence.<br /><br />Some like Bhagavathar complained to the authorities and a memorandum <br />signed by the superstar and other victims of the blackmailer's <br />vitriolic pen was submitted to Sir Arthur Hope the then Governor of<br />Madras. At once he acted and the license for publication was <br />cancelled. However Lakshmikantham was not unduly worried. He <br />instructed his lawyer Nargunam to file an appeal to Delhi. When <br />Delhi<br />did not bother about "Cinema Thoothu" the resourceful fellow <br />utilising past expertise forged and fabricated an order renewing his <br />license! With this fake document he managed to run his paying <br />magazine for some<br />weeks. When the situation turned hot he gave up "Cinema Thoothu".  <br />He searched around and soon found a tottering weekly named "Hindu <br />Nesan". Its objective and theme were to uphold Hindu culture, <br />tradition,<br />values and such. It suited Lakshmikantham and he took it over.<br /><br />"Hindu Nesan" clicked at once and its new editor expanded his target <br />list of victims. Besides movie people he wrote salacious scandalous <br />stories about business magnates, prosperous lawyers and doctors,<br />popular musicians, feudal landlords and landed gentry, press barons <br />and idle rich, religious heads and even small fry if there was a <br />chance to bleed them. Every scandal tinted with sex was grist to his<br />mill and that spelt money.<br /><br />'Hush money' poured in and soon Lakshmikantham acquired property, <br />like houses, land and gold and a printing press. Soon he was <br />elevated to the status of cult figure in Madras. Most of the stuff <br />he wrote was<br />partly true and his writing acquired a sheen of credibility adding <br />to his popularity. He was smart enough to know that every cupboard <br />had its skeletons and he searched for them!<br /><br />Victims, like Bhagavathar tried to buy his silence but <br />Lakshmikantham was too smart to yield to such tactics. Some again, <br />like Bhagavathar hired hooligans to beat him up, but he the bigger <br />hooligan of them all<br />proved too tough, and he beat them up! One such hired goonda was a <br />rowdy, a milkman by profession who had supplied milk to the <br />Lakshmikantham family. His name was Nagalingam.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham knew he had enemies of many a kind, big and small.  <br />So for a short while he hired a bodyguard to protect him. That man <br />was a well- known weightlifter, boxer who ran a gymnasium for <br />sometime. He was a staunch Hindu and had played a role in Hindu-<br />Muslim riots. He also played roles in movies as stuntman. His name <br />was Sreenivasulu Naidu, better known as Arya Veera Seenan!<br /><br />"Hindu Nesan" not only became a best-selling weekly but also a much-<br />talked about one. Of course, in most homes the crudely produced <br />weekly printed on cheap paper, the entire contents of which were<br />written by the wily editor himself was read on the sly, in privacy <br />like toilets and bedrooms. But almost every adult talked about the <br />stories in the weekly, their authenticity and all that. Though very<br />few had seen the muck-peddler, he was almost a household name at <br />least for a brief period.<br /><br />And then Lakshmikantham announced that a new sensational story would <br />be featured from a particular date in his weekly. A no-holds-barred <br />expose one a sensational but unsolved killing known as 'The Boat Mail<br />Murder'. 'The Boat Mail' was a fast running train from Madras to <br />Dhanushkodi, serving as a link for ships from India to Sri Lanka. <br />Hence, the name. In that train, a rich banker, a moneybag, <br />Lakshmanan<br />Chettiar, was brutally murdered as the mail steamed its way to <br />Madras tearing through the dark night. Who killed the wealthy man? <br />To this day, half a century later, it remains a mystery, unsolved.  <br />The murder<br />rocked the province and many bigwigs were said to be behind it. The <br />killing, a bloody one, allegedly took place in the presence of an <br />eye-witness, a popular singer-actress, but somehow the truth never<br />surfaced nor was it permitted, the public felt. Lakshmikantham wrote <br />that he would reveal the names of the killers in the very first <br />issue.<br /><br />That issue of "Hindu Nesan" never came out! Before it could <br />Lakshmikantham went out of this wide, wicked world and his exit was <br />set in motion that day, November 8, 1944!<br /><br />Lakshmikantham had a tenant living in one of his houses. He was a <br />hired help in type-composing in one of the top English dailies of <br />Madras and his widowed sister-in-law kept house for him.<br />Lakshmikantham took a dislike to his tenant, maybe because the man <br />came from a lowly depressed community. Anyway he wanted him to <br />vacate his house but the press-worker refused. Enraged the house-<br />owner<br />published titillating tit-bits in 'Hindu Nesan' about the tenant and <br />his buxom sister-in-law who the editor suggested in his racy Tamil <br />took good care of the man of many more things not merely the house!<br />Consequently the two men fought in streets, exchanging blows with <br />the scandal-sheet scribe getting knifed in the process. He also <br />filed a case of trespass and succeeding in it he tried to take <br />possession of<br />his house, throwing and breaking things like mirrors, chairs and <br />pots in the process.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham filed a criminal complaint against his tenant for <br />assault but the cops did not take notice of it. So he briefed his <br />lawyer to file a private complaint against that damned low-born<br />fellow. His name was Vadivelu.<br /><br />That fateful morning Lakshmikantham carried legal papers connected <br />with this case and Nargunam and he discussed the matter, seated in <br />the upstairs office-room of his bungalow. Then the lawyer took <br />leave of<br />his friend asking him to meet him later in court and he went in to <br />get ready to go to court. Lakshmikantham walked out towards his <br />rickshaw. The "puller" was missing for a while and then he got into <br />the<br />man-drawn-vehicle, destination home, sweet home.<br /><br />Maddox street winds along a narrow, lonely deserted curve and ends <br />in General Collins Road, a quiet street of garden houses and <br />spacious bungalows only on one side. The other side was vacant <br />land, and<br />playgrounds. In 1944 there was not much of traffic in that part of <br />Vepery. Madras City, itself was then only a small city of some half <br />a million people as against five million and more of today.<br /><br />While the rickshaw moved down that curve with no houses around, <br />suddenly some men, - how many nobody was sure Â– appeared and zeroed <br />in on the vehicle, toppling it. One of them pulled out a knife and<br />stabbed Lakshmikantham and as suddenly as they appeared they<br />disappeared running in different directions.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham bleeding and groaning in severe pain got up and with <br />his hands pressed to the wounded area, he walked back to his <br />lawyer's house. By now, Nargunam who had heard about the stabbing <br />from some<br />passers-by had come out of the house. The two met on the street <br />when Lakshmikantham told him about the attack. What did he say?  <br />According to the lawyer's evidence in court, the Tamil word his <br />client used was<br />"Avan" (which means "he"). Whom did he refer to by "he"?<br /><br />{Years later in the early 1970s when the writer was researching on <br />this case, Nargunam told him emphatically that the word <br />Lakshmikantham used was "Evano!" which means "someone"! "Avan" <br />and "Evan" are<br />phonetically similar and that's how the confusion arose he <br />explained. When asked why he did not tell the court, what he told <br />the writer, Nargunam merely shrugged it all off!}<br /><br />Anyway, Nargunam put Lakshmikantham in another rickshaw and asked <br />him to go to the General Hospital, the biggest at that time, a mile <br />away. He also requested a client of his, Mr. Brew, an Anglo-Indian, <br />who<br />happened to pass by, to go along with the injured man. Brew <br />followed in another rickshaw and now Lakshmikantham bleeding and <br />bound for the General Hospital instructed his rickshaw-man to take <br />him to the Vepery police station situated nearby.<br /><br />Sub-inspector Krishnan Nambiyar came out, on being informed by Brew <br />and met the bleeding man seated in the vehicle. Now, Brew left and <br />went about his work. What exactly took place at the station was <br />never<br />clear for the police version was questioned later in court during <br />the sensational trial and a study of the trial papers does not <br />convey the impression that the truth did not come out. Or it was not <br />permitted to<br />as many believed then and continue to do so to this day.<br /><br />According to Nambiyar, Lakshmikantham complained speaking in English <br />about the stabbing attack on him and while he spoke Nambiyar took it <br />all down on a piece of white paper. This was something unusual even<br />odd, for under the police procedure and law, such complaints should <br />be written in a book maintained for that purpose and not on bits of <br />paper. But the cop had an explanation. As the man was too injured to<br />have left the vehicle he took down what he narrated on a sheet of <br />paper under the circumstances. Nambiyar had to stand, one foot on <br />the rickshaw, paper and pad resting on his thigh, and write which <br />would<br />have been impossible if he had to bring that bulky book and write it <br />all down in triplicate using carbon sheets!<br /><br />After he wrote it all down, Lakshmikantham read it and signed it at <br />the bottom, or did he? If so, when and where? Indeed this <br />important document became an issue later during the trial. And, not <br />without<br />reason!<br /><br />In that complaint, the name Vadivelu and 'another man', aged 30, <br />were mentioned as the assailants. Lakshmikantham, however never <br />identified, nor named his attackers at any time before he died the <br />morning after. Indeed when he was treated at the out-patient ward of <br />the General Hospital by Dr. A. K. Joseph, he stated that he had no <br />idea of who his attacker was. In the register maintained by the <br />hospital the relevant<br />entry read "Name of assailant Â– Not known".<br /><br />Again, later, when Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan, the house surgeon who <br />treated Lakshmikantham as an in-patient talked to him the 'yellow' <br />journalist stated he did not know who the assailant was. If so, how<br />did the name Vadivelu appear in that sheet?<br /><br />In Nagalingam, the rowdyish milkman who was later arrested and <br />charged as the second assailant was really the person, why did <br />Lakshmikantham mention about a person aged 30. Nagalingam had been <br />his milkman and<br />known him for years. If so, why did not he name Nagalingam as the <br />second culprit? Was Nagalingam not there that morning? Vadivelu? <br />Was he there, or not?<br /><br />To confuse matters there were corrections and over-writings and <br />such, even inks of different colours in what Nambiyar wrote!<br /><br />{C.Ramanna, a Madras City lawyer, with a modest practice whom <br />Vadivelu had consulted about his house tenancy problem told the <br />writer years later a startling story which he swore was as true <br />as 'the sun-rise<br />every dawn'. When Lakshmikantham was stabbed that ill-fated morning <br />alleged to be by Vadivelu, the poor press-worker was seated in a <br />chair in his office! So, the lawyer argued it was impossible that <br />my client<br />Vadivelu stabbed that fellow. Why did he not tell the police about <br />this steel-strong alibi? The lawyer had a shocking tale to tellÂ….<br /><br />He did speak to the city top cops but they shut their ears, eyes and <br />all senses. When he persisted they threatened to rope him in, <br />arrest and charge him as accused. How? The cops had a theory.<br />Lakshmikantham wrote about a newspaper baron and his affair with a <br />leading singer-actress and that VIP and this lawyer were related. <br />Besides, Vadivelu worked in that big shot's press! So, the cops<br />hinted the baron had asked his lawyer relative to rub off <br />Lakshmikantham and he in turn fixed up his client Vadivelu and heÂ…! <br />The shocked lawyer raced back home and went about his other<br />business!}.<br /><br />And that was not all. There were more matters creating and casting <br />long and strong shadows of doubts in the police and prosecution <br />version of the case.<br /><br />For example, the weapon, a knife, or dagger as it was described. <br />According to the rickshawman, Gopal, he picked up the blood-stained <br />knife and the legal papers Lakshmikantham had with him, equally<br />stained and took them to Nargunam. Strangely, the lawyer took the <br />papers and told Gopal to hand over the knife at the Vepery police <br />station. Why did he keep back the papers which were also important<br />evidence, like the knife? Nargunam could not offer any valid <br />explanation either during the trial in the witness-box or years <br />later to the writer.<br /><br />An important point he did clarify to the writer was his conduct <br />after he saw his client with the bleeding stab injuries. <br />Lakshmikantham had been his friend and client, and a frequent <br />visitor to his house. Why,<br />then did he not take him to the nearest doctor at once, or having <br />failed to do so, why did he not accompany his friend and client to <br />the General Hospital instead of sending Brew, ho came along that way <br />by<br />sheer accident? He was cross-examined during the trial by defense <br />lawyers but his answer was far from convincing. Years later he gave <br />the writer a convincing explanation. He found that the injuries were<br />simple and certainly not so serious to warrant his personal and <br />immediate attention. Moreover, he was anxious to avoid getting <br />involved with sordid attacks on a shady character which he knew his<br />client certainly was!<br /><br />His evaluation of the injuries as simple tallied with that of S. I. <br />Nambiyar's. And, also that of the victim himself. The police <br />officer had noted in the case register the nature of the injuries as <br />simple,<br />and he registered a case only for 'simple hurt' under the Indian <br />Penal Code.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham too should have felt the same way explaining why he <br />chose to visit the police station first without rushing to the <br />Hospital as urged by his lawyer.<br /><br />Dr. Joseph too had the same opinion when he treated the injured man <br />at the out-patient ward.<br /><br />Another issue of confusion, - and doubt -, was the knife. According <br />to the police case, Gopal handed over the weapon to Nambiyar. Under <br />the rules the receipt of the knife should have been entered in a<br />property register, immediately by the station clerk. But no such <br />entry about this knife was found noted in that book! Why not? <br />Nambiyar offered vague replies under cross-examination and ventured <br />to<br />suggest that such procedure was not always followed! A perusal of <br />the Vepery police station register revealed that even insignificant <br />items, like onions, eggs and such were recorded, but this blood-<br />stained knife<br />was not. Why not? Was there no such knife at all? Were Gopal and <br />Nambiyar spinning yarns? Was the knife a fake, not the real one, <br />but something introduced later by the cops?<br /><br />What of Gopal? Was he really an eye-witness to the attack, as he <br />claimed to be. The defense case was that he had run away, scared to <br />death as soon as his rickshaw was toppled. There is strong force <br />behind this theory. After Lakshmikantham was stabbed he a man with <br />knife injuries bleeding and shocked came walking groaning and <br />moaning towards his lawyer's house. Why did he not come in that <br />rickshaw.<br />Was it because that Gopal was not around to help the victim, having <br />run away to safety? Indeed Gopal came with his vehicle towards the <br />place on the street where the lawyer and the victim stood only <br />minutes<br />later. All these suggest strongly that Gopal was no eye-witness as <br />put by the police and his evidence not based on truth.<br /><br />However, Lakshmikantham accompanied by a cop sent by Nambiyar <br />reached the General Hospital where Dr. Joseph attended on him and <br />also spoke about the attack based on which he made those entries in <br />the<br />'casualty' register. Interestingly the prosecution did not choose <br />to call Dr. Joseph to give evidence at the trial in spite of the <br />pressure by the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Vere Mockett (later Sir <br />Vere<br />Mockett). Somewhat exasperated the honorable High Court Judge <br />summoned this young doctor to as a court witness to tender evidence. <br />Why did the prosecution fight shy? The explanation was unconvincing.<br /><br />At the GH Lakshmikantham was beginning to feel uneasy and the <br />bleeding from the injury in the abdomen did not cease. So he was <br />admitted as an in-patient for further treatment in the Wenlock ward <br />under a<br />well-known surgeon of the day, Dr. Nadkarni Mangesh Rao, one of the <br />senior Indian doctors of Madras.<br /><br />Around this period Nargunam visited the hospital twice. He deposed <br />in court that the first time he found that his friend had not <br />reached the hospital and on the second visit, Lakshmikantham was in <br />poor condition<br />and taking a turn for the worse.<br /><br />{However, some quarter-century later the lawyer told the writer a<br />different tale which he declared was the undiluted truth. When he<br />went to the GH, he did meet Lakshmikantham whom he found in bed but<br />hale and hearty. He cracked obscene jokes in Tamil about those "sons<br />of whores" who dared to attack him. He would get out of GH in a day<br />or two and would teach all those bastards a fitting lesson and show<br />who Lakshmikantham really was! Nargunam laughed enjoying his <br />friend's<br />two-lettered Tamil abuses and left promising to visit him next <br />morning<br />on his way to court. His shock when he heard about Lakshmikantham's<br />death knew no bounds for he never expected it. "I never even dreamt<br />he would die!" he remarked his voice dropping to a heavy whisper.}<br /><br />Whatever happened to Lakshmikantham at the GH? Something that ended<br />his eventful, exciting life. Something, now very clear, discussed<br />hotly then, both in and out of courts and even today almost half a<br />century later.<br /><br />When the bleeding did not stop Dr. Mangesh Rao wondered if the <br />patient<br />had suffered any serious internal injury like damage to the<br />peritoneum. He felt an exploration of the abdominal wound was<br />necessary. So he instructed his assistant Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan to<br />do the needful as he was busy otherwise engaged in serious cases!  <br />But<br />the problem Dr. Balakrishnan found that the blood pressure of the<br />patient had dropped very low and promptly he informed his senior of<br />the condition. Dr. Rao felt that an exploration of the wound under<br />such low blood pressure would prove fatal and told his assistant<br />against it and suggested some treatment to stop the bleeding.<br /><br />Yet, Dr. Balakrishnan did perform an exploration on Lakshmikantham.<br />Why did he do it? No answer was ever found and Dr. Balakrishnan<br />carried the truth to his grave. He did offer an explanation but it<br />satisfied none. Anyway his surgical exploration created another<br />wound, the second one. This two-wound situation figured prominently<br />at the trial casting doubts on the prosecution case. Indeed the<br />defense openly suggested that the cause of the death was the<br />exploration and not the stab wound.<br /><br />An examination of the patient's urine revealed blood, indicating<br />damage to the kidney. There was no clear proof about the condition <br />of<br />the urine before Lakshmikantham was wheeled into the operation<br />theater. What had caused the damage? The surgical exploration?<br /><br />Interestingly and perhaps, sadly, no defense lawyer categorically<br />asked questions whether the blade of the knife could have reached the<br />kidney and cut it into two! All the counsel were very eminent <br />lawyers<br />of standing, skills and experience but nobody pursued that line. One<br />wonders why?<br /><br />The news about the attack on Lakshmikantham hit the city like a storm<br />and crowds in large numbers gathered inside the hospital grounds,<br />corridors and almost everywhere and police had a tough time<br />maintaining order. It became the talk of the town, and wild stories<br />began to circulate about the identity of the assailant or assailants,<br />nobody was sure, not even the cops at this juncture Â– and the people<br />behind it.<br /><br />As night fell, Lakshmikantham took a turn for the worse. He became<br />delirious and in the early hours of the following morn, at about <br />4.15,<br />November 9, 1944, he died, due to secondary shock caused by damage to<br />the kidney. It was all over. A life of stir and sensation,<br />excitement and escapes had ended. An ex-con who had been a thorn in<br />many a flesh, had been eliminated. A case of simple hurt had ended <br />in<br />murder. A hornet's nest had been stirred.<br /><br />Who did it? Nobody really knows.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham had been elevated to the status of a martyr. His <br />death<br />rocked south India, and his funeral became an event. His body was<br />laid on a bench in the front area of his house in Purasawalkam for<br />public view, and thousands of men, women and even kids thronged to <br />pay<br />homage to him. Floral wreaths were laid at his feet, and many women<br />who had never known or seen him wept beating their breasts wailing<br />loudly. Mass hysteria reigned during the funeral. A poor man, an<br />ordinary man, who took cudgels to cleanse society had been eliminated<br />by the sinful haves, the sadistic rich, the bigwigs. That was the<br />feeling that filled the air, as thousands followed the funeral<br />procession. That day, C. N. Lakshmikantham, dead and cold, was the<br />most talked-about person in Madras. A raging world war, a voilent<br />freedom struggle, shortage of essential commodities, all were<br />forgotten by people.<br /><br />Police Inspector Keshava Menon took over the investigation of the<br />murder at once. Frankly he had no clue of any kind. Stories<br />circulated in the Maddox street Â– General Collins Road area of a <br />group<br />of three persons, or four was seen running around the time of attack.<br />And the hunt for that 'gang of three' began in right earnest!<br /><br />The police had known about the enemity between the murdered man, and<br />the press-worker, Vadivelu. So, Menon arrested him quickly and began<br />to work on the case. Before he did so, the cops interrogated many <br />and<br />for a while any group of three found walking in Vepery was treated as<br />suspects and interrogated. Keystonish? Yet true. The answer was <br />the<br />cops had no clue. None at all.<br /><br />Lakshmikantham had many enemies. Big and small. He had known that<br />his life was in danger.<br /><br />[In a chat with the writer during his research, Nargunam narrated how<br />on many nights Lakshmikantham had requested his lawyer to walk along<br />with him and put him in a rickshaw for he had the uneasy, but certain<br />feeling that some tough-looking fellows, total strangers, were<br />folowing him as he returned from Maddox street. Nargunam recalled<br />oncehe had walked along right upto Lakshmikantham's door in<br />Purasawalkam. The scandal-purveyor rarely came alone at nights to <br />his<br />lawyer's house and friend of his, a musician Gopalasami Chetty came<br />along as a walking companion! All this happened about a month before<br />November. Lakshmikantham, also requested his lawyer often during that<br />period that in anything should happen to his life. Nargunam should <br />do<br />all he could to help his aged mother and an elder brother who had <br />been<br />blind for years. Lakshmikantham was greatly attached to these two and<br />looked after them well.<br /><br />His wife never got on with her aged mother-in-law and took her to<br />court for property disputes, even during the murdered man's lifetime.<br />There were strong rumours that Lakshmikantham was never legally<br />married.]<br /><br />C. V. Arunagiri Mudaliar, then Assistant Commissioner of Police,<br />Madras was put in charge of the case by the top cop of the city, a<br />Britisher R. C. Hume. Mudaliar, Menon and the investigating team<br />realised that they had a difficult assignment to handle. Vadivelu<br />offered them hope and they came to know the police, under the law is<br />not bound to its sources of information that Vadivelu and two others<br />were seen walking together in Vepery. The 'gang of three'? The <br />other<br />two men were traced and kept in the police custody. The two men, a<br />kind of do-gooders belonging to the same depressed classes as <br />Vadivelu<br />did, were trying to help the poor press-worker in his legal tangles.<br />They were benumbed with shock and stark fear when they realised that<br />they were suspected to be involved in the murder! They were put up<br />for identification at parades and made bold to send petitions to the<br />higher-ups seeking justice. After a nerve-racking time they wre let<br />off as being innocent! But Vadivelu was kept back. And, there for a<br />while the investigation stopped. The cops could not proceed furtherÂ…<br />No clues, nothing could be found.<br /><br />Meanwhile public opinion about the delay in the police investigation<br />began to gather strength. Certain groups in the city held meetings <br />to<br />condemn the murder of a man who they considered as a moral crusader,<br />and motives were attributed for the police tardiness, and the<br />inability of the famed Madras City police to ban the real culprits.<br />The police was accused of shielding the big shots of Madras who were<br />said to be the actual culprits.<br /><br />Thus the Madras city police was under severe pressure from many<br />quarters and the heat scaled the high point when a memorandum was<br />presented to Sir Arthur Hope, by an association of government<br />employees. The Governor of Madras, in turn, turned the valve on his<br />officers and police top brass. Get the killersÂ… get onÂ… get<br />someoneÂ…come onÂ… get onÂ… onÂ…onÂ…<br /><br />And the police did! Quickly the police arrested three more men, the<br />milkman Nagalingam, boxer Arya Veera Seenan, and a butcher,<br />Rajabathar. Who were these men? According to the police, Nagalingam<br />was the other man, along with Vadivelu who attacked Lakshmikantham.<br />Frankly all of them were small fry, also-rans. According to the<br />police these were only errand boys. For whom?<br /><br />A letter gave the cops the lead, or did it? A third-rate struggling,<br />self-styled Tamil playwright and so-called screen-writer A. K.<br />Ramanna, a resident of Purasawalkam, wrote a letter to his friend in<br />whose house he was a paying guest, a film actor doing small roles, V.<br />S. Mani, then shooting at Salem. The letter, interesting and curious<br />read as follows,Â…"Yesterday morning at about 10.30, CNL while<br />returning from the house of advocate Narguman in Maddox street was<br />dastardly stabbed with a 'bichuva' in three places, and he died at 4<br />o'clock during the early hours of the dayÂ… he has been finished by a<br />personÂ… Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, _____ came to me and<br />informed me that he had done away with the life of CNL and warning me<br />not to publish this news went awayÂ…"<br /><br />This letter bore the date November 9, 1944 and reached Salem, some <br />two<br />hundred and odd miles away from Madras, only on the morning of 14th.<br />When Mani received it a police officer, K. V. Venkatsubramaniam, was<br />already seated near the actor, waiting to seize it! How? Thereby<br />hangs a tale, a curious one indeed. Very.<br /><br />Ramanna's letter posted in Purasawalkam was seen by the Censor who<br />passed on a photostat copy to the police. During the war, the <br />British<br />Indian government had a Censor authorised to intercept and open<br />letters under the guise of security. But, why was this letter<br />intercepted, opened and read? Ramanna was no terrorist, no wanted <br />man<br />gone underground, no alien. In fact he was a nobody. Why, then was<br />his letter opened? Sheet chance? Telepathy? Some other reason? Or<br />was the letter a police plant, as suggested by the defense?<br /><br />Ramanna was easily traced by the city police and taken for<br />interrogation which it would appear went on for some days during <br />which<br />period he was kept in custody. Not strictly legal, perhaps, but<br />that's how thing were in British-ruled India.<br /><br />Who was the person whose name Ramanna had left blank in his letter?<br />Arya Veera Seenan, he told the police. Seenan, Mani and he were old<br />friends and the famed boxer visited Mani often. Seenan also<br />disclosed, Ramanna said, that the 'operation Lakshmikantham murder'<br />was financed and backed by big shots of the Tamil cinema world,<br />precisly, the reigning superstar M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, <br />leading<br />comedian and star N.S. Krishnan and successful producer-director S. <br />M.<br />Sreeramulu Naidu.<br /><br />The police also had knowledge of the memorandum submitted to the<br />Governor of Madras by filmland personalities affected by the writings<br />of the murdered muckraker in "Cinema Thoothu". The top three<br />signatories were MKT Bhagavathar, NSK and SMS Naidu!<br /><br />Soon the cops picked up another young man, Jayanandan from Royapuram,<br />a sea-side area of the city. A waster, goo-for-nothing fellow, he <br />was<br />the brother of a buxom, bosomy up and coming Tamil film actress Clara<br />alias Chandra about whom Lakshmikantham had written in his weeklies.<br />He was arrested, but later he was given 'King's pardon' and taken as<br />approver. This man would play a key role in this trial and provided<br />the high drama, sensations and such.<br /><br />[There was a successful Tamil script-writer, a box-office draw in his<br />day, famous under his pen-name Ilangoven. He was a person of odd<br />tastes and hobnobbed with low-types, like rowdies, riff-raff and all.<br />He was also a good friend of Lakshmikantham's and Arya Veera<br />Seenan's. His constant companion, bodyguard, chauffer and<br />brother-in-law Sriramulu (The writer had two wives, both sisters of<br />this man's!) told the writer during the late 1970's that much of the<br />"news" in "Cinema Thoothu" and "Hindu Nesan" was based on the<br />information mostly given by Ilangovan. Even the "hush money" deals<br />were put through the good offices of this box-office-big shot film<br />writer. Ilangovan and even Sriramulu were interrogated by the city<br />police and the writer had expected to be arrested for the murder.<br />Scared he made himself scarce for a while and surfaced only when the<br />coast was clear! During his heyday Ilangovan's name in the film<br />credits meant success and most of Bhagavathar's box-office bonanzas<br />were written by him. Bhagavathar insisted that Ilangovan be fixed as<br />writer before he agreed to sign a film. However, Ilangovan spent his<br />last days in poverty, pain and obscurity.)<br /><br />And then, south India shook during December 1944, when Bhagavathar,<br />Krishnan and Sreeramulu Naidu were arrested. The arrests, specially<br />of the singing superstar, Bhagavathar was then at the peak of his<br />fame, a larger-than-life figure, a legend in his lifetime almost<br />diefied by his fans and followers, and such a person to be arrested<br />like a lowly criminal and accused of murder! To the average Tamilian<br />even the very thought was incredibleÂ…<br /><br />However, the police put of a case in court for the murder of<br />Lakshmikantham, as abetment, conspiracy and such against eight<br />accused. After the committal proceedings, before the magistrate, the<br />history-making 'Lakshmikantham Murder Case' came up for hearing in<br />April 1945, at the original Criminal Sessions of the Madras High <br />Court<br />by Mr. Justice Vere Mockett, a British Barrister who had practised in<br />Madras before his elevation to the Bench.<br /><br />VadiveluÂ… NagalingamÂ… Arya Veera SeenanÂ… M. K. Thyagaraja <br />BhagavatharÂ…<br />N. S. KrishnanÂ… S. M. Sreeramulu NaiduÂ… RajabatharÂ… ArumugamÂ… Eight<br />accused in all faced the trial. Arumugam was a cop who was alleged <br />to<br />be one of the conspirators.<br /><br />The trial attracted enormous and unprecedent attention not only in<br />India, but even beyond like Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Burma, Malaya and<br />other land's where there was a sizeable Tamil-speaking population.<br />Newspapers, in English, Tamil, Telugu and other languages published<br />'verbatim' reports of the trial, day to day. Unmanageable crowds<br />thronged the famed red-bricked Indo-Saracenic style edifice of the<br />Madras High Court, eager to take a close look at the popular and<br />glamorous faces in the dock, M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, an idol of<br />the masses and classes and N. S. Krishnan both legendary figures of<br />south India.<br /><br />P. V. Rajamannar, one of the legal luminaries of India, a long time<br />Chief Justice of Madras, then the Advocate General, led the<br />prosecution assisted by P. Govinda Menon (later, a judge of the <br />Madras<br />High Court, and Supreme Court of India). Arunagiri Mudaliar, who<br />masterminded the investigation helped the Prosecution counsel.<br /><br />A battery of lawyers, the cream of the Bar in Madras and beyond<br />appeared for the accused. Brilliant men of provenmerit, forensic<br />skills, expertise and experience, like V. T. Rangaswamy Ayyangar, V.<br />Rajagopalachari, Braddel (a Barrister from Singapore then in Madas on<br />account of the war and Japanese occupation of that city) B. T.<br />Sundararajan S. Govind Swaminathan and K.M. Munshi (A brilliant <br />Bombay<br />lawyer leading Gujerati writer, patriot-pilitician, Indian National<br />Congress leader and after India became free, central minister and<br />state governor).<br /><br />Munshi was brought from Bombay for a fabulous, unheard of fee to<br />defend Sreeramulu Naidu and his appearance made the trial a 'cause<br />celebre' all over India. He dominated the team of defense counsel,<br />and in a brilliant move he raised a plea of 'alibi' for Naidu. He<br />produced evidence based on the records of Hotel Taj, Bombay, to show<br />and prove that during the relevant dates of the conspiracy Naidu had<br />stayed at this famous and top hotel. The plea was successful and the<br />prosecution filed a "Nolle Prosequi" (no prosecution) resulting in <br />the<br />discharge of Naidu. The producer-director-studio-owner from<br />Coimbatore walked out a free man.<br /><br />Munshi was then engaged to defend N. S. Krishnan. He and other<br />counsel fought hard for the defense investing all their talents,<br />skills, legal acumen.<br /><br />The trial took an unexpected dramatic turn when the approver<br />Jayanandam entered the witness box to give evidence. Ever since, the<br />police picked him up on November 26th he had been a problem to the<br />city cops. He expressed his desire to confess before a magistrate <br />but<br />did not do so when he was taken for that purpose. Interestingly, the<br />police kept him in a prison at Saidapet, then outside the city <br />limits,<br />rather strange thing to be done. Finally he confessed on December<br />22nd and spoke about the murder which he claimed was the truth, whole<br />truth and nothing but the truth!<br /><br />His confessionÂ… Nagalingam, his old friend came to him and said that<br />arrangements had been made to do away with Lakshmikantham and it <br />would<br />be funded by Bhagavathar and N. S. Krishnan. As the scandal-weekly<br />had published obscene tales about his actress-sister and him, he had <br />a<br />grudge against its editor. So he agreed to join his friend to murder<br />Lakshmikantham. On November 7, 1944, he met Nagalingam and also<br />Vadivelu, Arya Veera Seenan, Rajabathar, Arumugam. He was also<br />introduced to one Kamalanathan, who would get the money for the<br />murder. All went to a drama theater, then very famous, called Wall<br />Tax Theater on Wall Tax Road. Here, they were met by a man with<br />prominent whiskers who took Jayanandam, Kamalanathan, Seenan and<br />Nagalingam into the 'green room' (make up room) where Bhagavathar and<br />N. S. Krishnan were present. The details of the murder were <br />discussed<br />and an advance of Rs.500 was paid. The killers also took an oath of<br />secrecy and a ritual of eating betel-leaves and salt was done by the<br />men.<br /><br />Next morning Nagalingam woke him up by 4.45 am, and both went to<br />Purasawalkam to carry out the "job" All the men assembled and moved<br />to General Collins Road where Vadivelu and Nagalingam finished the<br />"murder mission"Â… so ran Jayanandam's confession.<br /><br />And before the Judge and jury the approver went back on his <br />confession<br />and told the court on oath that his confession was a tissue of lies,<br />lies and lies, containing not even a grain of truth! He had been<br />tortured and pressurised by the police to confess and state all that<br />he did before the magistrate. Taken by shock and surprise, the<br />Advocate-General had Jayanandam treated as a hostile witness and<br />cross-examined his own 'star witness'.<br /><br />The other element of interest was the evidence of the city police<br />surgeon, a professor of the Madras Medical College, a well-known<br />person in the medical and social circles of Madras, Dr. A.<br />Sreenivasulu Naidu. He had performed the post-mortem on the body and<br />he underwent, a tough, uncomfortable and embarrassing time in the<br />witness box. He gave evidence about his post-mortem, the nature of<br />the injuries, Dr. Balakrishnan's surgical exploration, cause of death<br />and connected issues. He was grilled mercilessly during the<br />cross-examination by Munshi, Rangaswamy Ayyangar, Rajagopalachari and<br />others, experts of that fine art. The heated questioning focussed on<br />the wound caused by surgery and Dr. Naidu agreed tacitly that the<br />exploration might have caused the death. Aware of the damage of his<br />answers he tried to defend his colleague. But he made a poor<br />impression as a professional witness in spite of his credentials,<br />track record and all. When he left the box, much relieved, he also<br />left a strong impression that he had not spoken out, as a result of<br />trying to protect his young colleague Dr. Balakrishnan.<br /><br />The prosecution let in a long procession of witnesses like Gopal, A.<br />K. Ramanna, V. S. ManÂ… his actress wife JayagouriÂ… milkmen who <br />claimed<br />to be seen Jayanandam and others at the scene of crimeÂ… Margunam, Dr.<br />Mangesh RaoÂ… Dr. BalakrishnanÂ… KamalanathanÂ… and many others. A<br />perusal of the trial records does give the uneasy but distinct <br />feeling<br />that most witnesses were speaking about events they did not know much<br />about. There was loads of prevarication, by most, and the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>and<br />touch of truth seemed missing. Questions in cross-examination were<br />rarely answered directly and there was a great deal of beating about<br />the bush.<br /><br />The defense too produced witnesses and some of them went into the box<br />to support a plea of 'alibi' raised by N. S. Krishnan who claimed to<br />have been in Salem, working on a film called "Burma Rani" (1944) at<br />the Modern Theatres studio, on November 7th, the day of the Wall Tax<br />theatre-make-up room meeting.<br /><br />After a prolonged and much publicised trial, addresses to the jury by<br />counsel and the judge, the jury. And much to the surprise of many in<br />court and elsewhere, the jury returned a verdict of 'guilty' in <br />favour<br />of Arumugam. The verdict shocked Bhagavathar and NSK. Indeed the<br />famous comedian had expected to get a favourable verdict and his star<br />wife, top comedienne, T. A. Mathuram had even made arrangements for<br />distribution of sugar and sweets and a reception.<br /><br />The Judge accepted the verdict and awarded life imprisonment to all<br />the accused. Appeals were filed and heard by a Bench of the High<br />Court consisting of Sir Lionel Leach, Chief Justice, and Mr. Justice<br />K. P. Lakshmana Rao. By now P. V. Rajamannar had become a judge and<br />his successor as Advocate-General, K. Rajan Iyer appeared for the<br />Crown. Again a galaxy of lawyers appeared for the accused-<br />appellants,<br />with V. V. Srinivasa Ayyangar, and V. C. Gopalratnam joining the <br />team,<br />Munshi was not in the team. VVS was one of the leading lawyers of<br />Madras, enjoying a fabulous income. A man of culture, with a flair<br />for fine arts, and he was a High Court Judge for a brief while, and<br />resigned because the salary was not enough for him to live! VCG (his<br />son-in-law) also a successful trial lawyer was a playwright, stage<br />person and actor, prize-winning sportsman and a granary of humour and<br />wit. (The writer was his apprentice and his junior in his chambers<br />for a very brief while, during which he tried to learn unsuccessfully<br />and the secret of leading a full life with some success!).<br /><br />However, the appeals were dismissed and sentences confirmed by the<br />Appelate Bench and the accused disappeared behind the high walls of<br />jail.<br /><br />Yet Bhagavathar and Krishnan would not give up. They filed appeals <br />to<br />the Privy Council in London. D. N. Pritt, the internationally known<br />British Barrister appeared for the two movie stars. The then highest<br />court of appeal felt that the two accused did not have a fair trial<br />and remanded the case back to India for a fresh look.<br /><br />Back in Madras, the remanded appeal came up for hearing before a <br />Bench<br />of two judges. Mr. Justice Happel, and Mr. Justice Shahbuddin. V. <br />L.<br />Ethiraj, one of the most successful criminal lawyers of India, a<br />glamorous personality in a unglamorous profession, a Barrister with a<br />staggering success ration. (V. C. Gopalratnam wisecracked that V L<br />stood for 'very lucky') appeared for Bhagavathar and Krishnan.<br /><br />He built his arguments mainly on the credibility of the approver's<br />confessional evidence. Jayananam by going back on his confession and<br />also his conduct before confession had proved himself to be <br />thoroughly<br />unreliable. To base a conviction on the uncorroberated testimony of<br />an unreliable witness could be dangerous, Ethiraj argued. He also<br />stressed that the evidence of Gopal, A. K. Ramanna and others was<br />unrealiable. Ramann's letter seemed highly improbable for no sane<br />person would rush to a casual friend and speak bout a murder he had<br />committed a few hours earlier. Certainly not, a woldlywise man like<br />Arya Veera Seenan. If Ramanna were a truthful man why did he leave<br />the name of the killer blank in that letter. To put in any name<br />later? Ethiraj also argued that the judge had not properly directed<br />the jury and the evidence of doubtful value not properly assessed.<br /><br />The learned judges agreed with Ethiraj's arguments and acquitted<br />Bhagavathar and Krishnan. The judgement was delivered in 1947.  <br />Soon,<br />the other accused were also set free.<br /><br />Bhagavathar, Krishnan and the other four, Vadivelu, Nagalingam, Arya<br />Veera Seenan and Rajabathar came out after a 30 month sojourn in<br />prison.<br /><br />The Lakshmikantham Murder Case, the prolonged trial, the prison term,<br />appeals' aftermath and all crushed Bhagavathar and virtually tolled<br />his death knell. He was ruined financially, psychologically and<br />emotionally and never recovered from the shock. He made many <br />attempts<br />to rise life a phoenix, made films but failed miserably. Soon his<br />health too failed and he passed away in pain and poverty. A tragic<br />fall indeed for the mightiest Roman of the all, a sad end to a <br />success<br />story of incredible kind.<br /><br />N. S. Krishnan recovered quickly. Indeed he was his usual cheerful<br />self even during the trial, and in prison, cracking jokes and<br />performing a brilliant 'mimicry' show imitating lawyers, jury and<br />judge. Even K. M. Munshi was not spared, which that creative,<br />artistic Bombay lawyer enjoyed most, laughing uproariously! After <br />his<br />release, Krishnan's career zoomed, with his own films, some of which<br />he also directed. He dabbled in politics, and his clout, cult figure<br />status and such helped to boost his career. But somehow things were<br />not the same as the gold old days. Within a decade, he too went down<br />hill and dies in 1957. He died almost penniless.<br /><br />Vadivelu never recovered from the shock and trauma that affected his<br />mind. He died some years ago. Nagalingam committed suicide, hanging<br />himself from a ceiling fan. Rajabathar eked out a precarious living<br />selling beef in Purasawalkam market and died some years ago.<br /><br />(The writer made many attempts to meet him and make him talk but he<br />made himself scarce. He felt that the writer was trying to send him<br />to prison again!).<br /><br />Only Arya Veera Seenan lived long , old and weary and bitter about<br />life and its cruelty. He denied he had anything to do with the<br />murder.<br /><br />Jayanandam was charged with perjury and sentenced to a term in jail.<br />He too committed suicide some years ago.<br /><br />Experts and even lay-men of those times feel that the truth about the<br />murder did not come out, and Bhagavathar, N. S. Krishnan and others<br />were poor victims of the British Indian Rulers, who used these<br />ill-fated men as pawns in a game of power politics. Indeed one of <br />the<br />High Court judges who heard the remanded appeal remarked in open <br />court<br />that on the evidence even a rat could not be convicted.<br /><br />The real killers were never caught and the Truth lies buried<br />somewhere, to this day. Truth will out, they say, and one like this<br />writer wonders when! Perhaps, somedayÂ… one dayÂ…!</div>

To one of its <br />  citizens,named C. N. Lakshmikantham, a colorful character of <br />  considerable notoriety, a popular journalist of the &#39;yellow&#39; <br />variety <br />  it would be his last day on this planet. Only he was blissfully <br />  ignorant of it all. Indeed if someone had told him so that day-<br />  break he would have<br />  laughed it off, mixing it with some rich colorful two-letter Tamil <br />  words &#40;the equivalent of the English four-lettered ones!&#41; and most <br />  likely he would have slapped that bold someone! Such was the man, <br />  the<br />  earliest of yellow journalists, the prince of muck-rakers.<br />  <br />  After finishing his mundane morning chores this go-getter was on <br />his <br />  way in a man drawn rickshaw to meet his lawyer an Indian Christian <br />  who looked more like a Shakespearean actor with his wavy hair, long<br />  side-burns and all named J. Nargunam. At that time he had only a <br />  modest practice and lived on Maddox Street, Vepery, not very far <br />  from where Lakshmikantham lived in a narrow house-lined street in <br />  nearby<br />  Purasawalkam. The client and lawyer were good friends and met <br />  almost every evening after court hours.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham was quite a court-bird. And a big of a jailbird <br />too. <br />  Indeed his pre-journalist life reads like a chapter from a best <br />  selling suspense thriller. He had ambitions of becoming a lawyer,<br />  something he loved but he could not afford to go to Law College.  <br />  Yet he did not forget it and read law books. He frequented law <br />  courts of Madras city and hobnobbed with small fry lawyers, <br />  briefless, breadless<br />  ones and litigants of the illiterate kind. Clever and quick-<br />witted <br />  he soon became a law tout. Touts though prohibited by law are men <br />  who take cases and other legal matters to lawyers for a substantial<br />  &#39;kick-back&#39; in the fee. Patronised by briefless and struggling <br />  lawyers some touts in Madras with a smattering of legal knowledge <br />  earn more than most lawyers. They draft deeds and documents, <br />wills <br />  and<br />  notices mostly for illiterates and some touts resort to forgery <br />and <br />  fabricating documents very casually of course, for a stiff fee.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham was one such tout and smart enough to argue his own <br />  cases in court. One of his shady deals involving the fabrication <br />of <br />  a sworn affidavit created by him in a case filed against him by a<br />  leading Madras daily found him in the dock in the Madras High <br />Court <br />  Original Sessions. During the hearing he escaped hoodwinking a <br />  posse of cops and for a while he lived a happy-go-lucky life, <br />until <br />  the cops<br />  nabbed and brought him to trial. Found guilty he received a 7 <br />year <br />  jail sentence and was ordered to be imprisoned at Rajamundry, then <br />  in Madras presidency and now in Andhra Pradesh. While the train <br />  taking<br />  him was crossing a river in Andhra he, hand-chained, managed to <br />  escape fooling the guarding cops and jumped from the chug-chugging <br />  train into the river below shrouded by darkness. With chains and <br />  all he swam<br />  across the big river and disappeared into the dark night. He <br />roamed <br />  around freely for a long while until an angry girl friend tipped <br />off <br />  the searching Madras city cops. Back in custody he was declared <br />  a &#39;dangerous convict&#39; and deported to the Andamans. With an ocean <br />  surrounding this famed island prison, Lakshmikantham could not <br />even <br />  dream of escape. He served his term until as a war security <br />measure <br />  he along with others was set fee and shipped back home.<br />  <br />  Back in Madras, a notorious ex-convict, he avoided courts and cops <br />  for whom he had an understandable allergy! Life had to go on and <br />he <br />  dabbled in many things. He ran a small restaurant serving meat <br />  dishes<br />  which in south India were then known as "military hotels" <br />{Eateries <br />  serving only vegetarian food were called &#39;civil&#39; hotels}. He lost <br />  in this venture and looked around for greener pastures. Soon he <br />  found<br />  one, Journalism. A profession that would bring him money, fame or <br />  more precisely notoriety, and a violent end.<br />  <br />  Around 1943 he launched a film weekly in Tamil "Cinema Thoothu".  <br />It <br />  was a different kind of magazine. Lakshmikantham did not publish <br />  articles about theories and trends in cinema and such. He filled <br />the<br />  pages with tales of bedroom activities, amours and amatory <br />  adventures of prominent filmland figures like reigning superstar <br />M. <br />  K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, brilliant comedian hailed as <br />the &#39;Charlie <br />  Chaplin of<br />  India&#39;, N. S. Krishnan and his star wife T. A. Mathuram, <br />successful <br />  producer S. M. Sreeramulu Naidu and many others enjoying stardom <br />and <br />  immense popularity in south India. He ran "series" about <br />  Bhagavathar and Krishnan as a weekly feature. He wielded a facile <br />  pen and his writing was lively, punchy and enjoyable to read. <br />  Bhagavathar, a singing star was then at his zenith of his career <br />and <br />  fame. More a singer than an actor his following was incredible.  <br />  Masses, classes, intellectuals, upper crust folks, all loved him, <br />  his music. Women<br />  adored him and many society dames threw themselves at him. Such <br />was <br />  his charisma. At this time he was one of the most famous figures <br />of <br />  south India, a household name.<br />  <br />  <br />  No wonder, "Cinema Thoothu", the first of its kind was a raving <br />sell-<br />  out and copies sold at a premium. The Tamil-speaking world had <br />  never seen anything like this weekly. The south Indian society, <br />some<br />  forty and odd years ago was conservative, old-fashioned and <br />subjects <br />  like sex were strictly taboo and barely whispered. In such rigid, <br />  regimented atmosphere not surprisingly people loved gossip and <br />  scandal<br />  and hungered to read and know all about the goings-on behind <br />closed <br />  doors in high places. Movie glamour had already seeped into the <br />  skin and soul of society and this wily pen-totter took a hundred-<br />and-<br />  ten<br />  per cent advantage of it all.<br />  <br />  What was Lakshmikantham&#39;s aim in running such a magazine? He <br />  professed, at least in public to be a traditionalist with a <br />  missionary zeal to uphold the ideals and high values of ancient <br />  Indian culture.<br />  He claimed he was socially conscious reformer come to earth, to <br />  clean the stables free of sinners and seducers, adulterers and the <br />  likes. But his real aim, the sole purpose was blackmail, pure and <br />  simple.<br />  And surely it paid him ample dividends. Many actors, actresses <br />and <br />  cinema men paid him hush money to buy his silence.<br />  <br />  Some like Bhagavathar complained to the authorities and a <br />memorandum <br />  signed by the superstar and other victims of the blackmailer&#39;s <br />  vitriolic pen was submitted to Sir Arthur Hope the then Governor of<br />  Madras. At once he acted and the license for publication was <br />  cancelled. However Lakshmikantham was not unduly worried. He <br />  instructed his lawyer Nargunam to file an appeal to Delhi. When <br />  Delhi<br />  did not bother about "Cinema Thoothu" the resourceful fellow <br />  utilising past expertise forged and fabricated an order renewing <br />his <br />  license! With this fake document he managed to run his paying <br />  magazine for some<br />  weeks. When the situation turned hot he gave up "Cinema <br />Thoothu".  <br />  He searched around and soon found a tottering weekly named "Hindu <br />  Nesan". Its objective and theme were to uphold Hindu culture, <br />  tradition,<br />  values and such. It suited Lakshmikantham and he took it over.<br />  <br />  "Hindu Nesan" clicked at once and its new editor expanded his <br />target <br />  list of victims. Besides movie people he wrote salacious <br />scandalous <br />  stories about business magnates, prosperous lawyers and doctors,<br />  popular musicians, feudal landlords and landed gentry, press <br />barons <br />  and idle rich, religious heads and even small fry if there was a <br />  chance to bleed them. Every scandal tinted with sex was grist to <br />his<br />  mill and that spelt money.<br />  <br />  &#39;Hush money&#39; poured in and soon Lakshmikantham acquired property, <br />  like houses, land and gold and a printing press. Soon he was <br />  elevated to the status of cult figure in Madras. Most of the <br />stuff <br />  he wrote was<br />  partly true and his writing acquired a sheen of credibility adding <br />  to his popularity. He was smart enough to know that every <br />cupboard <br />  had its skeletons and he searched for them!<br />  <br />  Victims, like Bhagavathar tried to buy his silence but <br />  Lakshmikantham was too smart to yield to such tactics. Some <br />again, <br />  like Bhagavathar hired hooligans to beat him up, but he the bigger <br />  hooligan of them all<br />  proved too tough, and he beat them up! One such hired goonda was <br />a <br />  rowdy, a milkman by profession who had supplied milk to the <br />  Lakshmikantham family. His name was Nagalingam.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham knew he had enemies of many a kind, big and small.  <br />  So for a short while he hired a bodyguard to protect him. That <br />man <br />  was a well- known weightlifter, boxer who ran a gymnasium for <br />  sometime. He was a staunch Hindu and had played a role in Hindu-<br />  Muslim riots. He also played roles in movies as stuntman. His <br />name <br />  was Sreenivasulu Naidu, better known as Arya Veera Seenan!<br />  <br />  "Hindu Nesan" not only became a best-selling weekly but also a <br />much-<br />  talked about one. Of course, in most homes the crudely produced <br />  weekly printed on cheap paper, the entire contents of which were<br />  written by the wily editor himself was read on the sly, in privacy <br />  like toilets and bedrooms. But almost every adult talked about <br />the <br />  stories in the weekly, their authenticity and all that. Though <br />very<br />  few had seen the muck-peddler, he was almost a household name at <br />  least for a brief period.<br />  <br />  And then Lakshmikantham announced that a new sensational story <br />would <br />  be featured from a particular date in his weekly. A no-holds-<br />barred <br />  expose one a sensational but unsolved killing known as &#39;The Boat <br />Mail<br />  Murder&#39;. &#39;The Boat Mail&#39; was a fast running train from Madras to <br />  Dhanushkodi, serving as a link for ships from India to Sri Lanka. <br />  Hence, the name. In that train, a rich banker, a moneybag, <br />  Lakshmanan<br />  Chettiar, was brutally murdered as the mail steamed its way to <br />  Madras tearing through the dark night. Who killed the wealthy <br />man? <br />  To this day, half a century later, it remains a mystery, <br />unsolved.  <br />  The murder<br />  rocked the province and many bigwigs were said to be behind it. <br />The <br />  killing, a bloody one, allegedly took place in the presence of an <br />  eye-witness, a popular singer-actress, but somehow the truth never<br />  surfaced nor was it permitted, the public felt. Lakshmikantham <br />wrote <br />  that he would reveal the names of the killers in the very first <br />  issue.<br />  <br />  That issue of "Hindu Nesan" never came out! Before it could <br />  Lakshmikantham went out of this wide, wicked world and his exit <br />was <br />  set in motion that day, November 8, 1944!<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham had a tenant living in one of his houses. He was a <br />  hired help in type-composing in one of the top English dailies of <br />  Madras and his widowed sister-in-law kept house for him.<br />  Lakshmikantham took a dislike to his tenant, maybe because the man <br />  came from a lowly depressed community. Anyway he wanted him to <br />  vacate his house but the press-worker refused. Enraged the house-<br />  owner<br />  published titillating tit-bits in &#39;Hindu Nesan&#39; about the tenant <br />and <br />  his buxom sister-in-law who the editor suggested in his racy Tamil <br />  took good care of the man of many more things not merely the house!<br />  Consequently the two men fought in streets, exchanging blows with <br />  the scandal-sheet scribe getting knifed in the process. He also <br />  filed a case of trespass and succeeding in it he tried to take <br />  possession of<br />  his house, throwing and breaking things like mirrors, chairs and <br />  pots in the process.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham filed a criminal complaint against his tenant for <br />  assault but the cops did not take notice of it. So he briefed his <br />  lawyer to file a private complaint against that damned low-born<br />  fellow. His name was Vadivelu.<br />  <br />  That fateful morning Lakshmikantham carried legal papers connected <br />  with this case and Nargunam and he discussed the matter, seated in <br />  the upstairs office-room of his bungalow. Then the lawyer took <br />  leave of<br />  his friend asking him to meet him later in court and he went in to <br />  get ready to go to court. Lakshmikantham walked out towards his <br />  rickshaw. The "puller" was missing for a while and then he got <br />into <br />  the<br />  man-drawn-vehicle, destination home, sweet home.<br />  <br />  Maddox street winds along a narrow, lonely deserted curve and ends <br />  in General Collins Road, a quiet street of garden houses and <br />  spacious bungalows only on one side. The other side was vacant <br />  land, and<br />  playgrounds. In 1944 there was not much of traffic in that part <br />of <br />  Vepery. Madras City, itself was then only a small city of some <br />half <br />  a million people as against five million and more of today.<br />  <br />  While the rickshaw moved down that curve with no houses around, <br />  suddenly some men, - how many nobody was sure Â– appeared and <br />zeroed <br />  in on the vehicle, toppling it. One of them pulled out a knife and<br />  stabbed Lakshmikantham and as suddenly as they appeared they<br />  disappeared running in different directions.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham bleeding and groaning in severe pain got up and <br />with <br />  his hands pressed to the wounded area, he walked back to his <br />  lawyer&#39;s house. By now, Nargunam who had heard about the stabbing <br />  from some<br />  passers-by had come out of the house. The two met on the street <br />  when Lakshmikantham told him about the attack. What did he say?  <br />  According to the lawyer&#39;s evidence in court, the Tamil word his <br />  client used was<br />  "Avan" &#40;which means "he"&#41;. Whom did he refer to by "he"?<br />  <br />  {Years later in the early 1970s when the writer was researching on <br />  this case, Nargunam told him emphatically that the word <br />  Lakshmikantham used was "Evano!" which means "someone"! "Avan" <br />  and "Evan" are<br />  phonetically similar and that&#39;s how the confusion arose he <br />  explained. When asked why he did not tell the court, what he told <br />  the writer, Nargunam merely shrugged it all off!}<br />  <br />  Anyway, Nargunam put Lakshmikantham in another rickshaw and asked <br />  him to go to the General Hospital, the biggest at that time, a <br />mile <br />  away. He also requested a client of his, Mr. Brew, an Anglo-<br />Indian, <br />  who<br />  happened to pass by, to go along with the injured man. Brew <br />  followed in another rickshaw and now Lakshmikantham bleeding and <br />  bound for the General Hospital instructed his rickshaw-man to take <br />  him to the Vepery police station situated nearby.<br />  <br />  Sub-inspector Krishnan Nambiyar came out, on being informed by <br />Brew <br />  and met the bleeding man seated in the vehicle. Now, Brew left <br />and <br />  went about his work. What exactly took place at the station was <br />  never<br />  clear for the police version was questioned later in court during <br />  the sensational trial and a study of the trial papers does not <br />  convey the impression that the truth did not come out. Or it was <br />not <br />  permitted to<br />  as many believed then and continue to do so to this day.<br />  <br />  According to Nambiyar, Lakshmikantham complained speaking in <br />English <br />  about the stabbing attack on him and while he spoke Nambiyar took <br />it <br />  all down on a piece of white paper. This was something unusual <br />even<br />  odd, for under the police procedure and law, such complaints <br />should <br />  be written in a book maintained for that purpose and not on bits <br />of <br />  paper. But the cop had an explanation. As the man was too injured <br />to<br />  have left the vehicle he took down what he narrated on a sheet of <br />  paper under the circumstances. Nambiyar had to stand, one foot on <br />  the rickshaw, paper and pad resting on his thigh, and write which <br />  would<br />  have been impossible if he had to bring that bulky book and write <br />it <br />  all down in triplicate using carbon sheets!<br />  <br />  After he wrote it all down, Lakshmikantham read it and signed it <br />at <br />  the bottom, or did he? If so, when and where? Indeed this <br />  important document became an issue later during the trial. And, <br />not <br />  without<br />  reason!<br />  <br />  In that complaint, the name Vadivelu and &#39;another man&#39;, aged 30, <br />  were mentioned as the assailants. Lakshmikantham, however never <br />  identified, nor named his attackers at any time before he died the <br />  morning after. Indeed when he was treated at the out-patient ward <br />of <br />  the General Hospital by Dr. A. K. Joseph, he stated that he had no <br />  idea of who his attacker was. In the register maintained by the <br />  hospital the relevant<br />  entry read "Name of assailant Â– Not known".<br />  <br />  Again, later, when Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan, the house surgeon who <br />  treated Lakshmikantham as an in-patient talked to him the &#39;yellow&#39; <br />  journalist stated he did not know who the assailant was. If so, <br />how<br />  did the name Vadivelu appear in that sheet?<br />  <br />  In Nagalingam, the rowdyish milkman who was later arrested and <br />  charged as the second assailant was really the person, why did <br />  Lakshmikantham mention about a person aged 30. Nagalingam had <br />been <br />  his milkman and<br />  known him for years. If so, why did not he name Nagalingam as the <br />  second culprit? Was Nagalingam not there that morning? Vadivelu? <br />  Was he there, or not?<br />  <br />  To confuse matters there were corrections and over-writings and <br />  such, even inks of different colours in what Nambiyar wrote!<br />  <br />  {C.Ramanna, a Madras City lawyer, with a modest practice whom <br />  Vadivelu had consulted about his house tenancy problem told the <br />  writer years later a startling story which he swore was as true <br />  as &#39;the sun-rise<br />  every dawn&#39;. When Lakshmikantham was stabbed that ill-fated <br />morning <br />  alleged to be by Vadivelu, the poor press-worker was seated in a <br />  chair in his office! So, the lawyer argued it was impossible that <br />  my client<br />  Vadivelu stabbed that fellow. Why did he not tell the police <br />about <br />  this steel-strong alibi? The lawyer had a shocking tale to tellÂ….<br />  <br />  He did speak to the city top cops but they shut their ears, eyes <br />and <br />  all senses. When he persisted they threatened to rope him in, <br />  arrest and charge him as accused. How? The cops had a theory.<br />  Lakshmikantham wrote about a newspaper baron and his affair with a <br />  leading singer-actress and that VIP and this lawyer were related. <br />  Besides, Vadivelu worked in that big shot&#39;s press! So, the cops<br />  hinted the baron had asked his lawyer relative to rub off <br />  Lakshmikantham and he in turn fixed up his client Vadivelu and <br />heÂ…! <br />  The shocked lawyer raced back home and went about his other<br />  business!}.<br />  <br />  And that was not all. There were more matters creating and <br />casting <br />  long and strong shadows of doubts in the police and prosecution <br />  version of the case.<br />  <br />  For example, the weapon, a knife, or dagger as it was described. <br />  According to the rickshawman, Gopal, he picked up the blood-<br />stained <br />  knife and the legal papers Lakshmikantham had with him, equally<br />  stained and took them to Nargunam. Strangely, the lawyer took the <br />  papers and told Gopal to hand over the knife at the Vepery police <br />  station. Why did he keep back the papers which were also important<br />  evidence, like the knife? Nargunam could not offer any valid <br />  explanation either during the trial in the witness-box or years <br />  later to the writer.<br />  <br />  An important point he did clarify to the writer was his conduct <br />  after he saw his client with the bleeding stab injuries. <br />  Lakshmikantham had been his friend and client, and a frequent <br />  visitor to his house. Why,<br />  then did he not take him to the nearest doctor at once, or having <br />  failed to do so, why did he not accompany his friend and client to <br />  the General Hospital instead of sending Brew, ho came along that <br />way <br />  by<br />  sheer accident? He was cross-examined during the trial by defense <br />  lawyers but his answer was far from convincing. Years later he <br />gave <br />  the writer a convincing explanation. He found that the injuries <br />were<br />  simple and certainly not so serious to warrant his personal and <br />  immediate attention. Moreover, he was anxious to avoid getting <br />  involved with sordid attacks on a shady character which he knew his<br />  client certainly was!<br />  <br />  His evaluation of the injuries as simple tallied with that of S. <br />I. <br />  Nambiyar&#39;s. And, also that of the victim himself. The police <br />  officer had noted in the case register the nature of the injuries <br />as <br />  simple,<br />  and he registered a case only for &#39;simple hurt&#39; under the Indian <br />  Penal Code.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham too should have felt the same way explaining why he <br />  chose to visit the police station first without rushing to the <br />  Hospital as urged by his lawyer.<br />  <br />  Dr. Joseph too had the same opinion when he treated the injured <br />man <br />  at the out-patient ward.<br />  <br />  Another issue of confusion, - and doubt -, was the knife.  <br />According <br />  to the police case, Gopal handed over the weapon to Nambiyar.  <br />Under <br />  the rules the receipt of the knife should have been entered in a<br />  property register, immediately by the station clerk. But no such <br />  entry about this knife was found noted in that book! Why not? <br />  Nambiyar offered vague replies under cross-examination and <br />ventured <br />  to<br />  suggest that such procedure was not always followed! A perusal of <br />  the Vepery police station register revealed that even <br />insignificant <br />  items, like onions, eggs and such were recorded, but this blood-<br />  stained knife<br />  was not. Why not? Was there no such knife at all? Were Gopal and <br />  Nambiyar spinning yarns? Was the knife a fake, not the real one, <br />  but something introduced later by the cops?<br />  <br />  What of Gopal? Was he really an eye-witness to the attack, as he <br />  claimed to be. The defense case was that he had run away, scared <br />to <br />  death as soon as his rickshaw was toppled. There is strong force <br />  behind this theory. After Lakshmikantham was stabbed he a man <br />with <br />  knife injuries bleeding and shocked came walking groaning and <br />  moaning towards his lawyer&#39;s house. Why did he not come in that <br />  rickshaw.<br />  Was it because that Gopal was not around to help the victim, <br />having <br />  run away to safety? Indeed Gopal came with his vehicle towards <br />the <br />  place on the street where the lawyer and the victim stood only <br />  minutes<br />  later. All these suggest strongly that Gopal was no eye-witness <br />as <br />  put by the police and his evidence not based on truth.<br />  <br />  However, Lakshmikantham accompanied by a cop sent by Nambiyar <br />  reached the General Hospital where Dr. Joseph attended on him and <br />  also spoke about the attack based on which he made those entries <br />in <br />  the<br />  &#39;casualty&#39; register. Interestingly the prosecution did not choose <br />  to call Dr. Joseph to give evidence at the trial in spite of the <br />  pressure by the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Vere Mockett &#40;later <br />Sir <br />  Vere<br />  Mockett&#41;. Somewhat exasperated the honorable High Court Judge <br />  summoned this young doctor to as a court witness to tender <br />evidence. <br />  Why did the prosecution fight shy? The explanation was <br />unconvincing.<br />  <br />  At the GH Lakshmikantham was beginning to feel uneasy and the <br />  bleeding from the injury in the abdomen did not cease. So he was <br />  admitted as an in-patient for further treatment in the Wenlock <br />ward <br />  under a<br />  well-known surgeon of the day, Dr. Nadkarni Mangesh Rao, one of <br />the <br />  senior Indian doctors of Madras.<br />  <br />  Around this period Nargunam visited the hospital twice. He <br />deposed <br />  in court that the first time he found that his friend had not <br />  reached the hospital and on the second visit, Lakshmikantham was <br />in <br />  poor condition<br />  and taking a turn for the worse.<br />  <br />  {However, some quarter-century later the lawyer told the writer a<br />  different tale which he declared was the undiluted truth. When he<br />  went to the GH, he did meet Lakshmikantham whom he found in bed but<br />  hale and hearty. He cracked obscene jokes in Tamil about <br />those "sons<br />  of whores" who dared to attack him. He would get out of GH in a <br />day<br />  or two and would teach all those bastards a fitting lesson and show<br />  who Lakshmikantham really was! Nargunam laughed enjoying his <br />  friend&#39;s<br />  two-lettered Tamil abuses and left promising to visit him next <br />  morning<br />  on his way to court. His shock when he heard about <br />Lakshmikantham&#39;s<br />  death knew no bounds for he never expected it. "I never even <br />dreamt<br />  he would die!" he remarked his voice dropping to a heavy whisper.}<br />  <br />  Whatever happened to Lakshmikantham at the GH? Something that <br />ended<br />  his eventful, exciting life. Something, now very clear, discussed<br />  hotly then, both in and out of courts and even today almost half a<br />  century later.<br />  <br />  When the bleeding did not stop Dr. Mangesh Rao wondered if the <br />  patient<br />  had suffered any serious internal injury like damage to the<br />  peritoneum. He felt an exploration of the abdominal wound was<br />  necessary. So he instructed his assistant Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan <br />to<br />  do the needful as he was busy otherwise engaged in serious cases!  <br />  But<br />  the problem Dr. Balakrishnan found that the blood pressure of the<br />  patient had dropped very low and promptly he informed his senior of<br />  the condition. Dr. Rao felt that an exploration of the wound under<br />  such low blood pressure would prove fatal and told his assistant<br />  against it and suggested some treatment to stop the bleeding.<br />  <br />  Yet, Dr. Balakrishnan did perform an exploration on Lakshmikantham.<br />  Why did he do it? No answer was ever found and Dr. Balakrishnan<br />  carried the truth to his grave. He did offer an explanation but it<br />  satisfied none. Anyway his surgical exploration created another<br />  wound, the second one. This two-wound situation figured <br />prominently<br />  at the trial casting doubts on the prosecution case. Indeed the<br />  defense openly suggested that the cause of the death was the<br />  exploration and not the stab wound.<br />  <br />  An examination of the patient&#39;s urine revealed blood, indicating<br />  damage to the kidney. There was no clear proof about the <br />condition <br />  of<br />  the urine before Lakshmikantham was wheeled into the operation<br />  theater. What had caused the damage? The surgical exploration?<br />  <br />  Interestingly and perhaps, sadly, no defense lawyer categorically<br />  asked questions whether the blade of the knife could have reached <br />the<br />  kidney and cut it into two! All the counsel were very eminent <br />  lawyers<br />  of standing, skills and experience but nobody pursued that line.  <br />One<br />  wonders why?<br />  <br />  The news about the attack on Lakshmikantham hit the city like a <br />storm<br />  and crowds in large numbers gathered inside the hospital grounds,<br />  corridors and almost everywhere and police had a tough time<br />  maintaining order. It became the talk of the town, and wild <br />stories<br />  began to circulate about the identity of the assailant or <br />assailants,<br />  nobody was sure, not even the cops at this juncture Â– and the <br />people<br />  behind it.<br />  <br />  As night fell, Lakshmikantham took a turn for the worse. He became<br />  delirious and in the early hours of the following morn, at about <br />  4.15,<br />  November 9, 1944, he died, due to secondary shock caused by damage <br />to<br />  the kidney. It was all over. A life of stir and sensation,<br />  excitement and escapes had ended. An ex-con who had been a thorn <br />in<br />  many a flesh, had been eliminated. A case of simple hurt had <br />ended <br />  in<br />  murder. A hornet&#39;s nest had been stirred.<br />  <br />  Who did it? Nobody really knows.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham had been elevated to the status of a martyr. His <br />  death<br />  rocked south India, and his funeral became an event. His body was<br />  laid on a bench in the front area of his house in Purasawalkam for<br />  public view, and thousands of men, women and even kids thronged to <br />  pay<br />  homage to him. Floral wreaths were laid at his feet, and many <br />women<br />  who had never known or seen him wept beating their breasts wailing<br />  loudly. Mass hysteria reigned during the funeral. A poor man, an<br />  ordinary man, who took cudgels to cleanse society had been <br />eliminated<br />  by the sinful haves, the sadistic rich, the bigwigs. That was the<br />  feeling that filled the air, as thousands followed the funeral<br />  procession. That day, C. N. Lakshmikantham, dead and cold, was the<br />  most talked-about person in Madras. A raging world war, a voilent<br />  freedom struggle, shortage of essential commodities, all were<br />  forgotten by people.<br />  <br />  Police Inspector Keshava Menon took over the investigation of the<br />  murder at once. Frankly he had no clue of any kind. Stories<br />  circulated in the Maddox street Â– General Collins Road area of a <br />  group<br />  of three persons, or four was seen running around the time of <br />attack.<br />  And the hunt for that &#39;gang of three&#39; began in right earnest!<br />  <br />  The police had known about the enemity between the murdered man, <br />and<br />  the press-worker, Vadivelu. So, Menon arrested him quickly and <br />began<br />  to work on the case. Before he did so, the cops interrogated many <br />  and<br />  for a while any group of three found walking in Vepery was treated <br />as<br />  suspects and interrogated. Keystonish? Yet true. The answer was <br />  the<br />  cops had no clue. None at all.<br />  <br />  Lakshmikantham had many enemies. Big and small. He had known that<br />  his life was in danger.<br />  <br />  [In a chat with the writer during his research, Nargunam narrated <br />how<br />  on many nights Lakshmikantham had requested his lawyer to walk <br />along<br />  with him and put him in a rickshaw for he had the uneasy, but <br />certain<br />  feeling that some tough-looking fellows, total strangers, were<br />  folowing him as he returned from Maddox street. Nargunam recalled<br />  oncehe had walked along right upto Lakshmikantham&#39;s door in<br />  Purasawalkam. The scandal-purveyor rarely came alone at nights to <br />  his<br />  lawyer&#39;s house and friend of his, a musician Gopalasami Chetty came<br />  along as a walking companion! All this happened about a month <br />before<br />  November. Lakshmikantham, also requested his lawyer often during <br />that<br />  period that in anything should happen to his life. Nargunam <br />should <br />  do<br />  all he could to help his aged mother and an elder brother who had <br />  been<br />  blind for years. Lakshmikantham was greatly attached to these two <br />and<br />  looked after them well.<br />  <br />  His wife never got on with her aged mother-in-law and took her to<br />  court for property disputes, even during the murdered man&#39;s <br />lifetime.<br />  There were strong rumours that Lakshmikantham was never legally<br />  married.]<br />  <br />  C. V. Arunagiri Mudaliar, then Assistant Commissioner of Police,<br />  Madras was put in charge of the case by the top cop of the city, a<br />  Britisher R. C. Hume. Mudaliar, Menon and the investigating team<br />  realised that they had a difficult assignment to handle. Vadivelu<br />  offered them hope and they came to know the police, under the law <br />is<br />  not bound to its sources of information that Vadivelu and two <br />others<br />  were seen walking together in Vepery. The &#39;gang of three&#39;? The <br />  other<br />  two men were traced and kept in the police custody. The two men, a<br />  kind of do-gooders belonging to the same depressed classes as <br />  Vadivelu<br />  did, were trying to help the poor press-worker in his legal <br />tangles.<br />  They were benumbed with shock and stark fear when they realised <br />that<br />  they were suspected to be involved in the murder! They were put up<br />  for identification at parades and made bold to send petitions to <br />the<br />  higher-ups seeking justice. After a nerve-racking time they wre <br />let<br />  off as being innocent! But Vadivelu was kept back. And, there <br />for a<br />  while the investigation stopped. The cops could not proceed <br />furtherÂ…<br />  No clues, nothing could be found.<br />  <br />  Meanwhile public opinion about the delay in the police <br />investigation<br />  began to gather strength. Certain groups in the city held <br />meetings <br />  to<br />  condemn the murder of a man who they considered as a moral <br />crusader,<br />  and motives were attributed for the police tardiness, and the<br />  inability of the famed Madras City police to ban the real culprits.<br />  The police was accused of shielding the big shots of Madras who <br />were<br />  said to be the actual culprits.<br />  <br />  Thus the Madras city police was under severe pressure from many<br />  quarters and the heat scaled the high point when a memorandum was<br />  presented to Sir Arthur Hope, by an association of government<br />  employees. The Governor of Madras, in turn, turned the valve on <br />his<br />  officers and police top brass. Get the killersÂ… get onÂ… get<br />  someoneÂ…come onÂ… get onÂ… onÂ…onÂ…<br />  <br />  And the police did! Quickly the police arrested three more men, <br />the<br />  milkman Nagalingam, boxer Arya Veera Seenan, and a butcher,<br />  Rajabathar. Who were these men? According to the police, <br />Nagalingam<br />  was the other man, along with Vadivelu who attacked Lakshmikantham.<br />  Frankly all of them were small fry, also-rans. According to the<br />  police these were only errand boys. For whom?<br />  <br />  A letter gave the cops the lead, or did it? A third-rate <br />struggling,<br />  self-styled Tamil playwright and so-called screen-writer A. K.<br />  Ramanna, a resident of Purasawalkam, wrote a letter to his friend <br />in<br />  whose house he was a paying guest, a film actor doing small roles, <br />V.<br />  S. Mani, then shooting at Salem. The letter, interesting and <br />curious<br />  read as follows,Â…"Yesterday morning at about 10.30, CNL while<br />  returning from the house of advocate Narguman in Maddox street was<br />  dastardly stabbed with a &#39;bichuva&#39; in three places, and he died at <br />4<br />  o&#39;clock during the early hours of the dayÂ… he has been finished by <br />a<br />  personÂ… Yesterday morning at 11 o&#39;clock, _____ came to me and<br />  informed me that he had done away with the life of CNL and warning <br />me<br />  not to publish this news went awayÂ…"<br />  <br />  This letter bore the date November 9, 1944 and reached Salem, some <br />  two<br />  hundred and odd miles away from Madras, only on the morning of <br />14th.<br />  When Mani received it a police officer, K. V. Venkatsubramaniam, <br />was<br />  already seated near the actor, waiting to seize it! How? Thereby<br />  hangs a tale, a curious one indeed. Very.<br />  <br />  Ramanna&#39;s letter posted in Purasawalkam was seen by the Censor who<br />  passed on a photostat copy to the police. During the war, the <br />  British<br />  Indian government had a Censor authorised to intercept and open<br />  letters under the guise of security. But, why was this letter<br />  intercepted, opened and read? Ramanna was no terrorist, no wanted <br />  man<br />  gone underground, no alien. In fact he was a nobody. Why, then <br />was<br />  his letter opened? Sheet chance? Telepathy? Some other reason?  <br />Or<br />  was the letter a police plant, as suggested by the defense?<br />  <br />  Ramanna was easily traced by the city police and taken for<br />  interrogation which it would appear went on for some days during <br />  which<br />  period he was kept in custody. Not strictly legal, perhaps, but<br />  that&#39;s how thing were in British-ruled India.<br />  <br />  Who was the person whose name Ramanna had left blank in his letter?<br />  Arya Veera Seenan, he told the police. Seenan, Mani and he were <br />old<br />  friends and the famed boxer visited Mani often. Seenan also<br />  disclosed, Ramanna said, that the &#39;operation Lakshmikantham murder&#39;<br />  was financed and backed by big shots of the Tamil cinema world,<br />  precisly, the reigning superstar M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, <br />  leading<br />  comedian and star N.S. Krishnan and successful producer-director <br />S. <br />  M.<br />  Sreeramulu Naidu.<br />  <br />  The police also had knowledge of the memorandum submitted to the<br />  Governor of Madras by filmland personalities affected by the <br />writings<br />  of the murdered muckraker in "Cinema Thoothu". The top three<br />  signatories were MKT Bhagavathar, NSK and SMS Naidu!<br />  <br />  Soon the cops picked up another young man, Jayanandan from <br />Royapuram,<br />  a sea-side area of the city. A waster, goo-for-nothing fellow, he <br />  was<br />  the brother of a buxom, bosomy up and coming Tamil film actress <br />Clara<br />  alias Chandra about whom Lakshmikantham had written in his <br />weeklies.<br />  He was arrested, but later he was given &#39;King&#39;s pardon&#39; and taken <br />as<br />  approver. This man would play a key role in this trial and <br />provided<br />  the high drama, sensations and such.<br />  <br />  [There was a successful Tamil script-writer, a box-office draw in <br />his<br />  day, famous under his pen-name Ilangoven. He was a person of odd<br />  tastes and hobnobbed with low-types, like rowdies, riff-raff and <br />all.<br />  He was also a good friend of Lakshmikantham&#39;s and Arya Veera<br />  Seenan&#39;s. His constant companion, bodyguard, chauffer and<br />  brother-in-law Sriramulu &#40;The writer had two wives, both sisters of<br />  this man&#39;s!&#41; told the writer during the late 1970&#39;s that much of <br />the<br />  "news" in "Cinema Thoothu" and "Hindu Nesan" was based on the<br />  information mostly given by Ilangovan. Even the "hush money" deals<br />  were put through the good offices of this box-office-big shot film<br />  writer. Ilangovan and even Sriramulu were interrogated by the city<br />  police and the writer had expected to be arrested for the murder.<br />  Scared he made himself scarce for a while and surfaced only when <br />the<br />  coast was clear! During his heyday Ilangovan&#39;s name in the film<br />  credits meant success and most of Bhagavathar&#39;s box-office bonanzas<br />  were written by him. Bhagavathar insisted that Ilangovan be fixed <br />as<br />  writer before he agreed to sign a film. However, Ilangovan spent <br />his<br />  last days in poverty, pain and obscurity.&#41;<br />  <br />  And then, south India shook during December 1944, when Bhagavathar,<br />  Krishnan and Sreeramulu Naidu were arrested. The arrests, <br />specially<br />  of the singing superstar, Bhagavathar was then at the peak of his<br />  fame, a larger-than-life figure, a legend in his lifetime almost<br />  diefied by his fans and followers, and such a person to be arrested<br />  like a lowly criminal and accused of murder! To the average <br />Tamilian<br />  even the very thought was incredibleÂ…<br />  <br />  However, the police put of a case in court for the murder of<br />  Lakshmikantham, as abetment, conspiracy and such against eight<br />  accused. After the committal proceedings, before the magistrate, <br />the<br />  history-making &#39;Lakshmikantham Murder Case&#39; came up for hearing in<br />  April 1945, at the original Criminal Sessions of the Madras High <br />  Court<br />  by Mr. Justice Vere Mockett, a British Barrister who had practised <br />in<br />  Madras before his elevation to the Bench.<br />  <br />  VadiveluÂ… NagalingamÂ… Arya Veera SeenanÂ… M. K. Thyagaraja <br />  BhagavatharÂ…<br />  N. S. KrishnanÂ… S. M. Sreeramulu NaiduÂ… RajabatharÂ… ArumugamÂ… Eight<br />  accused in all faced the trial. Arumugam was a cop who was <br />alleged <br />  to<br />  be one of the conspirators.<br />  <br />  The trial attracted enormous and unprecedent attention not only in<br />  India, but even beyond like Ceylon &#40;Sri Lanka&#41;, Burma, Malaya and<br />  other land&#39;s where there was a sizeable Tamil-speaking population.<br />  Newspapers, in English, Tamil, Telugu and other languages published<br />  &#39;verbatim&#39; reports of the trial, day to day. Unmanageable crowds<br />  thronged the famed red-bricked Indo-Saracenic style edifice of the<br />  Madras High Court, eager to take a close look at the popular and<br />  glamorous faces in the dock, M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, an idol <br />of<br />  the masses and classes and N. S. Krishnan both legendary figures of<br />  south India.<br />  <br />  P. V. Rajamannar, one of the legal luminaries of India, a long time<br />  Chief Justice of Madras, then the Advocate General, led the<br />  prosecution assisted by P. Govinda Menon &#40;later, a judge of the <br />  Madras<br />  High Court, and Supreme Court of India&#41;. Arunagiri Mudaliar, who<br />  masterminded the investigation helped the Prosecution counsel.<br />  <br />  A battery of lawyers, the cream of the Bar in Madras and beyond<br />  appeared for the accused. Brilliant men of provenmerit, forensic<br />  skills, expertise and experience, like V. T. Rangaswamy Ayyangar, <br />V.<br />  Rajagopalachari, Braddel &#40;a Barrister from Singapore then in Madas <br />on<br />  account of the war and Japanese occupation of that city&#41; B. T.<br />  Sundararajan S. Govind Swaminathan and K.M. Munshi &#40;A brilliant <br />  Bombay<br />  lawyer leading Gujerati writer, patriot-pilitician, Indian National<br />  Congress leader and after India became free, central minister and<br />  state governor&#41;.<br />  <br />  Munshi was brought from Bombay for a fabulous, unheard of fee to<br />  defend Sreeramulu Naidu and his appearance made the trial a &#39;cause<br />  celebre&#39; all over India. He dominated the team of defense counsel,<br />  and in a brilliant move he raised a plea of &#39;alibi&#39; for Naidu. He<br />  produced evidence based on the records of Hotel Taj, Bombay, to <br />show<br />  and prove that during the relevant dates of the conspiracy Naidu <br />had<br />  stayed at this famous and top hotel. The plea was successful and <br />the<br />  prosecution filed a "Nolle Prosequi" &#40;no prosecution&#41; resulting in <br />  the<br />  discharge of Naidu. The producer-director-studio-owner from<br />  Coimbatore walked out a free man.<br />  <br />  Munshi was then engaged to defend N. S. Krishnan. He and other<br />  counsel fought hard for the defense investing all their talents,<br />  skills, legal acumen.<br />  <br />  The trial took an unexpected dramatic turn when the approver<br />  Jayanandam entered the witness box to give evidence. Ever since, <br />the<br />  police picked him up on November 26th he had been a problem to the<br />  city cops. He expressed his desire to confess before a magistrate <br />  but<br />  did not do so when he was taken for that purpose. Interestingly, <br />the<br />  police kept him in a prison at Saidapet, then outside the city <br />  limits,<br />  rather strange thing to be done. Finally he confessed on December<br />  22nd and spoke about the murder which he claimed was the truth, <br />whole<br />  truth and nothing but the truth!<br />  <br />  His confessionÂ… Nagalingam, his old friend came to him and said <br />that<br />  arrangements had been made to do away with Lakshmikantham and it <br />  would<br />  be funded by Bhagavathar and N. S. Krishnan. As the scandal-weekly<br />  had published obscene tales about his actress-sister and him, he <br />had <br />  a<br />  grudge against its editor. So he agreed to join his friend to <br />murder<br />  Lakshmikantham. On November 7, 1944, he met Nagalingam and also<br />  Vadivelu, Arya Veera Seenan, Rajabathar, Arumugam. He was also<br />  introduced to one Kamalanathan, who would get the money for the<br />  murder. All went to a drama theater, then very famous, called Wall<br />  Tax Theater on Wall Tax Road. Here, they were met by a man with<br />  prominent whiskers who took Jayanandam, Kamalanathan, Seenan and<br />  Nagalingam into the &#39;green room&#39; &#40;make up room&#41; where Bhagavathar <br />and<br />  N. S. Krishnan were present. The details of the murder were <br />  discussed<br />  and an advance of Rs.500 was paid. The killers also took an oath <br />of<br />  secrecy and a ritual of eating betel-leaves and salt was done by <br />the<br />  men.<br />  <br />  Next morning Nagalingam woke him up by 4.45 am, and both went to<br />  Purasawalkam to carry out the "job" All the men assembled and <br />moved<br />  to General Collins Road where Vadivelu and Nagalingam finished the<br />  "murder mission"Â… so ran Jayanandam&#39;s confession.<br />  <br />  And before the Judge and jury the approver went back on his <br />  confession<br />  and told the court on oath that his confession was a tissue of <br />lies,<br />  lies and lies, containing not even a grain of truth! He had been<br />  tortured and pressurised by the police to confess and state all <br />that<br />  he did before the magistrate. Taken by shock and surprise, the<br />  Advocate-General had Jayanandam treated as a hostile witness and<br />  cross-examined his own &#39;star witness&#39;.<br />  <br />  The other element of interest was the evidence of the city police<br />  surgeon, a professor of the Madras Medical College, a well-known<br />  person in the medical and social circles of Madras, Dr. A.<br />  Sreenivasulu Naidu. He had performed the post-mortem on the body <br />and<br />  he underwent, a tough, uncomfortable and embarrassing time in the<br />  witness box. He gave evidence about his post-mortem, the nature of<br />  the injuries, Dr. Balakrishnan&#39;s surgical exploration, cause of <br />death<br />  and connected issues. He was grilled mercilessly during the<br />  cross-examination by Munshi, Rangaswamy Ayyangar, Rajagopalachari <br />and<br />  others, experts of that fine art. The heated questioning focussed <br />on<br />  the wound caused by surgery and Dr. Naidu agreed tacitly that the<br />  exploration might have caused the death. Aware of the damage of <br />his<br />  answers he tried to defend his colleague. But he made a poor<br />  impression as a professional witness in spite of his credentials,<br />  track record and all. When he left the box, much relieved, he also<br />  left a strong impression that he had not spoken out, as a result of<br />  trying to protect his young colleague Dr. Balakrishnan.<br />  <br />  The prosecution let in a long procession of witnesses like Gopal, <br />A.<br />  K. Ramanna, V. S. ManÂ… his actress wife JayagouriÂ… milkmen who <br />  claimed<br />  to be seen Jayanandam and others at the scene of crimeÂ… Margunam, <br />Dr.<br />  Mangesh RaoÂ… Dr. BalakrishnanÂ… KamalanathanÂ… and many others. A<br />  perusal of the trial records does give the uneasy but distinct <br />  feeling<br />  that most witnesses were speaking about events they did not know <br />much<br />  about. There was loads of prevarication, by most, and the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>and<br />  touch of truth seemed missing. Questions in cross-examination were<br />  rarely answered directly and there was a great deal of beating <br />about<br />  the bush.<br />  <br />  The defense too produced witnesses and some of them went into the <br />box<br />  to support a plea of &#39;alibi&#39; raised by N. S. Krishnan who claimed <br />to<br />  have been in Salem, working on a film called "Burma Rani" &#40;1944&#41; at<br />  the Modern Theatres studio, on November 7th, the day of the Wall <br />Tax<br />  theatre-make-up room meeting.<br />  <br />  After a prolonged and much publicised trial, addresses to the jury <br />by<br />  counsel and the judge, the jury. And much to the surprise of many <br />in<br />  court and elsewhere, the jury returned a verdict of &#39;guilty&#39; in <br />  favour<br />  of Arumugam. The verdict shocked Bhagavathar and NSK. Indeed the<br />  famous comedian had expected to get a favourable verdict and his <br />star<br />  wife, top comedienne, T. A. Mathuram had even made arrangements for<br />  distribution of sugar and sweets and a reception.<br />  <br />  The Judge accepted the verdict and awarded life imprisonment to all<br />  the accused. Appeals were filed and heard by a Bench of the High<br />  Court consisting of Sir Lionel Leach, Chief Justice, and Mr. <br />Justice<br />  K. P. Lakshmana Rao. By now P. V. Rajamannar had become a judge <br />and<br />  his successor as Advocate-General, K. Rajan Iyer appeared for the<br />  Crown. Again a galaxy of lawyers appeared for the accused-<br />  appellants,<br />  with V. V. Srinivasa Ayyangar, and V. C. Gopalratnam joining the <br />  team,<br />  Munshi was not in the team. VVS was one of the leading lawyers of<br />  Madras, enjoying a fabulous income. A man of culture, with a flair<br />  for fine arts, and he was a High Court Judge for a brief while, and<br />  resigned because the salary was not enough for him to live! VCG <br />&#40;his<br />  son-in-law&#41; also a successful trial lawyer was a playwright, stage<br />  person and actor, prize-winning sportsman and a granary of humour <br />and<br />  wit. &#40;The writer was his apprentice and his junior in his chambers<br />  for a very brief while, during which he tried to learn <br />unsuccessfully<br />  and the secret of leading a full life with some success!&#41;.<br />  <br />  However, the appeals were dismissed and sentences confirmed by the<br />  Appelate Bench and the accused disappeared behind the high walls of<br />  jail.<br />  <br />  Yet Bhagavathar and Krishnan would not give up. They filed <br />appeals <br />  to<br />  the Privy Council in London. D. N. Pritt, the internationally <br />known<br />  British Barrister appeared for the two movie stars. The then <br />highest<br />  court of appeal felt that the two accused did not have a fair trial<br />  and remanded the case back to India for a fresh look.<br />  <br />  Back in Madras, the remanded appeal came up for hearing before a <br />  Bench<br />  of two judges. Mr. Justice Happel, and Mr. Justice Shahbuddin.  <br />V. <br />  L.<br />  Ethiraj, one of the most successful criminal lawyers of India, a<br />  glamorous personality in a unglamorous profession, a Barrister <br />with a<br />  staggering success ration. &#40;V. C. Gopalratnam wisecracked that V L<br />  stood for &#39;very lucky&#39;&#41; appeared for Bhagavathar and Krishnan.<br />  <br />  He built his arguments mainly on the credibility of the approver&#39;s<br />  confessional evidence. Jayananam by going back on his confession <br />and<br />  also his conduct before confession had proved himself to be <br />  thoroughly<br />  unreliable. To base a conviction on the uncorroberated testimony <br />of<br />  an unreliable witness could be dangerous, Ethiraj argued. He also<br />  stressed that the evidence of Gopal, A. K. Ramanna and others was<br />  unrealiable. Ramann&#39;s letter seemed highly improbable for no sane<br />  person would rush to a casual friend and speak bout a murder he had<br />  committed a few hours earlier. Certainly not, a woldlywise man <br />like<br />  Arya Veera Seenan. If Ramanna were a truthful man why did he leave<br />  the name of the killer blank in that letter. To put in any name<br />  later? Ethiraj also argued that the judge had not properly <br />directed<br />  the jury and the evidence of doubtful value not properly assessed.<br />  <br />  The learned judges agreed with Ethiraj&#39;s arguments and acquitted<br />  Bhagavathar and Krishnan. The judgement was delivered in 1947.  <br />  Soon,<br />  the other accused were also set free.<br />  <br />  Bhagavathar, Krishnan and the other four, Vadivelu, Nagalingam, <br />Arya<br />  Veera Seenan and Rajabathar came out after a 30 month sojourn in<br />  prison.<br />  <br />  The Lakshmikantham Murder Case, the prolonged trial, the prison <br />term,<br />  appeals&#39; aftermath and all crushed Bhagavathar and virtually tolled<br />  his death knell. He was ruined financially, psychologically and<br />  emotionally and never recovered from the shock. He made many <br />  attempts<br />  to rise life a phoenix, made films but failed miserably. Soon his<br />  health too failed and he passed away in pain and poverty. A tragic<br />  fall indeed for the mightiest Roman of the all, a sad end to a <br />  success<br />  story of incredible kind.<br />  <br />  N. S. Krishnan recovered quickly. Indeed he was his usual cheerful<br />  self even during the trial, and in prison, cracking jokes and<br />  performing a brilliant &#39;mimicry&#39; show imitating lawyers, jury and<br />  judge. Even K. M. Munshi was not spared, which that creative,<br />  artistic Bombay lawyer enjoyed most, laughing uproariously! After <br />  his<br />  release, Krishnan&#39;s career zoomed, with his own films, some of <br />which<br />  he also directed. He dabbled in politics, and his clout, cult <br />figure<br />  status and such helped to boost his career. But somehow things <br />were<br />  not the same as the gold old days. Within a decade, he too went <br />down<br />  hill and dies in 1957. He died almost penniless.<br />  <br />  Vadivelu never recovered from the shock and trauma that affected <br />his<br />  mind. He died some years ago. Nagalingam committed suicide, <br />hanging<br />  himself from a ceiling fan. Rajabathar eked out a precarious living<br />  selling beef in Purasawalkam market and died some years ago.<br />  <br />  &#40;The writer made many attempts to meet him and make him talk but he<br />  made himself scarce. He felt that the writer was trying to send <br />him<br />  to prison again!&#41;.<br />  <br />  Only Arya Veera Seenan lived long , old and weary and bitter <br />about<br />  life and its cruelty. He denied he had anything to do with the<br />  murder.<br />  <br />  Jayanandam was charged with perjury and sentenced to a term in <br />jail.<br />  He too committed suicide some years ago.<br />  <br />  Experts and even lay-men of those times feel that the truth about <br />the<br />  murder did not come out, and Bhagavathar, N. S. Krishnan and others<br />  were poor victims of the British Indian Rulers, who used these<br />  ill-fated men as pawns in a game of power politics. Indeed one of <br />  the<br />  High Court judges who heard the remanded appeal remarked in open <br />  court<br />  that on the evidence even a rat could not be convicted.<br />  <br />  The real killers were never caught and the Truth lies buried<br />  somewhere, to this day. Truth will out, they say, and one like <br />this<br />  writer wonders when! Perhaps, somedayÂ… one dayÂ…!</div></blockquote></div>
