			<div class="content">Malathi, Udanx,<br /><br />Good debate...Everyone has their talent and we should respect<br />everyone. My order of preference for music always goes from b/w movies<br />to IR and then only to the latest movies. Whatever said and done, IR<br />is IR and we should accept that. And I felt some of Malathi's words<br />are harsh towards IR...<br /><br />I remember IR himself saying that, he delivers only a portion of what<br />he thinks in his mind, because by the time he gets a music in his<br />mind, and recollect and write it as notes in the paper, he misses most<br />of the them. Because music is a continuous flow and very difficult to<br />keep pace of the minds speed. So if only a portion of his creativity<br />has shaken us, what will be the full force of his thought process??<br /><br />Recently in one concert, SPB narrated their experience of a song<br />recording in Bombay. The orchestra was local and IR, SPB and team were<br />there to record a song. After the recording is done, one of the local<br />orchestra talked with SPB and scolded IR with bad words...dont ask<br />that person to come again, he is giving very difficult notes to play<br />and better you too dont come back, because you are ruining our income<br />by finishing the song in one take....<br /><br />As Udanx said, no one can match the mood that IR can create. As I<br />said, IR music can be visualized. When I heard a song from Pithamagan<br />before the movie was released, I was thinking that it should be a<br />climax song and could feel what the song situation could be and the<br />same I could see when the movie was released.<br /><br />And on Hey Ram, Kamal said, the music is history, never happened and<br />will never happen - L.Subramaniam was the music director, composed the<br />songs for Hey Ram and almost 80% of the song shooting was completed.<br />Then due to some reason, L.Subramaniam moved out and due to personal<br />friendship Kamal requested IR to take over. All the filming done for<br />the movie was a loss as they have to shoot the songs again with IRs<br />music. IR coming to know of this, said, dont throw it away, show me<br />the picturisation of the songs without the music, I will compose the<br />new songs, with the same lyrics for the lip movement of what has been<br />shot already.... and thats how it was done...I dont think anyone will<br />have that guts to do such a thing and the music of HeyRam are pretty<br />decent...<br /><br />Talking of ARR - I was a die hard fan of Rahman once. Though he is a<br />great music director, I have my reservations, when he reuses the same<br />music again and again...Tamil songs remade into Hindi, then again into<br />english...also read a review on his album,'Vande Mataram' - if this is<br />his dream project, why cant he create a new piece and why is he<br />reusing the song from Karuthamma?' very valid point....<br /><br />And ARR's songs used in hollywood movies - The movie 'Inside Man' has<br />'Chayya Chayya' full song as its title song,with due credits to ARR.<br />It was pleasure to see a Hindi song played as title song in a<br />hollywood movie and that too the music director is a Tamil....what<br />else to say..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Udanx - we are beginning to talk a little in circles nenakkaren..Excuse my usage of the word 'some'. IR knows classical music very well. Podhuma? Point taken. My point - he is not theÂ ONLY one who knew classical music very well. I think I told you creativity/fusion etcÂ was his forte - granted. But creativity/fusion is not the only way you rank a music director. I cannot talk as fluently as you do in cricket lingo. Let us use something more basic. Perhaps food?<br />Â <br />There are two ice cream shops famous near where I live. One is a regular one, sells good home made ice cream in standard flavors. Vanilla, Strawberry,Chocolate, Pistachio, some others. Wholesome regular flavor. If you have visited Gujarat, the home of dairy in India you would have some idea. The ice cream there tastes so different from other branded products. This shop islike that. The other shop is a creative freak. Totally mix and match all types of flavors. Mango Pineapple with Avocados and pecan toppings, LavenderPeppermint with pistachios, Chocolate bananas with red chillieÂ sprinkle toppingsÂ (or something like that). Some of these flavors are great, some are well..somewhat questionable. I like red chilies, bananas and chocolate,but not in the same bowl. So do so many other people. Yes the regular flavors get very boring at times but lots of people like just a regular bowl ofice cream nothing fancy. Can we compete on which ice cream is best?<br />One guy gets awards for wholesomeness, the other guy for creativity. That is all. Old timers get awards for wholesome regular classical music, there are no debates on which raga is used, it is direct, simple and easy. IR gets award for creativity and usage of rare ragas. If I don't like chillie chocolate ice cream I don't like people messing around with Mari Mari ninne, it is good as it is . You might like it and also go for Kanakangi while I settle for a regular Kambodhi. Since when did classical music become an experiment in exoticism? <br />Â <br />On variety just some statistics. G Ramanathan had 54 songs in Sivakavi, each one a different raaga. Ghantasala had 29 in Lavakusa, again each one a different raga (many were cut in the movie to sustain the limit and interest of the tamil audience). MSV made songs with many interesting creative variances - Enge nimmadhi to date used the maximum instruments as orchestra, Ponal pogattum poda, the least. So everybody has their share of 'medals'? Sariya...<br />Â <br />This debate gives an interesting opportunity to compile the stuff I alreadyknow and learn more. I will send more details tonight. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br />Â <br /><br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/12/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, September 12, 2008, 9:57 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malathi,<br />Â <br />I am Sorry madam.I just quoted what you said in the previous mail.

I am sure they willsay "Poo Malaye Thol Serava" / Udaya Geetham Songs / Or if you insist on even earlier songs they may come to Jonny. But let me tell you when you lookat his career from Annakili to Moodupani (His 100th movie) he has tried / experimented many ragas during this period. I will say post 85 were all hitall his experiments were 76 - 85.<br />Â <br />Coming to the Tier-1 / Tier-2 concept I do agree that MSV / KVM are all there in Tier-1.

But why didn't it strike MSV and KVM to do the experiments which IR did? Applying the same concept again and again is a ordinary thing.

All others greats of previous generations are good teachers, not a scientist. But this man is a good scientist. So I give this extra credit to this man and I place him up on the top. Above all the greats of yester years.<br />Â <br />Remember Kamal once said about IR, you should not call him "Isai Gnani" rather you should call him "Isai Vignani" Now you may question Kamal's knowledge in music. Kamal once broke his leg and was out of film shooting for sometime. He utilised that to start his music classes and his teacher was Dr.Balamuralikrishn a.<br />Â <br />Again coming back to Ragas handled by other greats show me one in Kanakangi- First Ragam in Melakarta.

			<div class="content">Udanx, also I forgot that whole Subbudu/Kamal thing. Subbudu was an ocean of knowledge in classical music. Kamal knows a lot about movies. But both are master bloopers. Subbudu was asked towards his later years on who was hisfavorite movie director. Take a wild guess whom he said?? IR makes songs like pazhaiya kaalam, ARR does not make music at all - my preference is Deva. Deva the copycat king, in my opinion he does not even rank on the list ofmusic directors worthy of discussion!! Subbudu continued his Deva puranam for a while actually, kumudam i think. Maybe another magazine also but I remember how he stunned the whole music world when he said that.<br />Â <br />Kamal, I think I have bashed Kamal enough so not trying any further. Rendu perume Vasishtar illai - yaarukkum Brahmarishi kuddukka.

IR knows classical music very well. Podhuma? Point taken. My point - he is not theÂ ONLY one who knew classical music very well. I think I told you creativity/fusion etcÂ was his forte - granted. But creativity/fusion is not the only way you rank a music director. I cannot talk as fluently as you do in cricket lingo. Let us use something more basic. Perhaps food?<br />Â <br />There are two ice cream shops famous near where I live. One is a regular one, sells good home made ice cream in standard flavors. Vanilla, Strawberry,Chocolate, Pistachio, some others. Wholesome regular flavor. If you have visited Gujarat, the home of dairy in India you would have some idea. The ice cream there tastes so different from other branded products. This shop islike that. The other shop is a creative freak. Totally mix and match all types of flavors. Mango Pineapple with Avocados and pecan toppings, LavenderPeppermint with pistachios, Chocolate bananas with red chillieÂ sprinkle toppingsÂ (or something like that). Some of these flavors are great, some are well..somewhat questionable. I like red chilies, bananas and chocolate,but not in the same bowl. So do so many other people. Yes the regular flavors get very boring at times but lots of people like just a regular bowl ofice cream nothing fancy. Can we compete on which ice cream is best?<br />One guy gets awards for wholesomeness, the other guy for creativity. That is all. Old timers get awards for wholesome regular classical music, there are no debates on which raga is used, it is direct, simple and easy. IR gets award for creativity and usage of rare ragas. If I don't like chillie chocolate ice cream I don't like people messing around with Mari Mari ninne, it is good as it is . You might like it and also go for Kanakangi while I settle for a regular Kambodhi. Since when did classical music become an experiment in exoticism? <br />Â <br />On variety just some statistics. G Ramanathan had 54 songs in Sivakavi, each one a different raaga. Ghantasala had 29 in Lavakusa, again each one a different raga (many were cut in the movie to sustain the limit and interest of the tamil audience). MSV made songs with many interesting creative variances - Enge nimmadhi to date used the maximum instruments as orchestra, Ponal pogattum poda, the least. So everybody has their share of 'medals'? Sariya...<br />Â <br />This debate gives an interesting opportunity to compile the stuff I alreadyknow and learn more. I will send more details tonight. <br />Â <br />Malathi<br />Â <br /><br /><br />--- On Fri, 9/12/08, Udanx  wrote: <br /><br />From: Udanx <br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Cometh the moment cometh the man<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, September 12, 2008, 9:57 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Malathi,<br />Â <br />I am Sorry madam.I just quoted what you said in the previous mail.

			<div class="content">This is a nice discussion. But i dont think ARR is getting his due<br />especially for what he has achieved in such a short time. He's in the<br />industry for less than 20 years? Even IR had to reinvent his techniques (not<br />music which was and is divine) after Roja. Tamil music, tamil cinema owe a<br />lot to ARR simply for making an effort to globalise. Regarding him redoing<br />his own tunes, come on, its his own tune...he's not taking IR's or MSV's<br />tune!! If he feels Karuthamma song would have suited Vande Matharam then he<br />can do it, its not IR's tune, is it? And Vande Mataram was a stunning album<br />which made the phrase Vande Mataram comfortable to a whole new generation.<br /><br />And the guy is inredibly shy during interviews. There was this interview in<br />NDTV and the host was really agitated as ARR was only giving answers in<br />"mmmm" and all the while looking down. This was sometime after Roja and then<br />after some years they had another one which was only slightly better.<br /><br />IR, MSV are all incredible south Indian music directors. ARR is of another<br />level. A true product of globalisation.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul</div>
