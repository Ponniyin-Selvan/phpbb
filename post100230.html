			<div class="content">The Nayagan posts unexpectedly sparkled some intense discussions<br /><br />Just thought I'll point out that Manirathnam and Kamal are 2 of my favorite Indian film makers and I eagerly look forward to each of their movies. Both have grown in stature tremendously since Nayagan. I suppose Kamal was already huge in every way at the time of Nayagan. Kamal's Hey Ram is one of my favorite films and Virumandi is a film I really like for the way it was scripted and directed. I even like the box office flop Mumbai Express very much<br /><br />However, I would never compare Nayagan and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is an epic in every way where as Nayagan is just another movie although a lot better than most made during its time.<br /><br />Think of it this way-if for instance, Tamil films were to be screened for international merit, I would surely choose movies like Thevar Magan, Virumandi, Autograph, Thavamai Thavamirundhu and such like (movies with more originality and character) than a movie inspired by a very popular other language film. It would hurt me if some one immediately pointed out that this made from that movie.<br /><br />My displeasure is more in thinking that an actor of Kamal's caliber could have brought out his own mannerism into that character (specially if was written around the Mumbai Don) instead of trying to imitate Brando.<br /><br />On a lighter note, I dont mind it if they get inspired from English films or songs but I really hate it when anything Hindi is copied into Tamil. I think I will never like G.V Prakash for copying that song (or getting inspired ) from the old Hindi song.<br /><br />Best regards<br />Sandeep<br /><br />Rahul dhinakaran  wrote: hi;<br />talking about inspirations and copycats..there have been numerous discussions in this group about our dear dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> being "inspired" by Dumas' Three Musketeers. the first scene, the letter being carried by the hero, his sweetheart being of royal blood, an incredibly beautiful but equally dangerous lady villain, the hero gets smitten by the the same, in both <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> (Karikalan's murder) and 3M (Fleur De Lis) the lady villain has an horrible past, in both these cases Nandini and Milady are affected by a main character in the story etc,etc,etc..

			<div class="content">Ah, talking of Kuruthipunal, that is again a remake (not inspired) of the hindi film Drokal. But in this case, I feel Kuruthipunal is a better film than the Hindi version with stronger characters, acting and better technical aspects. Kamal has essayed that role very well. The others have performed superbly as well. They have their own distinctive portrayals more than the original film.<br /><br />Its unfortunate that Kamal could not make a movie out of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. He could have played Vandiyathevan well some 20 years back. Hey thats going back to the time Nayagan was released eh!<br /><br />Best regards<br />Sandeep<br /><br /><br /><br />Vijayababu Boopathy  wrote: <br /><br />precious feeling  wrote: <br /><br />My displeasure is more in thinking that an actor of Kamal's caliber could have brought out his own mannerism into that character (specially if was written around the Mumbai Don) instead of trying to imitate Brando.<br /><br />Correctly said,<br /><br />He would have done like he has done in<br />"Vazvey mayam, Pesum padam,KuruthiPunal, Avvai Sanmugi, Sippikul Muthu(he only acted in its Telugu version)".

I suppose its all practicing the craft!<br /><br />Speaking of Nayagan and Godfather reminded me of the original - the portrayal by Al Paccino and Marlon Brando are exceptional. They are so vivid in my mind even after so many years. When i watched Nayagan in the theater when it was released, I was really bored and couldnt believe that people didnt know that it was more or less a straight lift of the English film.<br /><br />For those who havent seen this movie - Scent of a woman - another exceptional performance by Al Pacino.<br /><br />Best regards<br />Sandeep<br /><br /><br />SatishKumar Arunachalam  wrote: Ah..these are quite common.<br />Manirathinam, who is considered to be one of the best directors in<br />Industry got inspired (this is the word used for 'copy' in India) only<br />by Hollywood movies.

			<div class="content">Haris Jeyaraj is another music director who can copy huge portions of another song. I was shocked when I heard a song on FM while waiting at a railway reservation. This was an old Hindi song most likely from the 60's and the tune was exactly the same as "oru malai" - Gajini.
