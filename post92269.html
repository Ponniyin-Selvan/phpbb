			<div class="content">Santh,<br /><br />For the most part, I am on the same side of the fence as you are here<br />but there are a couple of places where I think you succumb to some<br />generalization. Couldn't resist bringing that up.<br /><br />First of all, this is an open forum. Whether the moderator has the<br />time to read every mail before posting is besides the point. I, for<br />one, do not think that the moderator(whoever he is) should monitor<br />posts before publishing them. The idea of free speech/expression is<br />something that this 'open' forum guarantees all of us and I agree<br />with you abt observing etiquettes but reading/curbing posts is<br />definitely not my idea of enforcing it. In ACLU terms, I'd call it a<br />First Amendment Violation <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I also think you are generalizing when you say that you see this<br />trend is groups mostly involving Indians. As someone who belongs to<br />quite a few Indian / S Asian / world literature / culture groups, my<br />experience has not been quite the same. There are 'over-enthusiastic'<br />people in every group and then there are some who provide well-<br />thought of analyses, regardless of whatever culture they belong to.<br /><br />Even if we assume for a moment that you are right abt this, how can<br />you attribute it to an overdose of convent education and a lack of<br />academic training? When did convent education had anything to do with<br />whether a person can think logically or not? (Other than the obvious<br />religious part of it ofcourse!)<br /><br />Again, my intention is not to start another argument here. As I said,<br />I am completely with you in the need for observing etiquette and/or<br />providing cogent analyses but couldn't help thinking that you are<br />generalizing a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> too much.<br /><br />Veena<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Santhana GopalaKrishnan"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Note: I always correct typos after I publish...<br /> <br />  Introspection?

And there<br />  has to be no pleading or negotiating in observing ground rules.<br /> <br />  I have seen this trend repeatedly in groups involving Indians. They<br />  carry more passion than substance, and even the few articles that<br />hint<br />  substance is seldom supported by cogent evidence or analysis. Our<br />  enthusiasm is disproportionately large compared to the hard work we<br />  put in to seek truth. I can blame this to an overdose of convent<br />  education, too much time at the PCs without the interest to do the<br />  research, lack of proper academic training as we continue to be bad<br />  amateurs and a tendency to succumb to idealogues.<br /> <br />  One other ominous trend is you will always see a dude trying to take<br />  every discussion on any topic to hindu persecution and hindutva<br />  renaissance. He will always be angry with Alauddin Khilji for<br />  desecrating Madurai temple and will not forgive him in a million<br />  years.

But I am<br />          human....<br />         <br />          Dear Ms.Fact Finder Veena,<br />         <br />          The things I told about RSS were published in the<br />          issues of Tuqlaq in<br />          early January, with photos, interviews with NGOs,<br />          Victims and even<br />          govt. officers who dont want them to be named etc.<br />          If you say Cho<br />          publishes nonsense in Tuqlaq, the whole group,<br />          rather the whole world<br />          will laugh at you.<br />         <br />          Likewise I can counter all your points with facts,<br />          but that will not<br />          solve the purpose, becuase its easy to wake up a<br />          sleeping person, but<br />          impossible to wake up a person acting as if asleep.<br />         <br />          Being in the US&#40;I assume so&#41; you might be a genius,<br />          but I&#40;rather all&#41;<br />          too have an iota of commonsense and a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of<br />          knowledge. I think you<br />          belong to the category&#40;like the politicians&#41; who<br />          think that if we<br />          talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />          become truth.<br />         <br />          Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />          proved that so and<br />          so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />          because you would not<br />          belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />          sorry for being<br />          harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />          his/her mother,<br />          when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />          me. Likewise<br />          Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />          questioning is like<br />          questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />          again for being<br />          harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />          into the loop<br />          again.<br />         <br />          I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />          indeed. Sampath,<br />          myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />          and valid points.<br />          Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />          force you too.<br />          But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />          facts to<br />          substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />          about things they<br />          believed.<br />         <br />          All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />          and I asking for<br />          the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />          the facts from you<br />          for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />          gave me the<br />          facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />          the list of<br />          mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />          preaching which I<br />          expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />          practicing is difficult.<br />         <br />          When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />          produce, I too have the<br />          right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />          come up with the<br />          facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />          and off.<br />         <br />          Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />          Jharkand<br />          Governor and condemn me alone.<br />         <br />          I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />          FULL STOP. BUT I<br />          WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />          FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />          AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />          1500 TEMPLES IN 20<br />          YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />          DEFINITELY STRAY.<br />         <br />          If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />          for destruction<br />          which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />          Vivekananda&#39;s<br />          topics on Karma Yoga.<br />         <br />          Regards,<br />          Satish<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        __________________________________<br />        Do you Yahoo!?<br />        Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Sri,<br /><br />I didnt check my mails for the past few days and did only now. Was<br />really shocked. I think the very next statement in my mail was an<br />open apology, not once but twice.

As in this<br />case, this nature of mine has earned me only wrong name right from my<br />shcool days, but i never regreted that. Incidently, I am reading<br />vivekandas karma yoga and I fell very happy to read that its a humans<br />duty to fight against the adharma. So I never leave a chance to fight<br />when something goes wrong.

I think you<br />    belong to the category&#40;like the politicians&#41; who<br />    think that if we<br />    talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />    become truth.<br />   <br />    Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />    proved that so and<br />    so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />    because you would not<br />    belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />    sorry for being<br />    harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />    his/her mother,<br />    when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />    me. Likewise<br />    Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />    questioning is like<br />    questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />    again for being<br />    harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />    into the loop<br />    again.<br />   <br />    I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />    indeed. Sampath,<br />    myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />    and valid points.<br />    Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />    force you too.<br />    But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />    facts to<br />    substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />    about things they<br />    believed.<br />   <br />    All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />    and I asking for<br />    the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />    the facts from you<br />    for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />    gave me the<br />    facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />    the list of<br />    mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />    preaching which I<br />    expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />    practicing is difficult.<br />   <br />    When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />    produce, I too have the<br />    right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />    come up with the<br />    facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />    and off.<br />   <br />    Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />    Jharkand<br />    Governor and condemn me alone.<br />   <br />    I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />    FULL STOP. BUT I<br />    WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />    FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />    AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />    1500 TEMPLES IN 20<br />    YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />    DEFINITELY STRAY.<br />   <br />    If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />    for destruction<br />    which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />    Vivekananda&#39;s<br />    topics on Karma Yoga.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  __________________________________<br />  Do you Yahoo!?<br />  Yahoo!

Preaching is easy,<br />    practicing is difficult.<br />   <br />    When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />    produce, I too have the<br />    right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />    come up with the<br />    facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />    and off.<br />   <br />    Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />    Jharkand<br />    Governor and condemn me alone.<br />   <br />    I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />    FULL STOP. BUT I<br />    WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />    FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />    AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />    1500 TEMPLES IN 20<br />    YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />    DEFINITELY STRAY.<br />   <br />    If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />    for destruction<br />    which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />    Vivekananda&#39;s<br />    topics on Karma Yoga.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  __________________________________<br />  Do you Yahoo!?<br />  Yahoo!
