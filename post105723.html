			<div class="content">Sivakami adorns the Singapore stage  <br />- Nirmala Chari  <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.narthaki.com/info/rev08/rev566.html">http://www.narthaki.com/info/rev08/rev566.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />April 10, 2008 <br /><br />Mamallapuram, the ancient coastal city on the Bay of Bengal, is<br />remembered today as the Pallava kings' gift to Tamilnadu. Mamallapuram<br />was the dream of the visionary ruler Mahendra Pallavan who reigned in<br />the 6th / 7th century AD. He was a ruler who was loved by his people<br />and who worked tirelessly to maintain peace for his people for<br />twenty-five years Â– when suddenly war loomed at his gates! King<br />Pulikesi of the neighboring Chalukya Empire, was almost at the<br />Pallava kingdom's door step with an menacing army of 16,000 elephants,<br />12,000 cavalry and over a lakh of foot soliders. News came as the<br />army had reached Tungabadra River! Facing certain defeat, King<br />Mahendra Pallava performed a magnificent feat of camouflage, secrecy<br />and political outmaneuvering to prolong peace for ten years, only to<br />lose his life in battle trying to save his beloved capital city Kanchi<br />Â– the Pallava capital. <br /><br />This is the historical background that fuelled the brilliant mind of<br />Kalki Krishnamurthy for his memorable story SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM. One<br />of the most luminary writers of the 20th century, Kalki, as he was<br />called with affection and awe, wove spellbinding narratives creating<br />fictional characters located in actual historical times. 'Ponniyin<br />Selvan' and 'Parthiban Kanavu' are memorable for the richness of their<br />full blooded heroes and heroines located directly within actual<br />historical events of South India. The stories, serialized in the<br />immensely popular Tamil magazine Kalki, captured the imagination of an<br />entire generation of readers who would wait avidly for the next issue<br />of the magazine so that they could participate in the highs and lows<br />of the wonderfully etched characters. A runaway hit for 12 years was<br />his story of the dancing heroine of Kanchi, SIVAKMIYIN SAPATAM. The<br />human life drama woven into the story was so believable and intense<br />that millions were gripped with SIVAKAMI fever throughout these years,<br />many actually learning to read and enjoy the Tamil language through<br />the colourful saga of kings, war and power struggles.  <br />  <br />	<br />Across the Indian Ocean in nearby Singapore, the tale of Sivakami came<br />to life in the majestic Victoria Theatre on September 14 and 15, 2007.<br />Connecting the beloved tale to modern audiences, who barely have any<br />name recall for Kalki or his protagonist Sivakami, choreographer Neila<br />Sathyalingam presented her vision of the story that has fascinated her<br />ever since she was a student in Kalakshetra in the 60s... Through a<br />sweeping 3 hour dance-theatre spectacle titled SIVKAMI, the dual<br />language operatic presentation contained English dialogues and Tamil<br />lyrics. <br /><br />A multiple award winning choreographer and cultural icon in Singapore<br />for over 30 years, Neila Sathyalingam has a penchant for large brush<br />strokes, having prepared dancers and floats for the annual Chingay<br />Chinese New Year processions down Orchard Road. The 65 actors and<br />dancers filled Victoria Theatre's majestic proscenium stage with the<br />throbbing spectacle of ambition, power, heroics and cunning. There<br />were so many memorable scenes, the major one for this writer being the<br />coming alive of the dance sculptures during the dream of sculptor<br />Ayanar Â– a moment that sent a 'frisson' through the audience who then<br />burst into spontaneous applause! <br /> <br />	<br />Reflecting Singaporean multicultural elements of Chinese / Malay /<br />Thai / Tamil craft and dance traditions into a cohesive whole is<br />difficult enough. One sees so much of work today in the name of<br />'globalization' that is often a mere pastiche and an unconvincing<br />mess. The intensity of Kalki's dialogue and the continuing horror of<br />war and bloodshed created an authentic slice of history as well as<br />painting a powerful contemporary metaphor about the futility of<br />battle. Through 21 scenes broken up into 4 acts with an intermission,<br />international audiences Â– many of them Europeans Â– were introduced for<br />the first time to a modern adaptation of this Tamil literary classic.  <br /><br />Krishnakshi, the guest artiste from India, as Sivakami was simply<br />superb. Through dance and dialogues, she held her own throughout the<br />play. Dedicated as the epitome of beauty, grace and the very soul of<br />the capital city Kanchi, Sivakami finds herself alone and abandoned<br />through the vagaries of fate and her own pride. In her final days, she<br />immerses herself in the service of Lord Ekambareswarar. Alone but not<br />forgotten, an iconic image representing an era of grace that ended<br />with an avoidable tragedy! Krishnakshi carried the character on her<br />expressive shoulders with maturity and a magnificent stage presence.  <br /><br />Selvanathan as Naganandhi was a convincing actor who conveyed his love<br />for art and his affinity for scheming. In the pivotal role as the<br />monk-brother of the marauding ruler Pulikesi, the struggle between his<br />love of art and duty to his brother was convincingly portrayed.<br />Noteworthy were his voice modulations during the furtive mourning of<br />Sivakami Â– the 'Kanchi Sundari,' who swoons after dancing on the<br />streets all day to save her people while his brother, the heartless<br />King Pulikesi threatens to torture the citizens of Kanchi, was<br />brilliant.  <br /><br />Sivakumar as Pulikesi, Emperor of the Chalukyas, who ravages Kanchi<br />and razes this enchanted city to the ground, was played with mature<br />measure and restraint. As the symbol of ego and ravenous pride,<br />Sivakumar maintained this clear diction throughout the play. The<br />moment when he holds the conquered Sivakami's face in his hands and<br />asks sarcastically, "Is it your youth or your art that makes my<br />brother Naganandi forget all his duties?" was performed with the<br />coiled anger of a merciless ruler. <br /><br />Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor Mathialagan who was<br />truly outstanding. An award winning actor on stage and TV, Mathialagan<br />brought great dignity to his all important role. As the spy Vajra Bahu<br />and as king of Kanchi, he held his own and manipulated his<br />conversations with seasoned maturity. As the king he was regal, as the<br />spy/strategist he conveyed the zeal and manipulative mind of an<br />informer. His body language was convincing as was his dialogue<br />delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to perfection that<br />gave audiences a character who was so deeply invested in his kingdom<br />and his people. Through his portrayal, the rapt audience felt his<br />palpable love for his capital city eulogized by poets in these<br />memorable words... <br />"Pushpeshi Jaati, Purusheshu Vishnu <br />Naareeshu Rambha, Nagareshu Kanchi" <br /><br />The crowd scenes during battles were particularly well directed, with<br />entries and exits always neat and well rehearsed. This spoke of the<br />choreographer's vast experience with a large cast and artistes from<br />varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds.  <br /><br />The Ravindra Drama group of Singapore collaborated with Neila<br />Sathyalingam's Apsara Arts dancers for this mammoth venture. The<br />mÃ©lange of dance and theatre, of spoken text and the sung/danced lyric<br />never outshone one another. This delicate balance was maintained<br />throughout, heightened by the multicultural orchestral score composed<br />by L Krishnan and Aravinth Kumaraswamy, gripping dialogues by Chennai<br />Koothu-P-Pattarai's Kumaravel, and lavish costumes designed by Neila<br />Sathyalingam.  <br /><br />The two performances were graced by two special dignitaries. On<br />opening night it was Mr. Tharman Shanmugharatnam, Minister for<br />Education and Second Minister of Finance. On the second day, Mr. Tommy<br />Koh, Chairman National Heritage Board. Both men were lavish in their<br />praise of Neila Sathyalingam's unswerving zeal for the promotion of<br />Indian dance and music in the rapidly changing face of Singapore. <br />   <br />The spectacular scenography for SIVAKAMI spoke of the 2-year<br />preparation Neila Sathyalingam and her able team had invested for this<br />production. For Neila, this is her swan song, or so she says. A<br />student of Kalakshetra for more than 20 years during the most creative<br />time of its founder Rukmini Arundale, Neila imbibed "Atthai's"<br />pan-Asian aesthetic while the legendary Ramayana series was being<br />created and performed. Always open to new influences within the<br />parameters of what is 'auchitya' or appropriate, all of Neila's<br />earlier productions reflect her open mindedness and her love of new<br />ideas and approaches to dance creation. In fact, she is a rare guru<br />who always watches the works of younger dancers in any genre Â–<br />classical, traditional, modern and contemporary! SIVAKAMI's<br />multicultural cast of Malays, Chinese and Indians also drew on each<br />culture's specialization in martial arts, movement vocabularies and<br />costume elements, which gave the show a truly Singaporean soul. <br /><br />Neila is acutely conscious of her Tamil roots and the rapidly<br />declining readership among Singaporean and global youth for classical<br />literature. Through SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM, she hoped to make her own<br />favourite serial reawaken her personal beliefs and love of India, the<br />land that is 'bhakti naadu,' 'pannbu naadu,' 'maanam maryada naadu.'  <br /><br />For this writer, having witnessed so many dance and music performances<br />over 50 years in Tamilnadu, the diasporic verve and old-world<br />commitment of the dancers and actors were most touching. Through<br />dance, music and theatre, these Singaporeans maintain contact with the<br />motherland they have all left behind many generations ago. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Ragothaman</div>

He was a ruler who was loved by his <br />people<br />  and who worked tirelessly to maintain peace for his people for<br />  twenty-five years ? when suddenly war loomed at his gates! King<br />  Pulikesi of the neighboring Chalukya Empire, was almost at the<br />  Pallava kingdom&#39;s door step with an menacing army of 16,000 <br />elephants,<br />  12,000 cavalry and over a lakh of foot soliders. News came as the<br />  army had reached Tungabadra River! Facing certain defeat, King<br />  Mahendra Pallava performed a magnificent feat of camouflage, <br />secrecy<br />  and political outmaneuvering to prolong peace for ten years, only <br />to<br />  lose his life in battle trying to save his beloved capital city <br />Kanchi<br />  ? the Pallava capital. <br />  <br />  This is the historical background that fuelled the brilliant mind <br />of<br />  Kalki Krishnamurthy for his memorable story SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM. <br />One<br />  of the most luminary writers of the 20th century, Kalki, as he was<br />  called with affection and awe, wove spellbinding narratives <br />creating<br />  fictional characters located in actual historical times. &#39;Ponniyin<br />  Selvan&#39; and &#39;Parthiban Kanavu&#39; are memorable for the richness of <br />their<br />  full blooded heroes and heroines located directly within actual<br />  historical events of South India. The stories, serialized in the<br />  immensely popular Tamil magazine Kalki, captured the imagination <br />of an<br />  entire generation of readers who would wait avidly for the next <br />issue<br />  of the magazine so that they could participate in the highs and <br />lows<br />  of the wonderfully etched characters. A runaway hit for 12 years <br />was<br />  his story of the dancing heroine of Kanchi, SIVAKMIYIN SAPATAM. The<br />  human life drama woven into the story was so believable and intense<br />  that millions were gripped with SIVAKAMI fever throughout these <br />years,<br />  many actually learning to read and enjoy the Tamil language through<br />  the colourful saga of kings, war and power struggles.  <br />    <br />  	<br />  Across the Indian Ocean in nearby Singapore, the tale of Sivakami <br />came<br />  to life in the majestic Victoria Theatre on September 14 and 15, <br />2007.<br />  Connecting the beloved tale to modern audiences, who barely have <br />any<br />  name recall for Kalki or his protagonist Sivakami, choreographer <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam presented her vision of the story that has fascinated <br />her<br />  ever since she was a student in Kalakshetra in the 60s... Through a<br />  sweeping 3 hour dance-theatre spectacle titled SIVKAMI, the dual<br />  language operatic presentation contained English dialogues and <br />Tamil<br />  lyrics. <br />  <br />  A multiple award winning choreographer and cultural icon in <br />Singapore<br />  for over 30 years, Neila Sathyalingam has a penchant for large <br />brush<br />  strokes, having prepared dancers and floats for the annual Chingay<br />  Chinese New Year processions down Orchard Road. The 65 actors and<br />  dancers filled Victoria Theatre&#39;s majestic proscenium stage with <br />the<br />  throbbing spectacle of ambition, power, heroics and cunning. There<br />  were so many memorable scenes, the major one for this writer being <br />the<br />  coming alive of the dance sculptures during the dream of sculptor<br />  Ayanar ? a moment that sent a &#39;frisson&#39; through the audience who <br />then<br />  burst into spontaneous applause! <br />   <br />  	<br />  Reflecting Singaporean multicultural elements of Chinese / Malay /<br />  Thai / Tamil craft and dance traditions into a cohesive whole is<br />  difficult enough. One sees so much of work today in the name of<br />  &#39;globalization&#39; that is often a mere pastiche and an unconvincing<br />  mess. The intensity of Kalki&#39;s dialogue and the continuing horror <br />of<br />  war and bloodshed created an authentic slice of history as well as<br />  painting a powerful contemporary metaphor about the futility of<br />  battle. Through 21 scenes broken up into 4 acts with an <br />intermission,<br />  international audiences ? many of them Europeans ? were introduced <br />for<br />  the first time to a modern adaptation of this Tamil literary <br />classic.   <br />  <br />  Krishnakshi, the guest artiste from India, as Sivakami was simply<br />  superb. Through dance and dialogues, she held her own throughout <br />the<br />  play. Dedicated as the epitome of beauty, grace and the very soul <br />of<br />  the capital city Kanchi, Sivakami finds herself alone and abandoned<br />  through the vagaries of fate and her own pride. In her final days, <br />she<br />  immerses herself in the service of Lord Ekambareswarar. Alone but <br />not<br />  forgotten, an iconic image representing an era of grace that ended<br />  with an avoidable tragedy! Krishnakshi carried the character on her<br />  expressive shoulders with maturity and a magnificent stage <br />presence.  <br />  <br />  Selvanathan as Naganandhi was a convincing actor who conveyed his <br />love<br />  for art and his affinity for scheming. In the pivotal role as the<br />  monk-brother of the marauding ruler Pulikesi, the struggle between <br />his<br />  love of art and duty to his brother was convincingly portrayed.<br />  Noteworthy were his voice modulations during the furtive mourning <br />of<br />  Sivakami ? the &#39;Kanchi Sundari,&#39; who swoons after dancing on the<br />  streets all day to save her people while his brother, the heartless<br />  King Pulikesi threatens to torture the citizens of Kanchi, was<br />  brilliant.  <br />  <br />  Sivakumar as Pulikesi, Emperor of the Chalukyas, who ravages Kanchi<br />  and razes this enchanted city to the ground, was played with mature<br />  measure and restraint. As the symbol of ego and ravenous pride,<br />  Sivakumar maintained this clear diction throughout the play. The<br />  moment when he holds the conquered Sivakami&#39;s face in his hands and<br />  asks sarcastically, "Is it your youth or your art that makes my<br />  brother Naganandi forget all his duties?" was performed with the<br />  coiled anger of a merciless ruler. <br />  <br />  Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor Mathialagan who was<br />  truly outstanding. An award winning actor on stage and TV, <br />Mathialagan<br />  brought great dignity to his all important role. As the spy Vajra <br />Bahu<br />  and as king of Kanchi, he held his own and manipulated his<br />  conversations with seasoned maturity. As the king he was regal, as <br />the<br />  spy/strategist he conveyed the zeal and manipulative mind of an<br />  informer. His body language was convincing as was his dialogue<br />  delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to perfection <br />that<br />  gave audiences a character who was so deeply invested in his <br />kingdom<br />  and his people. Through his portrayal, the rapt audience felt his<br />  palpable love for his capital city eulogized by poets in these<br />  memorable words... <br />  "Pushpeshi Jaati, Purusheshu Vishnu <br />  Naareeshu Rambha, Nagareshu Kanchi" <br />  <br />  The crowd scenes during battles were particularly well directed, <br />with<br />  entries and exits always neat and well rehearsed. This spoke of the<br />  choreographer&#39;s vast experience with a large cast and artistes from<br />  varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds.  <br />  <br />  The Ravindra Drama group of Singapore collaborated with Neila<br />  Sathyalingam&#39;s Apsara Arts dancers for this mammoth venture. The<br />  mÃ©Â¬Â¡nge of dance and theatre, of spoken text and the sung/danced <br />lyric<br />  never outshone one another. This delicate balance was maintained<br />  throughout, heightened by the multicultural orchestral score <br />composed<br />  by L Krishnan and Aravinth Kumaraswamy, gripping dialogues by <br />Chennai<br />  Koothu-P-Pattarai&#39;s Kumaravel, and lavish costumes designed by <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam.  <br />  <br />  The two performances were graced by two special dignitaries. On<br />  opening night it was Mr. Tharman Shanmugharatnam, Minister for<br />  Education and Second Minister of Finance. On the second day, Mr. <br />Tommy<br />  Koh, Chairman National Heritage Board. Both men were lavish in <br />their<br />  praise of Neila Sathyalingam&#39;s unswerving zeal for the promotion of<br />  Indian dance and music in the rapidly changing face of Singapore. <br />     <br />  The spectacular scenography for SIVAKAMI spoke of the 2-year<br />  preparation Neila Sathyalingam and her able team had invested for <br />this<br />  production. For Neila, this is her swan song, or so she says. A<br />  student of Kalakshetra for more than 20 years during the most <br />creative<br />  time of its founder Rukmini Arundale, Neila imbibed "Atthai&#39;s"<br />  pan-Asian aesthetic while the legendary Ramayana series was being<br />  created and performed. Always open to new influences within the<br />  parameters of what is &#39;auchitya&#39; or appropriate, all of Neila&#39;s<br />  earlier productions reflect her open mindedness and her love of new<br />  ideas and approaches to dance creation. In fact, she is a rare guru<br />  who always watches the works of younger dancers in any genre ?<br />  classical, traditional, modern and contemporary! SIVAKAMI&#39;s<br />  multicultural cast of Malays, Chinese and Indians also drew on each<br />  culture&#39;s specialization in martial arts, movement vocabularies and<br />  costume elements, which gave the show a truly Singaporean soul. <br />  <br />  Neila is acutely conscious of her Tamil roots and the rapidly<br />  declining readership among Singaporean and global youth for <br />classical<br />  literature. Through SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM, she hoped to make her own<br />  favourite serial reawaken her personal beliefs and love of India, <br />the<br />  land that is &#39;bhakti naadu,&#39; &#39;pannbu naadu,&#39; &#39;maanam maryada <br />naadu.&#39;  <br />  <br />  For this writer, having witnessed so many dance and music <br />performances<br />  over 50 years in Tamilnadu, the diasporic verve and old-world<br />  commitment of the dancers and actors were most touching. Through<br />  dance, music and theatre, these Singaporeans maintain contact with <br />the<br />  motherland they have all left behind many generations ago. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Ragothaman</div></blockquote></div>

He was a ruler who was loved by his <br />people<br />  and who worked tirelessly to maintain peace for his people for<br />  twenty-five years Â– when suddenly war loomed at his gates! King<br />  Pulikesi of the neighboring Chalukya Empire, was almost at the<br />  Pallava kingdom&#39;s door step with an menacing army of 16,000 <br />elephants,<br />  12,000 cavalry and over a lakh of foot soliders. News came as the<br />  army had reached Tungabadra River! Facing certain defeat, King<br />  Mahendra Pallava performed a magnificent feat of camouflage, secrecy<br />  and political outmaneuvering to prolong peace for ten years, only to<br />  lose his life in battle trying to save his beloved capital city <br />Kanchi<br />  Â– the Pallava capital. <br />  <br />  This is the historical background that fuelled the brilliant mind of<br />  Kalki Krishnamurthy for his memorable story SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM. One<br />  of the most luminary writers of the 20th century, Kalki, as he was<br />  called with affection and awe, wove spellbinding narratives creating<br />  fictional characters located in actual historical times. &#39;Ponniyin<br />  Selvan&#39; and &#39;Parthiban Kanavu&#39; are memorable for the richness of <br />their<br />  full blooded heroes and heroines located directly within actual<br />  historical events of South India. The stories, serialized in the<br />  immensely popular Tamil magazine Kalki, captured the imagination of <br />an<br />  entire generation of readers who would wait avidly for the next <br />issue<br />  of the magazine so that they could participate in the highs and lows<br />  of the wonderfully etched characters. A runaway hit for 12 years was<br />  his story of the dancing heroine of Kanchi, SIVAKMIYIN SAPATAM. The<br />  human life drama woven into the story was so believable and intense<br />  that millions were gripped with SIVAKAMI fever throughout these <br />years,<br />  many actually learning to read and enjoy the Tamil language through<br />  the colourful saga of kings, war and power struggles.  <br />    <br />  	<br />  Across the Indian Ocean in nearby Singapore, the tale of Sivakami <br />came<br />  to life in the majestic Victoria Theatre on September 14 and 15, <br />2007.<br />  Connecting the beloved tale to modern audiences, who barely have any<br />  name recall for Kalki or his protagonist Sivakami, choreographer <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam presented her vision of the story that has fascinated <br />her<br />  ever since she was a student in Kalakshetra in the 60s... Through a<br />  sweeping 3 hour dance-theatre spectacle titled SIVKAMI, the dual<br />  language operatic presentation contained English dialogues and Tamil<br />  lyrics. <br />  <br />  A multiple award winning choreographer and cultural icon in <br />Singapore<br />  for over 30 years, Neila Sathyalingam has a penchant for large brush<br />  strokes, having prepared dancers and floats for the annual Chingay<br />  Chinese New Year processions down Orchard Road. The 65 actors and<br />  dancers filled Victoria Theatre&#39;s majestic proscenium stage with the<br />  throbbing spectacle of ambition, power, heroics and cunning. There<br />  were so many memorable scenes, the major one for this writer being <br />the<br />  coming alive of the dance sculptures during the dream of sculptor<br />  Ayanar Â– a moment that sent a &#39;frisson&#39; through the audience who <br />then<br />  burst into spontaneous applause! <br />   <br />  	<br />  Reflecting Singaporean multicultural elements of Chinese / Malay /<br />  Thai / Tamil craft and dance traditions into a cohesive whole is<br />  difficult enough. One sees so much of work today in the name of<br />  &#39;globalization&#39; that is often a mere pastiche and an unconvincing<br />  mess. The intensity of Kalki&#39;s dialogue and the continuing horror of<br />  war and bloodshed created an authentic slice of history as well as<br />  painting a powerful contemporary metaphor about the futility of<br />  battle. Through 21 scenes broken up into 4 acts with an <br />intermission,<br />  international audiences Â– many of them Europeans Â– were introduced <br />for<br />  the first time to a modern adaptation of this Tamil literary <br />classic.   <br />  <br />  Krishnakshi, the guest artiste from India, as Sivakami was simply<br />  superb. Through dance and dialogues, she held her own throughout the<br />  play. Dedicated as the epitome of beauty, grace and the very soul of<br />  the capital city Kanchi, Sivakami finds herself alone and abandoned<br />  through the vagaries of fate and her own pride. In her final days, <br />she<br />  immerses herself in the service of Lord Ekambareswarar. Alone but <br />not<br />  forgotten, an iconic image representing an era of grace that ended<br />  with an avoidable tragedy! Krishnakshi carried the character on her<br />  expressive shoulders with maturity and a magnificent stage <br />presence.  <br />  <br />  Selvanathan as Naganandhi was a convincing actor who conveyed his <br />love<br />  for art and his affinity for scheming. In the pivotal role as the<br />  monk-brother of the marauding ruler Pulikesi, the struggle between <br />his<br />  love of art and duty to his brother was convincingly portrayed.<br />  Noteworthy were his voice modulations during the furtive mourning of<br />  Sivakami Â– the &#39;Kanchi Sundari,&#39; who swoons after dancing on the<br />  streets all day to save her people while his brother, the heartless<br />  King Pulikesi threatens to torture the citizens of Kanchi, was<br />  brilliant.  <br />  <br />  Sivakumar as Pulikesi, Emperor of the Chalukyas, who ravages Kanchi<br />  and razes this enchanted city to the ground, was played with mature<br />  measure and restraint. As the symbol of ego and ravenous pride,<br />  Sivakumar maintained this clear diction throughout the play. The<br />  moment when he holds the conquered Sivakami&#39;s face in his hands and<br />  asks sarcastically, "Is it your youth or your art that makes my<br />  brother Naganandi forget all his duties?" was performed with the<br />  coiled anger of a merciless ruler. <br />  <br />  Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor Mathialagan who was<br />  truly outstanding. An award winning actor on stage and TV, <br />Mathialagan<br />  brought great dignity to his all important role. As the spy Vajra <br />Bahu<br />  and as king of Kanchi, he held his own and manipulated his<br />  conversations with seasoned maturity. As the king he was regal, as <br />the<br />  spy/strategist he conveyed the zeal and manipulative mind of an<br />  informer. His body language was convincing as was his dialogue<br />  delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to perfection that<br />  gave audiences a character who was so deeply invested in his kingdom<br />  and his people. Through his portrayal, the rapt audience felt his<br />  palpable love for his capital city eulogized by poets in these<br />  memorable words... <br />  "Pushpeshi Jaati, Purusheshu Vishnu <br />  Naareeshu Rambha, Nagareshu Kanchi" <br />  <br />  The crowd scenes during battles were particularly well directed, <br />with<br />  entries and exits always neat and well rehearsed. This spoke of the<br />  choreographer&#39;s vast experience with a large cast and artistes from<br />  varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds.  <br />  <br />  The Ravindra Drama group of Singapore collaborated with Neila<br />  Sathyalingam&#39;s Apsara Arts dancers for this mammoth venture. The<br />  mÃ©lange of dance and theatre, of spoken text and the sung/danced <br />lyric<br />  never outshone one another. This delicate balance was maintained<br />  throughout, heightened by the multicultural orchestral score <br />composed<br />  by L Krishnan and Aravinth Kumaraswamy, gripping dialogues by <br />Chennai<br />  Koothu-P-Pattarai&#39;s Kumaravel, and lavish costumes designed by <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam.  <br />  <br />  The two performances were graced by two special dignitaries. On<br />  opening night it was Mr. Tharman Shanmugharatnam, Minister for<br />  Education and Second Minister of Finance. On the second day, Mr. <br />Tommy<br />  Koh, Chairman National Heritage Board. Both men were lavish in <br />their<br />  praise of Neila Sathyalingam&#39;s unswerving zeal for the promotion of<br />  Indian dance and music in the rapidly changing face of Singapore. <br />     <br />  The spectacular scenography for SIVAKAMI spoke of the 2-year<br />  preparation Neila Sathyalingam and her able team had invested for <br />this<br />  production. For Neila, this is her swan song, or so she says. A<br />  student of Kalakshetra for more than 20 years during the most <br />creative<br />  time of its founder Rukmini Arundale, Neila imbibed "Atthai&#39;s"<br />  pan-Asian aesthetic while the legendary Ramayana series was being<br />  created and performed. Always open to new influences within the<br />  parameters of what is &#39;auchitya&#39; or appropriate, all of Neila&#39;s<br />  earlier productions reflect her open mindedness and her love of new<br />  ideas and approaches to dance creation. In fact, she is a rare guru<br />  who always watches the works of younger dancers in any genre Â–<br />  classical, traditional, modern and contemporary! SIVAKAMI&#39;s<br />  multicultural cast of Malays, Chinese and Indians also drew on each<br />  culture&#39;s specialization in martial arts, movement vocabularies and<br />  costume elements, which gave the show a truly Singaporean soul. <br />  <br />  Neila is acutely conscious of her Tamil roots and the rapidly<br />  declining readership among Singaporean and global youth for <br />classical<br />  literature. Through SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM, she hoped to make her own<br />  favourite serial reawaken her personal beliefs and love of India, <br />the<br />  land that is &#39;bhakti naadu,&#39; &#39;pannbu naadu,&#39; &#39;maanam maryada <br />naadu.&#39;  <br />  <br />  For this writer, having witnessed so many dance and music <br />performances<br />  over 50 years in Tamilnadu, the diasporic verve and old-world<br />  commitment of the dancers and actors were most touching. Through<br />  dance, music and theatre, these Singaporeans maintain contact with <br />the<br />  motherland they have all left behind many generations ago. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Ragothaman</div></blockquote></div>
