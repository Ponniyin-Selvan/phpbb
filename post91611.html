When<br />we visited it during my last trip to india, I was<br />telling Ram that <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> deserves a special appreciation.<br /><br />I appreciate your intentions to know the feedback from<br />public. I am putting the below comments as a person<br />interested in history and have some interactions with<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and State archeology department.<br /><br />1. Completeness<br /><br />I request <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>/State arch. dept. to do the work<br />completely. When an excavation or temple study is<br />started, please try to complete all aspects like<br />architecture, inscriptions, iconography, etc. We see<br />many temples which were partly researched and history<br />was written based on those partial findings. Some<br />examples we can quote from our field work experience<br />are Thiruvalanjuzhi and Udayaloor.<br /><br />2. Controversies<br /><br />Some of the conclusions arrived on recent excavations<br />created some controversies among the historians. For<br />example, Dr.Sathiyamurthy said there are some old<br />brahmi scripts inside the urn excavated from<br />Adhichanallur. But Dr.Sathiyabhama said those are not<br />letters at all. This surfaced out when Iravatham<br />Mahadevan raised some questions during the conference<br />held in Tamil university couple of months ago. In the<br />same conference, Dr.Nadana Kasinathan (former State<br />arch. dept director) said he was not allowed to see<br />that urn. Such controversies could have been avoided<br />if brahmi experts were consulted before publishing the<br />news.<br /><br />3. Timeliness<br /><br />As Vidya pointed out in her mail, it is very important<br />to give complete information at right time. Still a<br />fullstop is pending for many issues like dating of<br />Adhichanallur urn, scripts inside the urn, date of<br />temple excavated near pulikkugai, etc. Unless the<br />complete information is given as soon as the<br />excavation is completed, it is difficult to filter<br />history out of it.<br /><br />4. Monuments<br /><br />As Satish stated in a feedback to one of varalaaru.com<br />articles, very few monuments have explanations about<br />the historical importance of monuments. Only the<br />caution board mentioning the law sections under which<br />this monument is protected are no use for public. In<br />those very few monuments also, information provided<br />were proved to be wrong in later days. It is very<br />important to update them and give right information to<br />public. The best examples are the boards kept at the<br />entrance of Five rathas and Big temple.<br /><br />5. Fund utilisation<br /><br />We heard that some years ago, funds allocated to State<br />arch. dept. by tamilnadu government for publishing the<br />research articles were returned back to the government<br />without publishing anything and government reduced the<br />amount after that. If such funds were utilised<br />properly and atleast 1 book was brought out, history<br />lovers would have been happy. Hope the samething is<br />not happening with <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>.<br /><br />6. Renovations<br /><br />I dont know the reason why stucco is pasted over the<br />sculptures during renovations. It was very painful<br />when we saw Gangai konda cholapuram sculptures after<br />renovation by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>. Entire vimanam and all sculptures<br />were covered with stucco and pink color paint. The<br />original beauty is lost. When we compared with old<br />photographs, the features also had changed a lot. Such<br />modified versions will definitely cause confusions<br />during the temple studies. Samething happened in<br />Kanchipuram Kailasanathar temple vimaanam and<br />Srinivasanallur Kurakkanathar temple also. In these 2<br />temples, only sculptures in ground floor are left as<br />it is. The temple Mahendravarmeswaram inside the<br />Kanchi kailasanathar complex is completely<br />restructured with stucco. Why such activities are<br />engaged?<br /><br />7. Politics<br /><br />I am not sure if this problem is easily resolvable. In<br />a way, what Satish said in his mail is true. Politics<br />is one of the obstacles in the path of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>. It is not<br />by politicians. But because of the internal politics<br />between officers. In the past 3 years, we have<br />witnessed many events related to the coldwar between<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and State archeology department as well as within<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> employees. I dont want to mention the names and<br />events elobarately since i am sure you are well aware<br />of such politics. But definitely this reduces the<br />productivity and a barrier to publish the findings.<br /><br />8. Commission<br /><br />Many people (we also used to) think that <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> employees<br />have less scope for putting money into their pockets<br />in illegal ways. But some recent incidents and<br />information from related people made us to think that<br />it is no lesser than a taluk office or road contractor<br />business. Sometimes ago, we were shocked hearing that<br />most of the officers in the hierarchy get a percentage<br />from the fund alloted for maintenance/renovation of<br />each monument. What is the point in blaming<br />politicians alone?<br /><br />9. New undertakings<br /><br />Heard that <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has stopped undertaking new monuments.<br />I dont know the reason behind such decision. The<br />ultimate result will reflect on monuments only. If <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym><br />is not undertaking, who else will have interest to<br />save them? Many more monuments will be added to the<br />list of Malaiyadikkurichi, Thiruppattur Kailasanathar,<br />etc. Dr.Kalaikkovan is trying for past several years<br />to make this Kailasanathar temple as a protected<br />monument. But no luck so far. Fortunately, Pullamangai<br />was protected after the joint effort by Dr.Kalaikkovan<br />and Dr.Kudavoil Balu.<br /><br />Hope you will take all these comments positively and<br />request you to let the group know how these points are<br />addressed by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal<br /><br />--- pssriraman  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>dear gokuol and hi to others,<br /> <br />  1.the activities of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> is multiferious. the<br />  principal<br />  responsibility is to maintain the monumnet listed<br />  unser the Act of<br />  1958.<br />  2. <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has some legal responsibilties being the<br />  agency of central<br />  government.<br /> <br />  3. <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has many branches - circle essentially to<br />  look after the<br />  monuments but with some time taking fieldwork.<br />  earlier explorations<br />  were given more importance and every one of us loved<br />  to fly off<br />  every month. it will take us to new villages unknown<br />  things and<br />  everything from prehistoric sites to modern remaisn<br />  will be seen and<br />  studied.<br /> <br />  4. of late, the fieldwork is limited due to official<br />  work.<br /> <br />  5. there major brances exclusively for excavations.<br /> <br />  6. local offices do small scale excavations.<br /> <br />  7. since we do not have impress the power that be<br />  unlike the state<br />  government department and our mps are less<br />  intruding, we do not come<br />  out with public show of excavated materials, mostly<br />  pottery.<br /> <br />  8. but we open up and interact with interested<br />  persons when they<br />  approach like sps, gokul and others. all we need is<br />  an interested<br />  ear.<br /> <br />  9. everybody is welcome to <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>, not only in chennai<br />  but to any small<br />  office anywhere in india.<br /> <br />  regards<br /> <br />  sriraman.p.s<br /> <br /> <br />    Dear all<br />   <br />    Mr.Sriraman is asking for all of our opinion in<br />  terms of what we<br />    expect out of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>. He is asking for our<br />  suggestions, feedback. I<br />  think<br />    it is a very good opportunity to share our<br />  expectations with him.<br />  I am<br />    sure he will convey all of our feedbacks to the<br />  Supt. Archaeologist<br />    Mrs.Sathyabhama and do the needful.<br />   <br />    I&#39;d like to list the following:<br />   <br />    * Would it be possible for <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> to conduct a public<br />  display of items<br />    after each major excavation &#40;Not necessarily with<br />  all the actual<br />    assets at all times - may be with photos&#41;. I think<br />  few have<br />  happened<br />    in the past but we are not aware of it. We can<br />  start off with<br />    Adhichchanallur and Mahamallapuram excavations of<br />  the last 2 years<br />    which yielded valuable assets.<br />   <br />    * Would it be possible to bring out a list of<br />  books published by<br />    <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>-South Zone with decent photos on the web ?<br />  Again, something<br />  exists<br />    already but not very attractive. Anything related<br />  to "web" all govt<br />    agencies need to go to NIC I believe.<br />   <br />    Other feedbacks welcome<br />   <br />    Thanks<br />    Gokul.S</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />__________________________________________________________<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">hi and to kamal<br /><br />my reactions<br /><br />1. Stating that a study about the past Â– represented in form <br />like artefacts, monuments, inscription etc., etc., - is complete is <br />absurd. Finding new facts, new interpretation adds charm and keeps <br />the interest alive in subject like history. The statement that your <br />team is confident that the monuments studied have been understood in <br />totality is something can not be accepted. A study should pose more <br />problems than solves it. Past is like wine and women. It intoxicates <br />you more when it becomes older. The research activities at <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> will <br />continue forever. In fact, when <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> was formed in 1860's then the <br />British government that a decade is sufficient to understand and <br />document Indian monumental heritage. What an underestimate? Possibly <br />they did not complete the work that is why there was still an <br />opportunity at Tiruvalanjuli.  <br />2. The controversy like the instance quoted by you is very <br />common. Are your team didn't hide any thing? Or escape away from <br />some statement uttered incidentally a la makutagama? To err is <br />human. To hide from error is mundane. To accept the error is <br />humility. One should choose. Anecdotes are there that even giants <br />have erred. Great people correct themselves immediately. The mundane <br />argue incessantly. <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> as an institution should not be pointed at <br />for issues raised by individuals, even though they belonged to that <br />institution.<br />3. The academics of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> always published in one way or other <br />the fundamental aspects of their research immediately in the <br />academic fora. The publication of significant results as news item <br />is also a part of this endeavour that we need to reach those <br />interested persons like you who do not have time and access to <br />academic fora. Such information is quite sufficient for <br />interpretation. But the crux of the issue with the other academics <br />is that they need the comprehensive information so that the context <br />with which the discoveries have been made could be verified.  <br />4. This is being attended to. Mainly problem arise from the <br />public themselves. They want us to substantiate the stories they <br />hear about the monuments. Then the language. We had to keep the <br />information in three languages. The board becomes so large it <br />irritates the connoisseurs. They in turn complain. Then the <br />simplicity of language. In my experience, writing a 100 word note on <br />Five rathas is the most difficult task than writing a book on <br />Tiruvalanjuli. But 100 word note will be read by lakhs. 100 page <br />book will not be even read by 10.That is the paradox. <br />5. The fund utilisation, in general, is much better in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>. And <br />the spending is just and honest and spent for the purpose it is <br />meant for.  <br />6. Applying a fine stucco layer over the old worn out stucco <br />cover is an accepted conservation measure and is a traditional, time <br />tested method. Every conservation decision is taken in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> after a <br />comprehensive analysis of problems on hand. Conserve and Preserve <br />has different meanings. Going to detail will lengthen the reply.  <br />7. Which organisation is bereft of politics? Politics in its <br />many avatars exists everywhere. Few individuals keep them away. Some <br />tend to live by it. The new dame, so well paid, IT organisations too <br />has politics at all levels. Politics exists even in family!!! It is <br />a common human malaise like cold. Live with it. The consequences for <br />people in government get is getting punished/criticised, because <br />they are paid with the public money. In private organisation, you <br />simply quit and still employed in a higher grade and pay in the <br />competitor firm.   <br />8. The entire financial and human resource of India, if not <br />more, is required to preserve India's heritage. How many of us are <br />ready to share the burden? To how many ECONOMISTS preserving the <br />heritage is an indicator of growth? Rajaraja mobilised his every <br />resource to create a great edifice. How much of our resources are <br />spent on preserving them? Individually, those, who are committed, <br />spend our resources, mainly time, to the maximum. Had we not spent <br />that much time in sharing our knowledge with persons? In a state <br />where there is severe resource crunch, heritage is given the least <br />priority. <br />9. Institutions are made up of individuals. If individuals are <br />good, the institutions are good. Malaise is there everywhere. They <br />need to be cured.

			<div class="content">VaNakkam<br /><br />very happy to read mails on unpublishesd reports on <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym><br /><br />my opinion based on my personal perceptionon realities.<br /><br />Basically all government offices depend on decision making top <br />management and administrative people.<br /><br />in orissa intersted people of archeology &related people on history<br />runnning behind accounts people for audit and other claims.<br /><br />so many un identical people like us running for survival.<br /><br />in orissa ,is treasure of un discoverd history burried under the <br />forest ,earth etc.<br /><br />But presentadminstrative measures not allowed any one to do their <br />field of interst except money and protection for their families.<br /><br />you know for all india epicrphical records and finding u have to run <br />only to mysore.<br />(sriraman and other deepartment people can accept this)<br /><br />please read all epicraphical indica volumes , plates lying on the <br />mysore museum ,copper plates,manuscripts lying on the particular <br />centers can tell the truth.<br /><br />If like INTACH,Sharma heritage centre, Rajamanikanar research <br />institute,pudokottai library,rojar muttahiya research <br />institutes,Reach foundation and many more their services to the past <br />history.<br /><br />please initiate peoples to do more work start from ur surroundings.<br /><br />s.balasubramani B+<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br />  <br />  <br />  Know what is the easiest title to obtain.- HISTORIAN<br />  anybody can go about , climb a few temples, take a few photographs, <br />  read a few inscriptions all in a couple of years and claim to be <br />a <br />  complete historian.<br />  <br />  then you can write articles, give opinions, challenge career <br />  historians who have spent a lifetime on these issues and generally <br />  go about saying everybody else is wrong . only we are right.<br />  <br />  TRY DOING this in physics or chemistry. you cant. for everything <br />  there is a verifiable commodity or issue. you cant even do it in <br />  geography. you can get away with it in history only and quite some <br />  people seem to know it well.<br />  <br />  and Fault finding of recent is the biggest thing that can get <br />  somebody some publicity.<br />  when a general press article comes about some historical discovery  <br />a <br />  hastily constructed article appears in Varalaaru.com saying that <br />  discovery is false.<br />  the time gap between the two is so less that we can see people have <br />  not paused even to think.or visit the place for a re-look. thats <br />  mainly because of the know all attitude.<br />  but of recent these type of articles have given varalaaru.com such <br />a <br />  negative outlook. like the sole crusader out to disprove everything.<br />  I only hope articles dont appear in aananda vikadan about MGR <br />samadhi <br />  or Anna Samathi for varalaaru .com is sure to comment even on their <br />  authenticity.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "pssriraman"  <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    hi and to kamal<br />    <br />    my reactions<br />    <br />    1. Stating that a study about the past Â– represented in form <br />    like artefacts, monuments, inscription etc., etc., - is complete <br />is <br />    absurd. Finding new facts, new interpretation adds charm and <br />keeps <br />    the interest alive in subject like history. The statement that <br />your <br />    team is confident that the monuments studied have been understood <br />  in <br />    totality is something can not be accepted. A study should pose <br />more <br />    problems than solves it. Past is like wine and women. It <br />  intoxicates <br />    you more when it becomes older. The research activities at <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> <br />will <br />    continue forever. In fact, when <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> was formed in 1860&#39;s then the <br />    British government that a decade is sufficient to understand and <br />    document Indian monumental heritage. What an underestimate? <br />  Possibly <br />    they did not complete the work that is why there was still an <br />    opportunity at Tiruvalanjuli.  <br />    2. The controversy like the instance quoted by you is very <br />    common. Are your team didn&#39;t hide any thing? Or escape away from <br />    some statement uttered incidentally a la makutagama? To err is <br />    human. To hide from error is mundane. To accept the error is <br />    humility. One should choose. Anecdotes are there that even giants <br />    have erred. Great people correct themselves immediately. The <br />  mundane <br />    argue incessantly. <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> as an institution should not be pointed <br />at <br />    for issues raised by individuals, even though they belonged to <br />that <br />    institution.<br />    3. The academics of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> always published in one way or other <br />    the fundamental aspects of their research immediately in the <br />    academic fora. The publication of significant results as news <br />item <br />    is also a part of this endeavour that we need to reach those <br />    interested persons like you who do not have time and access to <br />    academic fora. Such information is quite sufficient for <br />    interpretation. But the crux of the issue with the other <br />academics <br />    is that they need the comprehensive information so that the <br />context <br />    with which the discoveries have been made could be verified.  <br />    4. This is being attended to. Mainly problem arise from the <br />    public themselves. They want us to substantiate the stories they <br />    hear about the monuments. Then the language. We had to keep the <br />    information in three languages. The board becomes so large it <br />    irritates the connoisseurs. They in turn complain. Then the <br />    simplicity of language. In my experience, writing a 100 word note <br />  on <br />    Five rathas is the most difficult task than writing a book on <br />    Tiruvalanjuli. But 100 word note will be read by lakhs. 100 page <br />    book will not be even read by 10.That is the paradox. <br />    5. The fund utilisation, in general, is much better in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym>. And <br />    the spending is just and honest and spent for the purpose it is <br />    meant for.  <br />    6. Applying a fine stucco layer over the old worn out stucco <br />    cover is an accepted conservation measure and is a traditional, <br />  time <br />    tested method. Every conservation decision is taken in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> after <br />a <br />    comprehensive analysis of problems on hand. Conserve and Preserve <br />    has different meanings. Going to detail will lengthen the reply.  <br />    7. Which organisation is bereft of politics? Politics in its <br />    many avatars exists everywhere. Few individuals keep them away. <br />  Some <br />    tend to live by it. The new dame, so well paid, IT organisations <br />  too <br />    has politics at all levels. Politics exists even in family!!! It <br />is <br />    a common human malaise like cold. Live with it. The consequences <br />  for <br />    people in government get is getting punished/criticised, because <br />    they are paid with the public money. In private organisation, you <br />    simply quit and still employed in a higher grade and pay in the <br />    competitor firm.   <br />    8. The entire financial and human resource of India, if not <br />    more, is required to preserve India&#39;s heritage. How many of us <br />are <br />    ready to share the burden? To how many ECONOMISTS preserving the <br />    heritage is an indicator of growth? Rajaraja mobilised his every <br />    resource to create a great edifice. How much of our resources are <br />    spent on preserving them? Individually, those, who are committed, <br />    spend our resources, mainly time, to the maximum. Had we not <br />spent <br />    that much time in sharing our knowledge with persons? In a state <br />    where there is severe resource crunch, heritage is given the <br />least <br />    priority. <br />    9. Institutions are made up of individuals. If individuals are <br />    good, the institutions are good. Malaise is there everywhere. <br />They <br />    need to be cured. Not publicised.<br />    regards<br />    sriraman.p.s.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Sorry to intervene. I have stopped replying to such issues as I have learnt<br />to live in a co-existing way becoz friends turn foe for no mistake of mine.<br />But after reading things going on, I would only say one thing- and request<br />members not to continue for my reply as a thread. I agree fully with<br />Mr.Sriraman. I have been fortunate to move closely with the greats like<br />Dr.T.Satyamurthy, thanks to our temple revival organisation the<br />R.E.A.C.HFoundation which was successfully registered and plans are<br />afoot to rebuild<br />the Uthiramerur Kailasanatha temple. He is one man with so much knowledge<br />and experience, but has the greatest virtue of remaining aploitical when<br />adversities or unsavoury comments come forth. He just clears technical<br />doubts, when asked for. HE replies with correct documentation and theroy<br />when a detail is dealt with. That's the sign of a true historian. Also, when<br />help is needed to estimate the expenses for any reconstruction of a temple,<br />or to read a stone scripture, he immediately sends his ex-<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> friends or<br />collegues to complete the task. I was also thinking it would benefit guys if<br />we send them to varalaaru.com. Later when I found that only few want to own<br />articles as well as history (lol) and in that process, also the name they<br />could get along with (varalaaru.com), I resisted myself doing so. Sorry to<br />say this members. True history is lying somewhere. We need to be a learner<br />and an observer than become authoritarians. This is for the sake of<br />honouring true historians and not to create a blemish to their work done, so<br />far; Let us learn facts of history.I am sure, except a few in our group<br />(countable) most are novices in history.<br />No intention of insulting members of varalaaru. If they wish to stop<br />contacting me for any help I would render, it is their choice. I am what I<br />am, ready to help anyone, registration procedures, running around to<br />organise things, meetings, for arranging temple visits, take snaps or write<br />on the visits etc, and to hold a BIG BOWL TO BEG ( no shame on that) for<br />REACH foundation to rebuild temples.<br />Thanks for your valuable time.<br />Chandrasekaran (plasticschandra)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />=====<br />People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't<br />believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people<br />who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find<br />them, make them.<br />- George Bernard Shaw<br />==============================</div>
