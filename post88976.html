			<div class="content">Dear Pandiyan<br /><br />Initially, Sanskrit was available to everyone. knowledge of vedas was however restricted to the brahmanas (brahamana of vedic ages is different from today's brahmin).But again, over time, what you say could have happened, the base probably got clouded. Lord Krsna explains the 4 castes in the Gita, technically a family can have all people for all castes.<br />The best example of how this degenerated may be explained with the saint ramanuja story of preaching the mantra from temple top.<br />Technically it was quite complex to mix both languages, thats a fascinating aspect of thirupugazh, a classic blend of multiple languages in the praise of the lord.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Tamil Arul Pandiyan mPandiyan <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2007 12:07:34 PM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?<br /><br /><br /><br />The texts about war, war-medicine, yoga and everything else was written in Sanskrit.<br />Only Brahmins could understand Sanskrit as they were privileged.

			<div class="content">Straw man<br /><br /><br /><br />The argument is like this -<br />If you remove/disparge all Sangam/Tamil Kings contribution then there will be no concept of family, language(grammar) or writing(script) to talk of. Tamils would have been living like animals.<br /><br />But even otherwise taking your argument further the British/British bureaucrats did eliminate lot of sources which did not agree with their worldview in the name of enemy propaganda. Ex - the villagers records of people who opposed the British. They did leave out a number of plates from Ganga dynasty terming it as spurious as well as other inscriptions. They have dropped out of the view completely now.<br /><br />The British/British bureaucrats sources are propaganda material given a semblance of normalcy/reality. It is plain vain self-glorification for the British and their Indian bureaucrats.<br /><br />We know what the american anthropologist are doing supporting the miltary right now.<br /><br />For all we care the 'Bhumihar Brahmin' might have been the precursor to the ones in Bihar today, fighting for their rights in 1857 to practice their crafts on Yadavs. To get their true story it might be better to contact the Yadavs of North India.<br /><br />I do not want to get into the question of British vs Indian discussion which just concluded in the list.<br /><br />My initial question was related to kshatriyas vs Tamil society.

			<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />Let keep the discussions as far as possible closer to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. I had the <br />good fortune of attending a talk organised by the singapore library <br />last evening - the topic was <br /><br />The Imperial Cholas: An 11th Century Example of Regional Power Play <br />in Southeast Asia<br /><br />the paper was presented by a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow, Mr <br />Prasanna Weerawardane. ( will circulate once i get a copy).<br /><br />While the paper was interesting, there were a few grey areas, thanks <br />to the little knowledge i gained by being a part of this group and <br />reading the archives i took this up and it was well appareciated. <br />listing below: <br /><br />The paper projected the cholas as a warring clan - eager to invade, <br />raid countries for furthering their interests: <br /><br />- examples were cited from the chornicle ( culavamsa) - of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> <br />taking back untold treasures, pillage the anuradhapura vihara etc.<br />- unlike other campaigns - the cholas wanted to annexe lanka for its <br />resources.<br />- the cholas ill treated the royal women and took away king mahinda <br />IV and his wife to madura where he died.<br /><br />- the first attack on srivijaya by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> was because they went on a <br />specific disinformation on the chola power - leading to the first <br />envoy from chola land being treated as an insignificant kingdom by <br />the sung dynasty.<br />- the profits from these raids were used to shower gifts on the big <br />temple<br />- the second raid on srivijaya by kullottunga was caused by the <br />srilankan king seeking his aid to fight the cholas - the help was by <br />providing products from the peninsula to aid the srilankan army/pay <br />for their expenses. the attack was against this aid.<br />- the buddhist viharam in nagapatinam was set up bascially to attact <br />trade.<br /><br />while it was heartening to note the amount of interest the cholas <br />still hold among the intellectual faternity here, my arguments were <br />as below: <br /><br />1. The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period and the <br />incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did interfere in <br />the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations with the <br />pandya crown.<br /><br />2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya diadems - <br />which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his state. so <br />the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by <br />closing out the pandya for good.<br /><br />3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to stay in a <br />palace and he lived a further 12 years there before eventually <br />dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style of <br />disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the head off -<br />yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years <br /><br />4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar of <br />krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were <br />frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there was a <br />sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported through <br />generous grants by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>,and these grants were further re instated by <br />kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the mahavamsa <br />to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed. <br /><br />5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify the <br />chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming the usng <br />dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for such a <br />massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was paying <br />tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king.</div>
