Its just a way of making fashion statement! In fact, I stayed with three girls who are said to be Tamilians(born and brought up in Madras). But none of them knew how to read or write tamil. If they were told that they did not know their mother tongue, they would scorn back saying that they knew their "rashtrabaasha" and that was enough.<br />I dont know where the link got broken....

When I did my schooling (andha kaaalathula-nnu nan arambikkala, I am not *old*), with Hindi as II language, we also had French (I know its still there as sec lang). Lots of students took French as sec lang, because it was easier to get a high score in that, which, eventually will boost up the total. So with that as the anchor, they limited their access to tamil books and literature, thus ending up like most youngsters in the vikatan interview.<br />Take a look at how Tamil is being killed in Movies.

			<div class="content">Warning : This is a pretty long mail.<br />But the younger generation is not to be blamed entirely. Look at the syllabus they have got to read! I remember when I was in school, most of my friends took hindi as their second language and sanskrit as their third language. Tamizhukku idame illai. But decision was not entirely made by them.. Their parents were the main instruments behind this.<br />I fully subscribe to your views prathiba. Parents play a vital role.Take the case in my family. My sister had most of her schooling after in various parts of india and she had to learn&nbsp;kannada and telugu apart from hindi&nbsp;all through the way. But when we came back to tamilnadu she was not good at tamil and&nbsp;my parents insisted on taking tamil as her second language.Now shes doign good in tamil.&nbsp;Apart from parents, the tamil teachers u&nbsp;get is also important. I would say my interest in tamil developed all because of excellent teachers i had in schools.&nbsp;<br />I dont know where the link got broken.... What went wrong in between?.... Of course there is a good number of people who do appreciate the beauty of Tamil in our generation too. But why does a great number of people not even know how to read or write their own mother tongue? Why have people stopped appreciating their own culture?<br />As long as people were interested in&nbsp;govt jobs and other clerical jobs&nbsp;we had a lot of tamil scholars and people were giving importance to tamil. But when the focus shifted to professional streams like engineering and technology the need for tamil diminished. Even today people going for engineering courses need not score well in exams.I think the govt also played a parting spoiling the link. Here i&nbsp;have a friend who came from malaysia and he is very good at tamil than most of my friends from TN. The reason, he went to tamil schools in malaysia and had his second language as tamil. The malaysian govt never discriminated tamil.&nbsp;Aa a whole everthing right&nbsp;from govt to society must change to&nbsp;stop this rot.<br />Personally speaking, it was due to my own interest that I started reading good Tamil books apart from my school books(of course, I was looked down upon for that. My friends thought that I was an old fashioned girl). <br />This is 200% true. I faced this for a while after coming to US. When i was reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and sivakamiyin sabadham people had names for me (one of them is village boy). But after seeing all our mails and discussion these days they developed a respect for me and of course tamil(thanks for all your mails). I think these kind of perspective changes is more important if tamil has to stay. This can be acheived through media.I think this is not in our hand except some instances like <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> interview in sun tv.<br />Regarding pronounciation "aAla vidunga sami "<br />Regards<br />Arul&nbsp;MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service:  2 months FREE*</div>

			<div class="content">Dear all<br />There are schools which teach tamil heritage and indian cultures and values ...bhratiya vidya bhavan is one example.<br />It was a very valid point that currently language is not important and people have the option of hindi french and german as second language to boost their totals.<br />I learned Kannada s my second language when we were in mysore and when we came back to tamilnadu stuggled to read tamil and the quickfix solution read all kumudam,kalki and anandhavikatan..in 2nd std..that started the desire te read in tamil nalyse tamil....and both me and my brother owe that to uor parents who encouraged our desire in the language when all our friends were told off for concentrating on language.<br />Sridhar<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Yahoo!
