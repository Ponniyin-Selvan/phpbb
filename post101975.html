			<div class="content">Dear all...<br /><br />Day 2 (Saturday, February 8th):<br /><br />Day 2 started in a more leisurely way than Day 1- we started at 7.30,<br />finished breakfast, and set off on our way to the Periya Koil, the first on<br />our agenda.<br /><br />The Periya Koil, as many people have talked about in many different ways, is<br />a masterpiece. Built by the hero of our story, its size, structure, its<br />dazzling dimensions have earned it a place in World Heritage. What more can<br />one say?<br /><br />In side the temple complex, we split up. Half of us went wandering around<br />the enormous corridors that surround the temple, some of us ambled over to<br />the Nandi. Mr.Vishwaksenan disappeared to hunt out the Kalki agent for that<br />area, and they appeared in a few minutes, right in the middle of a<br />discussion about the temple.<br /><br />Mr. Balakumaran had said in his tape that the so-called 'single stone' at<br />the head of the vimanam wasn't a single stone at all, but was made of many<br />stones set very close together ("...aaranju chulai maathiri...")- and with<br />luck, the temple authorities agreed to open up the first level of the<br />temple- a part which is generally closed to the public, and which requires<br />special admission if one has to see it. All of us trooped up the stone steps<br />up to the first level. They led upto a terrace, with the gopuram rising to<br />our left. The Kalki agent led us to the doorway and unlocked it.<br /><br />We stepped inside a dark corridor, which ran to our left and right, and<br />vanished into darkness. Another set of steps led to a doorway which looked<br />onto a chamber over the garba griham. It was barred at one end (because we<br />mustn?t stand right on top of the garba griham)- and then the spotlights<br />were switched on. We raised our heads and looked straight up to the top of<br />the gopuram. The hollow structure spiralled into the darkness right up to<br />the very top. It was a magnificent architectural feat. How they ever managed<br />to do this so many thousands of years ago is simply amazing...<br /><br /><br />Outside, the dark corridor was lit up, and we could see sculptures detailing<br />the various dance poses of Lord Nataraja. The panel above the sculptures was<br />filled with vague colours and outlines. These, we learnt, were paintings<br />showing King Raja raja and his consorts, and other scenes. Almost nothing<br />remained of them. The dance poses, on the other hand, were minute- each one<br />of them was exquisitely detailed. (Dancer Padma Subramanian once visited<br />this place, it seems, and did some serious research for a whole fortnight).<br /><br />Some of the dance poses weren't completed- blocks of stone, chiselled and<br />ready for sculpting, had been left empty- they seemed to waiting for the<br />hands of a great sculptor to touch them, who would shake them out of their<br />sleep and convert them into gleaming figurines...<br /><br />This chamber containing the dance panels, with its dark corridor running<br />'inside' the gopuram is quite an architectural feat in itself. Its walls,<br />rising upwards, broaden gradually to meet the outer gopuram at the top.<br />Magnificent.<br /><br />After another bout of photographs, we descended to the ground (literally and<br />imaginatively:-), and began a walking tour of the corridors that surround<br />the temple. The paintings on the walls had been disfigured (by 'English'<br />kalvettus, as someone quipped)- but for all that, their beauty was not<br />impaired. One could only marvel at the vision of Raja raja- not just his<br />ambition to produce one of the greatest temples in South India, but his<br />magnanimity in acknowledging the fact that other people (his wives, and<br />those who had contributed wealth and effort in building the temple) had put<br />in valuable effort in completing the temple.<br /><br />"...Shri Raajaraajeeswara mudaiyaarkku naan kuduthanavum akkan kudduthanavum<br />nam pendugal kuduthanavum matrum kuduthaar kuduthanavum..."<br /><br />After all, he could just have said that he built the temple, and left it at<br />that. Who would have dared to oppose him?<br /><br />(Seems he was taking a bath in the Chozha Maligai in Thanjai, when he<br />ordered etching inscriptions into stone:-)<br /><br />After visiting the other sannithis and lounging about the lawns for a while,<br />we left the temple reluctantly. It was 11 AM when we started towards<br />Saraswathi Mahal (Periya Koil had made us stay an hour more than we<br />intended:-). Since we wanted to make good time to Kodikarai, we stayed in<br />Saraswathi Mahal just long enough to take a sweeping look at it- not more<br />than half an hour. (what we looked through included the Maratha dresses,<br />weapons, kitchen utensils and other odds and ends. I especially liked the<br />'thengai thuruvi':-)<br /><br />One of the guardian angels of Thanjavur, the 'Nisumba Sudhani' (described by<br />Balakumaran in his tape as quite a hideous entity) was on our agenda- the<br />temple still exists, but is known as the 'Vada Badhra kaali (info- Mr.<br />Sunder Bharadwaj) temple. Since it was nearing twelve, we decided to skip<br />it. Lunch was finished quickly in Thanjai, and we set off at 1.30 PM - to<br />Point Calimere.<br /><br /><br />We reached Kodaikarai by 5 PM ( around 100 Kms). The roads were not too bad,<br />we made good time, really (Passing the 'Raamar Paadham' on the way, and<br />uppalams, signaling the approach of the sea). Our first stop, naturally, was<br />the Kuzhagar Koil. A big, graceful structure with graying walls loomed up in<br />front of us with a high mathil suvar. Kodikarai proper was 4 kms from the<br />Koil. (Apparently, Poonghuzhali jumped down from the mathil and sprinted all<br />the 4kms to the beach. Quite in keeping with her character!)<br /><br />We took a tour of the temple, which stood majestically, with a few huts at<br />the side. Thankfully, this was not quite so dilapidated as some<br />others(probably due to the thiruppani that seems to have been done- in<br />1940s). There were some obvious additions- the brick-paved floor, for<br />example. The sculptures surrounding the sannithi were in good condition too.<br />And this is where we took the photo of the combination lock (which<br />Krupashankar has posted in his website<br />(<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/shankarkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/shankarkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg</a><!-- m -->)- the one where the<br />archagar is holding it like an <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>47:-). (There is a reference to this lock<br />in this week's Kalki issue too- dated 16.02.2003 under the section 'Remote'.<br />Apparently, it was mentioned in the 'Kalach chuvadu' section in Jaya TV.)<br /><br />Kamal decided to show off his driving abilities by rushing the van at us:-)-<br />and we took some photos here too. The approach road to the temple is<br />well-paved and the whole area is neat and tidy (in spite of scrubby bushes<br />abounding all over the place)-obviously, it has been re-furbished since<br />Kalki's times. Kuzhagar is no longer all that alone.<br /><br />At 5.30 PM, we started towards the beach- and it proved to be the best<br />evening in the trip:-)<br /><br />We stopped at the forest department's place first- we needed special<br />permission to get to the beach. After suitably arranging matters, we took<br />off. (The beach brought on talk about the trip to Sri Lanka). The road ran<br />through the village and entered scrubland. After a while we came to a gate,<br />after passing which, we entered the real Kodikarai- described by Kalki.<br />Thorny shrubs grew in clumps all over the vast, flatland, stretching away<br />into the horizon. Deer, grazing patiently, threw startled glances at our<br />approach, and gambolled into the shrubbery (just as Poonghuzhali saw them).<br />Some of them suddenly jumped high in the air- we wondered if there were any<br />'puthai kuzhis' there. The gound seemed firm in most places, and slightly<br />muddled in others.<br /><br /><br />The mud road meandered through more shrubs, some growing so thickly that<br />there were a few possible sites for the 'maraindha mandapam' <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />, twisting<br />and turning. A few cows strayed about lazily. Finally, a few minutes later,<br />the sea appeared- little waves flowing gently to the shore, and the blue<br />waters fading into the horizon- exactly as in 'Ponniyin Selvan'.<br /><br />One could easily picture Vandhiyathevan trying to wash himself in the sea,<br />desperate to get himself clean:-). There was a lonely brick structure right<br />on the beach- the remains of some long gone lighthouse of some bygone era,<br />perhaps. There was a curious hole in it- probably a window embrasure, and we<br />all took turns, sticking our heads through it.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The setting sun threw its slanting rays through the 'window', and the sea<br />shore was converted into an idyllic spot, stretching away on all sides. It<br />was completely empty-except for us. Our first instinct was to get into the<br />sea, which we did. Krupashankar and Kamal emulated a Veera Saivan and<br />Vaishnavan-both had their hands on the other's neck- and the former promptly<br />sat down in the water (which was splendidly cool after the hot drive).<br /><br />We spent an hour there. splashing through the water to our heart's content.<br />Almost everyone, I think, pictured Poonghuzhali and her Kolli-vai pisaasus<br />there:-)- and indulged in a frantic photo-session. God knew what<br />Krupashankar was trying to do in the sea- we suddenly heard agonized yells<br />and looked back to see him scrabbling wildly after his slippers, which had<br />floated away on the waves:-).<br /><br />It was a delightful hour. The waves glinted in the last rays of the sun, and<br />the marshland glowed in an unearthly light. Shadows fell everywhere,<br />suddenly transforming the sea-shore into another world- one full of strange<br />and beautiful entities. I for one fully expected Ravidasan to emerge out of<br />the sand dunes,:-)<br /><br />And then, it was time to go. By 6.30 PM, a tired but exultant <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> crew<br />marched to the van, full of sea-water, shells and loads of Kodikarai sand-<br />only to be told sternly by our driver that he was not going to have his<br />clean van soiled by us in all our sand and filth. "enga venaa ukkarunga,<br />Mela venumnaa ukkarunga, anaa ulle gille vanthu asingam panneenga..."<br /><br />It was at that moment, I think, that we all went crazy.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />[Later, we were all pretty sure that Poonghuzhali's 'aavi', floating around<br />the beaches of Kodikarai in spirit form, must have entered us all as<br />suitable to carry out her wishes- nothing else would explain what we<br />did.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />]<br /><br />One and all were hit by the same idea all at once. Kamal and Krupa darted<br />towards the rear, followed by Sathya, me, Anuradha, Lavanya, Radhika and<br />Viji- and before anyone knew what was happening, all of us had scrambled up<br />the slim ladder to the top of the carrier! It was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of a squeeze on top,<br />of course, with so many people- but that added to the general delight. All<br />the elders kept telling us that we were bound to fall off, that we'd have a<br />tough time making it to the vilage in one piece- and all their words fell on<br />deaf ears. We were determined on a 'crazy African Safari' (as Mr. Sharma put<br />it), and nothing would stop us.<br /><br />The van driver gave up his eforts to get us down, and started his vehicle,<br />which gave a lurch and nearly upset some of us.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And then started a weird and wonderful ride through the marshes of<br />Kodikarai- twilight had set in, the view from the top rolled away before our<br />eyes in all directions for miles, the sky was streaked with the blues and<br />pinks of sunset- in a word, it was superb.<br /><br />The van went slowly, but there were the unavoidable humps and bumps in the<br />road, sending us all into yells whenever they happened. Krupashankar<br />proposed a contest to see who could stand up on the carrier, Lavanya was<br />seized by a desire to sing 'Alai kadalum oynthirukka..." (which she did:-),<br />and all of us were caught by the wonderful scenery. No deer were present,<br />but we suddenly came upon a lone and solitary...wild black horse, gambolling<br />in the flatlands! Of course, it must have been the horse ridden by the Oomai<br />Rani:-).<br /><br />The original 'safari' was to have been until the gates of Kodikarai- but we<br />voted to ride on until the village was reached.<br /><br />Sea-birds flew overheard, darkness was closing in, the lighthouse started<br />flashing (the only 'kolli-vai pisaasu' we could see) and the sea-wind<br />rippled across us. All around us, bushes and shrubs weaved along the road.<br />Some one from inside the van yelled to ask if we were all there on the roof,<br />and how many of us had been bumped off. The van obligingly gave another<br />lurch and set everyone screeching. All the animals and spirits must have<br />heard us for miles around:-)<br /><br />Telephone wires began appearing, the mark of civlization- and then came the<br />agonizing question- we had climbed up easily enough, would climbing down be<br />that easy (especially Anuradha, -"...naan nadakkum pothE thoppu thoppunnu<br />vizhuven...":-)???<br /><br />But we managed it. (see Krupa's photos:-). All the elders promptly got off<br />the van and stood around us, grinning and marking our 'progress' and<br />commenting wildly on how we must get down, where we must place our feet and<br />everything else. The locals gaped at this spectacular show.<br /><br />Finally, all our dust left on the carrier, we settled down in our wet<br />clothes inside the van, playing 'Anthakshari' and generally fooling about.<br />Night had fallen and Kodikarai was left behind. Kudanthai was the night<br />halt, and when we reached it after three hours, and checked in Hotel<br />Chela's, all of us were ready for our rest.<br /><br />(To be continued...)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br />The new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content">Pavithra that was really well written. Kalakitte.<br />All,<br />We were fortunate to be accompanied by Mr. Vishwaksenan, from whom we gathered lot of information about sculptures, about temples, which period they pertain to, how chalukya's influence came about in later period sculptures, etc., etc., Thanks to Mr. Seetharaman, without whom we could not have dreamt of covering all the places we had planned to visit. Also Mr. Srinivasan & Mr. Seetharama Sharma, who came with us had very good historical knowledge that they shared with us.<br />When we were roaming around Periya Koil, Mr. Vishwaksenan told us about how people in early days used one kind of lamp to lighten the places. A particular variety of Fish's eyes, Muthu (pearl), Sea weed and some other thing were mixed together (there is no detail as to how to mix them all, at what temparature etc.,) and make the mixture into a lamp shape. they then keep that lamp in sunlight for few hrs and then tie it with a cloth. when taken out at night, the thing will shine like a mercury lamp through out the night. We know that people in earlier days had lots of knowledge, but sad that those discoveries were not properly documented.<br />What about ajantha paintings? they had drawn those paintings more than 1,000 years ago and the paintings still exist. What mooligais did they use? Do anyone have any idea as to how they were able to make those paintings. They have built great temples and forts and maaligais. Can anyone even dream of building similar structures now, even with all the modern devices we have now. How would they have taken those huge heavy weight stones to the top of the structures? They were real genius.<br />We cannot rebuild a thanjavur koil or gangai konda cholapuram or make such beautiful sculptures or azhiyaa varnam konda paintings. But what we can do is protect whatever exists and make people realize the importance of our ancient cultural heritage.<br />I felt very sad seeing some of those sculptures and paintings spoiled by some miscreants. Names had been written over the paintings in the tanjore temple. Those ignorant people probably thought that their names are more important than those paintings.<br />In other places all those kalvettus were hidden under cement surfaces. In the name of renovation they had spoiled or hidden the important masterpieces.<br />We all as a group should definitely strive to preserve our heritage.<br />Regards,<br />Poonguzhali (Lavanya)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Do you Yahoo!?<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi Sreeram,<br />I have read <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> n number of times and clearly remember those writings about Ajantha paintings. Anyway thanks for your mail, since everytime anything about <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is referred to I feel very happy.<br />Anyways, my point was that we need to preserve all those treasures. We need to do something soon.<br />Probably when time permits we can as a group visit those temples one by one and do some proper thirupani.<br />Poonguzhali<br />Sreeram Krishnamoorthy  wrote:Poonguzhali,<br /><br />I remember in S.S kalki has written about those<br />azhiyatha chithirangal in the last volume.
