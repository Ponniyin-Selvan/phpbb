			<div class="content">On Poorva Dedam...<br /><br />In "Kadal Pura" of Saandilyan's.. After, the great Karunaakara Thondaimaan entered the heart of Kaanchana Devi. There is a dialogue between Karunaakaran, Kaanchana Devi and Gunavarman, the so said king of Sri Vijaya Saamraajaya.<br /><br />There comes a discussion on reasons why Sri Vijaya is called Swarnabhumi, Poorva desam...etc..<br /><br />I don't remember the exact words as I am out of my city now. I am sorry.<br /><br />Relating it to Rajendhra's Kadaaram conquest, this might be true. As Rajendhra's intentions was to gain victory until Ganges. He might not have crossed it.<br /><br />But, as Kadal Pura, itself a imagionary story. I doubt its validity.<br /><br />On Mauryas expenditions..<br /><br />From: the book, 'Chaanakyanum Chadraguptanum' by ( some ). Iyer<br /><br />It seems during the times of Bindhusaara, th son of Great Chandragupta Maurya, there was a great famine and our Chera, Chola,Pandya..gave them the food and refused to get anything in return. And hence it was promised that they will not invade Tamizh Naadu.<br /><br />But, I have also read, I dont remember the book name, that all the three great kings of Tamil Naadu, joined together, to check Ashoka's invasions.<br /><br />Rajendhra Cholan!<br /><br /><br />"S.Gokul"  wrote:<br /><br />Dear SPS alias SB / Mr.Srihari /all<br /><br />Could you pl include "saanthimath theevu" - also mentioned in<br />rajendra's meikeerthi - as a place for discussion apart from poorva<br />desam ?<br /><br />People have been saying like "yet another island in arabian sea"<br />etc - but I think it has got more to it.<br /><br />Anbudan<br />G<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi to all,<br /><br />Its really great to get so much information from the learned lot.<br />Thanks a lot to Sri Hari, SPS and others who share their wealth of<br />knowledge with the group. More such informations will enlighten the<br />group members. Thanks a lot for your service rendered.<br /><br />While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that, in<br />the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except the<br />europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu was<br />never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the whole<br />of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to come<br />till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably<br />the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to<br />come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country<br />through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.<br /><br />Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great in<br />sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the chola<br />kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is many<br />of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.<br /><br />I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due respect<br />the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and wanted<br />to show their supremacy. Alexander is called 'The Great' all over the<br />world.

But<br />while he was capturing Hyderabad, shajahan was planning to give the<br />throne to the elder brother of Aurangazeb ( who was suppose to be a<br />diplomat than a warrior). Aurangazeb felt betrayed bcos of that<br />decision ( since he was one who was responsible for widening the<br />kingdom). So he stopped his plan and went back to delhi and arrested<br />his father and become the ruler. After that he concentrated on<br />consolidating the existing areas. fortunately none of his sons were<br />efficient to implement his vision ( As Rajendra did for his father).<br /><br />Also some respects goes to the great Vijayanagar Kingdom in preventing<br />any invasion from north towards south.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />K2.</div>

More such informations will enlighten<br />  the<br />    group members. Thanks a lot for your service rendered.<br />   <br />    While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that,<br />  in<br />    the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except<br />  the<br />    europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />    story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu<br />  was<br />    never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the<br />  whole<br />    of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />    enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to<br />  come<br />    till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably<br />    the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to<br />    come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country<br />    through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.<br />   <br />    Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great<br />  in<br />    sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />    seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the<br />  chola<br />    kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />    outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is<br />  many<br />    of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.<br />   <br />    I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due<br />  respect<br />    the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />    westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and<br />  wanted<br />    to show their supremacy. Alexander is called &#39;The Great&#39; all over<br />  the<br />    world. But he was almost defeated by an Indian<br />  King &#39;Purushotaman&#39;.<br />    Thats why Alexander made friendship with him and returned without<br />    further conquering. But this is not highlighted inthe world<br />    History.IF Alexander is called great, then Ashoka should also be<br />    called &#39;The Great&#39; and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> sh ould also be called &#39;The<br />  Great&#39;.<br />    In India alone, Ashoka is called the Great, but even in India <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />  and<br />    <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> are not called as the great. This disparity shown by the<br />    northerners towards southerners is heart breaking.<br />   <br />    What can be done to bring such things to the lime light? Why<br />  doesnt<br />    the so called &#39;Tamil saviours&#39; the DK&#39;s and the DMK&#39;s talk about<br />    these facts...any inputs from the learned people?

			<div class="content">Dear SPS,<br /><br />That was a splendid thought to say that lets not worry about global<br />acceptance, but feel proud about our own culture and tradition. Hats<br />off sir. I like that spirit. But still as I said and Niranjan ponted<br />out, even our own Indians and tamils of <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym>/Matric does not know<br />about the glory.That really pains. But I like to take it up in the<br />positive note as yours.<br /><br />Niranjan,<br />I too studied in a Matric school -:). But ofcourse there are<br />exceptions. I agree that students of matric and <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym> do not read<br />about our glory. The problme is with our educational system. When the<br />student cant understand anything, at the early classes the Ancient<br />History is taught. And following the chronological order, the start<br />with the ancient history in the class IV or V and by the time the<br />reach std. 9 and 10, when the student can analyse and understand<br />things, only Mughal India and British India are taught. So at last<br />the student remembers only the mughal India and British India and<br />forget the past glory. It would be better, if the education dept. can<br />change the syllubus as every class reads about everything starting<br />with small capsules in the early classes and eloborating as they rise<br />above. This surely will help students to remember the entire history<br />of India. Again these are not in our hands. -:)<br /><br />And Niranjan, we cannot say that during the periods mentioned by<br />Priya, Tamil was in the Dark. Probably if you meant to say Tamil Nadu<br />was in the dark, then i think its correct to some extent. But if you<br />say Tamil itself was in the dark then I deny that.<br />Manickavasar, i think, belongs to 15th century. Kumaraguruparar lived<br />in the 17th century and its said that hearing his discourse on Kamba<br />Ramayanam, TulasiDas got inspired and wrote "Ram Charita Manas" in<br />Hindi.He wrote 'Kandar Kalivenba' at the age of 5. Arunagirinathar's<br />period was around 250 years earlier from now.vallalar Ramalinga<br />adigalar lived a century ago. This is a limited list. There were<br />people in all ages who contributed to Tamil literature. And<br />Barathiyar took it to the masses. Again there is a misconception that<br />Bharatiyars tamil is very easy and anyone who knows tamil can<br />understand his poems. Bharathiyar himself has said that his poems are<br />easy to understand by anyone who has READ Tamil for around 3 years.<br />In those days READING for 3 years means becoming atleast a half<br />scholar(I mean the standards of education and we should realise that<br />our ancient learning methods were hearsay and very tough). Bharatiyar<br />was the last poet to write 'Marabillakiyam' meaning sticking to the<br />grammer of Tamil(Marbu or Yappu). To some extent Bharadidasan follwed<br />him. So Tamil was never in the dark at anytime. Probably,'yes' now.<br /><br />Priya,<br />Just not now, but even in your earlier mails, I cant stop wondering<br />the abundant Historical Knowledge you possess. Thats really great on<br />your part. How and where did you manage to read all these? Thanks for<br />your information.That was really great.Share more with us Priya.<br /><br />I have a doubt for quite a long time. Can anyone tell me what are the<br />present countries which our ancient history points to ..like Kadaram,<br />Savakam (I th ink its Java islands) manipallavam etc..in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and other<br />articles I have read about these countries across seas but do not<br />know which country they are. can anyone clarify?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>
