			<div class="content">*Bharati Subramania* ( 1882-1921)<br /><br />Subramania Bharati was born on 11 December 1882 at Ettayapuram in the<br />Tirunelveli District. His father Chinnaswamy Iyer was a learned Brahmin<br />attached to the Ettayapuram Zamin. He was also interested in Western<br />technology and managed to install the first textile mill at Ettayapuram in<br />1880. Bharati lost his mother when he was hardly five but found in his<br />stepmother affection and love. He was a precocious child and became a Tamil<br />scholar at a very early age. He was awarded the title of 'Bharati' for<br />successfully taking part in literary contest sponsored by the Raja of<br />Ettayapuram.<br /><br />After a few years of reluctant schooling in Tirunelveli, he joined the Zamin<br />service in 1897.The same year he was married to Chellammal. The sudden death<br />of Iyer in 1898 left him rudderless; he went to Banaras where his aunt<br />Kuppammal gave him shelter. He passed the Entrance examination of the<br />Allahabad University. Though he returned to Ettayapuram, Bharati was not<br />happy in the decadent, strife-ridden society of the Raja's palace. He took<br />up a temporary teaching post in Tamil at Madurai Setupati High School and<br />later joined theTamil daily Swadesa Mithran.<br /><br />The new job took him to Madras. His major work in the office was to<br />translate into Tamil news appearing in English dailies. This job gave him a<br />taste for politics and social reform. His passion-swathed patriotic poems<br />thrilled the entire Tamil Nadu and enthused the people to take part in<br />direct action. During these days,he met Sister Nivedita who blessed his<br />political involvement and zeal for the emancipation of women.<br /><br />Bharati was closely associated with the Extremist movement in the<br />Congress.To escape police persecution he retired to Pondicherry in1908. Here<br />he spent ten years writing brilliant poetry and prose. Tired with an exile's<br />life, he returned to British India. He was promptly arrested but released at<br />the instant of his well wishers. He rejoined his desk at the Swadesa Mithran<br />office but died in 1921 after being hit by the temple elephant at<br />Triplicane.<br /><br />Though Bharati was involved in active policies throughout his life and spent<br />his time in spirit-consuming journalism, he has left behind considerable<br />body of brilliant poetry. His poems can be divided into four categories: <br />Patriotic Poems, Devotional Songs ; Miscellaneous Poems ; Three Great Poems.<br /><br />*Patriotic Poems :* Bharati who loved Shelley's tireless search for<br />individual liberty was influenced by him while writing patriotic poetry. He<br />caught the breathless attention of the Tamil people with his powerful lyric,<br />the bulk of which are to be found in ' Swadesa Gitangal ' (1908) and ' Janma<br />Bhumi ' (1909). Significantly he dedicated both the books to Sisters<br />Nivedita.<br /><br />Abjuring mere political propaganda he gave a spiritual dimension to the<br />Indian thirst for freedom. He approached his task from three directions ; an<br />incantatory review of India, detailing its physical and spiritual rareness ;<br />an injection of the ideal of ' freedom ' into every person so as to banish<br />fear ; an evocation of the lives of the great men of India as living<br />examples for emulation.<br /><br />*Devotional Songs:* Bharati was a deeply religious man but had no patience<br />with obscurantism. The prayer songs dedicated to the embodied manifestations<br />of the University Deity are very popular today. His knowledge hymns repeat<br />the Vedantic search for universality. His autobiographical fragments too<br />come under this category. They are ' A Dream ' and ' Bharati : Sixty-Six '.<br />The most significant group is formed by his poems on Shakti. Bharti's ishta<br />devta was Shakti, the primordial power that makes and unmakes the whole<br />universe<br /><br />The Kali worship he witnessed at Banaras his meeting with Sister Nivedita,<br />the powerful poem ' Vande Mataram ' indicated by Bankim -all influence his<br />Shakti songs. His approach is personal and approximates to the Mother -Child<br />relationship. Her many aspects are caught within the area of his poetic<br />creation. ' Oozhi-k-koothu 'is the most audaciously frenzied and most<br />poetically articulate piece in the Bharati canon .It is a description of the<br />Mother's terrible dance of destruction which is at last arresed by the<br />advent of Shiva in his auspicious form, and they unite to recreate the<br />worlds once again.<br /><br />*Miscellaneous Poems:* The subject matter of these lyrics is social reform.<br />Even &quot; Puthia Athisoodi &quot; which is apparently meant for children has<br />commitments such as ' Curse Astrology', 'Learn Astronomy' and ' Modernise<br />ancient scriptures '. Many of the poems deal with nature, education and the<br />dignity of labour. Much of his nature poetry is contain in 'Vachana Kavithai<br />'. The emancipation of women excercised Bharati's mind greatly. He<br />visualised The ' New Woman ' as an emanation of Shakti. A willing helpmate<br />of man to build a new earth through co-operative endeavour.<br /><br />*Three Great Poems :* ( 1 ) ' Kannan Pattu ' Consists of twenty-three lyrics<br />published in 1917.Bharati ecstatically sang of Krishna as a friend , mother<br />, servant , teacher , student ,king ,child, prankish boy ,lover ,lady-love<br />and deity. The nayaka-nayaki bhava of Indian ecstatics is given a novel<br />twist by Bharati whose intense absorption in Krishna gives this superb<br />collection a unique place in Tamil literature.<br /><br />(2) The first part of 'Panchali Sapatham 'appeared in 1912 and the second<br />part twelve years later. Bharati's epic concentrates on the critical<br />movement when Duhshasana rises to disorobe Draupadi. By choosing this moment<br />and linking it to the earlier motivation of Duryodhana and the later series<br />of 'vows' by the Pandavas that seal his fate, Bharati created an<br />architecturally perfect poem that has both the epic sweep and the intensity<br />of tragic drama. The epic consists of five cantos. For the first time a long<br />Tamil poem was written with &quot;simple phrases, simple style, easily understood<br />prosody, rhythms liked by the common man&quot;.<br /><br />Bharati's ideas on social reform, anxiety to rid India of its foreign rulers<br />and devotion to Mahashakti also find a place in the movement of the epic.<br />The insulted and injured Queen, womanhood fighting for her due place in the<br />world of men, Mother India struggling to be free, and Mahashakti in the<br />plenitude of her splendour: these four attributes merge in that immortal<br />character turning from men to God at the centre of the Kuru court.<br /><br />(3) &quot;Kuyil Pattu' is a narrative poem and tells a fable about an Indian<br />nightingale, a bull and a monkey. The human characters are a prince and a<br />poet. The story came to the poet in a dream, a kind of vision of Beauty and<br />love. The fable could be interpreted in many ways. Chiefly, the poem seems<br />to point out the impossibility of a divine love on earth. Inevitably the<br />mundane earth tarnishes and kills such true love. The poem initiated a new<br />trend in Tamil poetry.<br /><br />Bharati wrote short stories and an unfinished novel, 'Chandrikayin Kathai'.<br />His 'wisdom tales', in imitation of 'Panchatantra' and 'Hitopadesa' stories,<br />are still popular in Tamil Nadu. Bharati also wrote in English and these<br />writings have been collected in 'Agni and Other Poems and Translations'<br />(1937) and 'Essays and other Prose Fragments' (1937).<br /><br />Subramania Bharati is now fully acknowledged as the father of modern Tamil<br />style. He showed the Tamilians that that the spoken rhythms of the language<br />can be easily transferred to the written page. It would be no exaggeration<br />to say that creative writing in Tamil during the last five decades owes its<br />existence to Bharati. Above everything else, he was one of the earliest to<br />speak of India as an entity. In his poems and prose writing he stressed the<br />need for an integrated India as an entity. In his poems and prose writings<br />he stressed the need for an integrated India and exhorted the Indians to<br />eschew regional rivalries and think in terms of an 'Indian'.<br /><br />Poem after poem describes the best in each region and how these should be<br />brought together to build a glorious future for India. He was sure that when<br />the call came, India's millions would answer with one voice. So he sang of<br />Mother Bharat at the dawn of our Independence Movement: <br />&quot;She has thirty crores of faces,<br />But her heart is one;<br />She speaks eighteen languages,<br />Yet her mind is one&quot;.<br /><br />His message for national unity is still relevant for our life times.<br /><br />Author : Prema Nandakumar<br /><br /><br /><br />Sardar A.Vedaratnam Pillai of Vedaraniam<br /><br /><br /><br />Vedaratnam Pillai was born on 25th February 1897 in Vedaraniam to salt<br />merchants Appakutty Pillai and Thangam Aachi. He was younger of the two<br />children for his parents. He belonged to the *Saiva* (vegetarian) Pillai<br />community that had a long tradition both of composing Tamil poetry about<br />Lord Shiva and serving and managing Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu.<br /><br />As a young man growing up in a pious and a patriotic family, Vedaratnam<br />Pillai was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, and Rajaji.<br />He liked their ideas and joined India's Freedom Struggle as a teenager. He<br />followed the teachings of Gandhiji and made cotton clothes for himself and<br />requested that everyone in his family wear only *Khadi* (pure cotton). He<br />eagerly participated in the boycott of foreign cloth, called<br />*Swadehsi*(from ones own nation) movement<br />* *(supporting materials made locally as opposed to made abroad). With the<br />blessings and help from his older brother, young Vedaratnam devoted a lot of<br />time in the Freedom Struggle, was arrested several times and spent several<br />months in prison. In 1930 when Gandhiji started his now famous salt<br />*Satyagraha<br />*(non-violent; strong belief in truth) March to Dandi in Gujarat, Vedaratnam<br />Pillai and Rajaji carried out the march in Vedaraniam, first of its kind in<br />South India putting himself and his family at risk. Because of this<br />Vedaratnam Pillai had to face the anger of the British Government which made<br />him pay triple the damages: a fine, time in jail, and confiscated his land<br />and property.<br /><br />In 1931, he attended the meeting of the agriculturists in Tamil Nadu where<br />he was given the title of *Sardar* (a commander) in recognition of his<br />participation in the freedom struggle, particularly the Salt* Satyagraha*.<br />In 1942, when Rajaji and other freedom fighters were arrested by the<br />British, Mr. Vedaratnam Pillai made sure Gandiji's teachings and programs<br />were kept alive and well. Following the death of Kasthurba Gandhi (wife of<br />Mahatma Gandhi) in 1944, he went around and requested funds for several<br />Women's and Children's Welfare Centers. In 1946, he founded the Kasthurba<br />Gandhi Kanya Gurukulam in Vedaraniam, a residential school with free<br />boarding and lodging for poor girls. For his service in the field of<br />untouchable's (*Harijhan*) welfare, he was awarded a gold medal by the<br />Madras (now Tamil Nadu) Government. He was elected three times as a Member<br />of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Madras State (now Tamil Nadu). He<br />donated all his MLA salary to Shri Ramakrishna Mission. He passed away on<br />August 24, 1961 due to an heart ailment while still attending the Madras<br />Assembly. The Gurukulam which he founded for the purpose of women's<br />betterment carries on its mission of educating young and unprivileged girls<br />even today. He was a nationalist and was opposed regionalism, and advocated<br />the study of Hindi as the unifying language, despite the fact that he was<br />fond of Tamil. The Indian Department of Posts issued a special<br />commemorative postage stamp, which you can see here, in the memory of him to<br />mark his 101st birth day.<br /><br />*ROLE OF TAMILNADU IN THE FREEDOM STRUGGLE*<br /><br />* *<br /><br />*MODERATES, EXTREMISTS AND GANDHIAN PERIOD*<br /><br />Tamilnadu played a vital role in the Indian freedom movement. Many leaders<br />have shed their life for the cause of our freedom. Because of their<br />sacrifice we got liberation and freedom from the British rule.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Rise of Nationalism: *The nineteenth century witnessed the socioreligious<br />reform movements. The rise of nationalism took its deep root in Tamilnadu.<br />During that period, Swami Vivekananda stayed at Chennai and delivered his<br />patriotic speeches. It kindled the spirit of the people to a greater extent.<br />Raja of Ramnad helped Swami Vivekananda for his voyage to Chicago. His<br />speech at Chicago was very famous. He loved and encouraged the youth of<br />Tamilnadu. The press, particularly The Hindu, Swadesamitran and Desabakthan<br />played a significant role in awakening the people. Means of transport like<br />railways helped the Nationalists to carry their ideas even to the remote<br />places of Tamilnadu.<br /><br /><br /><br />In order to rise the prestige of Tamil people the Madras Native Association<br />was founded in 1852. The grievances of the people were submitted to the<br />British Government. Madras Mahajana Sabha was established in 1884.<br />G.Subramaniya Iyer, P.Anandacharlu, Rangaiya Naidu played a significant part<br />in the association to redress the miseries of the people.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Rise of Indian National Congress*: The Indian National Congress was founded<br />by A.O.Hume in 1885. With the formation of Indian National Congress in 1885,<br />the freedom movement gained momentum in Tamilnadu. The first conference of<br />the congress was held at Bombay under the presidentship of W.C.Banerji.<br />C.Vijayaraghavachariyar of Salem, a close associate of A.O. Hume, was one of<br />the members of the committee which drafted the constitution of Indian<br />National<br /><br />Congress. G.Subramaniya Iyer of Chennai participated and moved a resolution<br />in the congress. In the beginning, the role of the Indian National Congress<br />was not to oppose the British government, but to submit their grievances in<br />a peaceful way. The sessions of Indian National Congress were convened at<br />Madras in 1887, 1895 and 1898. C.Vijayaraghavachariyar took a prominent role<br />in framing the rules of the congress during these years. During the early<br />phase of the congress,<br /><br />V.O.Chidambaram Pillai led the people of Tamilnadu in the Independent<br />struggle. He started the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company at Tuticorin. He<br /><br />vehemently opposed the British imperialism To honour his service and<br />sacrifice he was given the title Kappalottiya Tamizhan<br /><br /><br /><br />*Surat** Congress: *The Indian National Congress was held at Surat in the<br />year 1907. In this session ,Congress got split into extremists and<br />moderates. The extremists were led by Balagangadhar Tilak. *Swaraj is my<br />birth right' is the famous slogan of Balagangadhar Tilak.*<br /><br />* *<br /><br />*Rise of Extremism: *Balagangadhar Tilak was supported by V.O.Chidambaram<br />Pillai and Subramaniya Siva. They were called the Lieutenant's of Tilak and<br />they chanted the Mantra *'Vande Mataram'. *In Tuticorin, V.O.Chidambaram<br />Pillai and Subramaniya Siva protested against the British administration. In<br />1908 the mill workers of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin struck work, Ashe the Sub<br />Collector of Tirunelveli, fired into the crowd. The leaders who supported<br />the workers were arrested and imprisoned at Coimbatore and Salem<br />respectively.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Extremist activities: *Ashe was murdered in 1911 at Maniachi Railway<br />station by Vanchi Iyer, one of the patriots of Tamilnadu. Then, he shot<br />himself dead. The writings of Bharathi, the national poet kindled the<br />patriotic spirit of the people of Tamilnadu. V.V.S.Iyer started a Gurukulam<br />at Cheranmadevi to give training to the extremists.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Home rule movement: *It was started by Dr.Annie Besant in 1916. She induced<br />the people through her patriotic ideas. She delivered her *37 *speeches at<br />Marina and Luz in Chennai. Her writings and speeches helped the freedom<br />fighters to achieve their goals. S.Subramaniya Iyer, Thiru V. Kalyana<br />Sundaranar and Dr.Varadarajulu Naidu and E.V.Ramasamy Naicker helped her to<br />promote the Home Rule ideas. C.Vijayaraghavachariyar, Thiru V.Kalyana<br />Sundaranar,<br /><br />Varadharajulu Naidu, E.V.Ramasamy Naickear, S.Srinivasa Iyangar,<br />Sathyamurthy and K.Kamaraj were the leaders of the moderates. They played a<br />vital role in the freedom movement of Tamilnadu.<br /><br />*Dr.Annie Besant*<br /><br />*Dr. Annie Besant started 'Common Wheel'*<br /><br />*and 'New India' newspapers .*<br /><br />**<br /><br />*The period from 1920-47 is called the era of Gandhiji in the history of*<br /><br />*Indian National Movement.*<br /><br />* *<br /><br />*Non Co-operation Movement: *The people of Tamilnadu were angry with the<br />British Government because of the Rowlatt Act and Jallianwala Bagh tragedy<br />which occurred in 1919. Gandhiji moved the Non Co-operation resolution at<br />Nagpur Congress session. It was presided by C.Vijayaraghava Chariyar,<br />eminent Nationalist of Tamilnadu. Rajaji acted as the Lieutenent of<br />Gandhiji. He along with Sathyamurthy and E.V.Ramaswamy Naicker led the non<br />co-operation movement.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Events of the non co-operation movement: *Rajaji was arrested and<br />imprisoned in Vellore jail. Agitations occurred in different places. The<br />leaders and the people boycotted the courts and the government offices. When<br />the Prince of Wales visited Madras in 1921,his visit was boycotted by the<br />congress leaders like Rajaji and Periyar. Agitations infront of toddy and<br />arrack shops were held in various places of Tamilnadu.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Boycott of Simmon commission: *Under the leadership of Sathyamurthy Simon<br />commission was boycotted because there was no Indian member in it. In 1927,<br />the congress volunteers organised a Satyagraha for the removal of the Statue<br />of Colonel Neill (a tyrant of the 1857 Rebellion) errected at Madras. Many<br />were arrested. Yet the statue was broken. The statue was removed and kept in<br />the museum in 1937 when Rajaji became the premier of Madras.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Civil Disobedience Movement*<br /><br />* *<br /><br />*Salt Satyagraha: *on March 1930, Gandhiji violated the salt laws at Dandi.<br />Simulataneously, in Tamilnadu Rajaji violated the salt laws at Vedaranyam .<br />From Trichi nearly 100 patriots headed by Rajaji marched to Vedaranyam.<br />Leaders like Sardar Vedharatanam Pillai, T.S.S.Rajan, Srimathi Ruckmani<br />Lakshmipathy took part in this salt satyagraha. It created awareness among<br />the people against the British Government.<br /><br /><br /><br />Many people like Rajaji, K.Kamaraj were arrested when they disobeyed the<br />British government . *&quot;No Tax Campaign&quot; *was also conducted in many parts of<br />Tamilnadu. At Tirupur on 11th January 1932 the police attacked a procession<br />carrying National flags and singing national songs . As a result of the<br />lathi charge, Tirupur Kumaran, a freedom fighter sacrificed his life. He<br />demonstrated his patriotism by firmly holding the congress flag and shouting<br />Vande Mataram against the British. It was a deed of patriotism, heroism and<br />symbol of dedication.<br /><br />*Tirupur Kumaran is popularly known as Kodikatha Kumaran*<br /><br />As per the directions of Gandhiji individual satyagraha was followed by the<br />leaders of Tamilnadu. Many young leaders like Adikeasava Naicker, Salem Adi<br />Narayana chettiar, Guruswamy naidu, K.Kamaraj, Omandoor Ramasamy Reddiar,<br />Baktavatsalam, C.Subramaniyam and R.Venkatraman participated in the freedom<br />movement.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Quit India movement: *The resolution of Quit India movement was passed at<br />Bombay congress session in 1942. On the advice of Gandhiji many leaders like<br />K.Kamaraj participated in the movement. Leaders like Muthuranga Mudaliar,<br />Baktavatsalam and R.Venkataraman were arrested. Disturbances spread all over<br />Tamilnadu in support of the freedom movement.<br /><br /><br /><br />In Madras the agitators led the procession . They raised 'Quit India'<br />slogans, observed hartals and burnt the public offices. The workers of<br />Buckingham and Carnatic Mills and Madras Port Trust struck work. In North<br />Arcot the disturbances were severe. The agitators cut off telegraphic and<br />telephone lines. They also burnt the public buildings at Vellore and<br />Panapakkam. In South Arcot there were similar outbreaks. In Chidambaram,<br />Annamalai University students went on strike. Many patriots were killed at<br />Rajapalayam, Karaikudi, Devakottai, Tiruvadanai and Poolankuruchi. The<br />British took severe actions against the agitators.<br /><br />* *<br /><br />*India** towards Independence *: The Cripps and Cabinet Mission visited<br />India, and studied the condition. The interim government headed by Nehru<br />assumed the office and Rajaji became the Home Minister of India in 1946.<br />Mountbatten plan was accepted. The Indian Independence Act was passed in the<br />British Parliament. India attained independence from the clutches of the<br />British on 15th August 1947 after the heroic struggle.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Satheesh kumar R</div>

But there are somany souls who sacrificed their entire life to the freedom circle from Tamilnadu. Generally these people are not highlighted even within Tamilnadu, atleast we the people of Tamil land try to know about themand remember them. <br />Vanchinathan (1886 - June 17, 1911) , popularly known as Vanchi, was an Indian independence activist. He is best remembered for having shot dead Ashe,the Collector of Thirunelveli and having later committed suicide in order to evade arrest.<br />Personal Life<br />Vanchinathan was born in 1886 in Shenkottai to Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani Ammal. His actual name was Shankaran. He did his schooling in Shenkottai and graduated in M.A. from Moolam Thirunal Maharaja College in Thiruvananthapuram. Even while in college, he married Ponnammal and got into a lucrative Government job.<br />Freedom Movement<br />On June 17, 1911, Vanchi assassinated Ashe, the district collector of Tirunelveli, who was also known as Collector Dorai. He shot Ashe at point-blank range when Ashe's train had stopped at the Maniyachi station, en route to Madras. He committed suicide thereafter. The railway station has since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.<br />Vanchi was a close collaborator of Varahaneri Venkatesa Subrahmanya Iyer (normally shortened to V.V.S.Aiyar or Va.Ve.Su Iyer), another freedom fighterwho sought arms to defeat the British.<br />Vanchinathan's letter<br />I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone responsible for this. <br />3000 youths of this brave country have taken an oath before mother Kali to send King George to hell once he sets his foot on our motherland. I will kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of King George in this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to makethem understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this sacred land. I, as the youngest of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe who is his sole representative and has destroyed the Swadeshi shipping company and several other freedom fighters by subjecting them to severe torture.<br />Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram<br />Theeran Chinnamalai, a lesser-known freedom fighter of Kongu soil By Karthik Madhavan<br />Tamil calendar Aadi 18, which is August 2, 2008, marks the 203rd anniversary of the hanging of a lesser-known freedom fighter Dheeran Chinnamalai. According to historian Pulavar S. Raju, Dheeran Chinnamalai was the first freedom fighter in history to make freedom struggle a people's movement. In therun up to his attack on British East India Company's fort in Coimbatore in1800, Chinnamalai tried taking the help of Maruthu brothers from Sivagangaand a Maratha chieftain in Mysore. He also forged alliances with Gopal Naicker of Virupatchi; Appachi Gounder of Paramathi,Velur; Joni Jon Khan of Attur, Salem; Kumara Vellai of Perundurai and Varanavasi of Erode in fightingthe Company. The plan was to attack the fort on June 3, 1800. Pulavar Rajusays Chinnamalai drew the plan to keep up the momentum in the fight against the Company after Kattabomman's and Tippu's death in 1798 and 1799 respectively. <br />Chinnamalai's plans did not succeed as the Company has stopped reinforcements from Maruthu brothers and the Maratha chieftain. Also, Chinnamalai changed his plans and attacked the fort a day earlier. This led to the Company army executing 49 people. Chinnamalai, however escaped.From 1800 to until hewas hanged on July 31, 1805, Chinnamalai continued to fight against the Company. The historian says he mostly adopted guerrilla warfare against the Company.Three of his fights are important: the 1801 battle on Cauvery banks,the 1802 fight in Odanilai and the 1804 battle in Arachalur. The last and the final one was in 1805. During the fight, Chinnamalai's cook Nallappan betrayed him by disclosing his location to Company sepoys, who hanged him todeath in Sivagiri fort. Pulavar Raju says his was the first fight against the British involving people. <br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai<br />To V.O. Chidambaram Pillai goes the credit of launching, as the first Indian, a Steam Navigation Company that ran a service between Tuticorin and Colombo. He did it in the interests of the nation's economy, and of course, against the British rule.<br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai came out of the Congress in 1920. <br />He was born on September 5, 1872 in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He had his education in Tuticorin and took a Degree in Law form Madras. <br />He presided over the Salem District Congress session. He entered politics in 1905 following the partition of Bengal. He was a great lover of Tamil andencouraged Tamil studies. He wrote a commentary on &quot;Tirukurral&quot; and editedthe Tamil work of grammar, Tolkappiam. He passed away on November 18, 1936<br />K. Kamaraj<br />Kamraj was born on July 15, 1903, in a family of traders at Virudunagar. His real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy Nadar but was affectionately shortenedto Raja by his mother, Sivakami Ammal. His father, Kumarswamy Nader, was acoconut merchant. Kamaraj was enrolled at the local elementary school, theNayanar Vidyalaya but was later shifted to the high school Kshatriya Vidyalaya. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Unfortunately his father died within a year of Kamaraj's enrollment in school. Kamaraj's mother sold all jewelry except her earrings and deposited themoney with a local merchant and cared for the entire family on the monthlyinterest that the money earned.<br />Kamaraj was not a good student in school and dropped out when he was in thesixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his periods of imprisonment and even learned English from his co-worker. <br />Kamaraj joined as an apprentice in his maternal uncle Karuppiah's cloth shop after dropping out of school. He would slip out from the shop to join processions and attend public meetings addressed by orators like Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph. His relatives frowned upon Kamaraj 's budding interest in politics. They sent him to Thiruvananthapuram to work at another uncle's timer shop. Even there Kamaraj participated in the Vaikom Satyagraha led by George Joseph, of the Congress, against the atrocities of the higher caste Hindus on the Harijans. His elders had him called back home and pressured him to marry. Kamaraj resolutely refused to bow to the dictates of his elders. <br />At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the Congress. He participated in inviting speakers, organizing meetings and collecting funds for the party. He also participated in the march to Vedaranyam ledby Rajagopalachari as part of the Salt Satyagraha of March 1930. <br />Kamaraj was arrested and sent to Alipore Jail for two years. He was twenty seven at the time of arrest and was released in 1931 following the Gandhi-Iriwn Pact. Kamaraj was implicated in the Virudhunagar Bomb Case two years later. Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph argued on Kamaraj's behalf and proved the charges to be baseless. Kamaraj was arrested again in 1940 and sent to Vellore Jail while he was on his way to Wardha to get Gandhiji's approval for a list of satyagrahis.Â  <br />While still in jail, Kamaraj was elected Chairman to the Municipal Council.Nine months later upon his release, Kamaraj went straight to the Municipality and tendered his resignation from his post. He felt that &quot;one should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice.&quot; <br />Kamaraj was arrested once more in 1942 and sentenced to three years in the Amaravathi prison for spreading propaganda material for Quit India movementinitiated by Gandhiji. While in prison, Kamaraj read books and continued his self-education. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Kamaraj's political guru and inspiration was S. Satyamurti, orator and parliamentarian. Satyamurti found in Kamaraj &quot;an efficient, loyal, indefatigable worker and skillful organizer (p. 147, Pakshirajan) .&quot; Both developed a deep friendship and complemented each others' skills. In 1936, Satyamurti was elected President of the Provincial Congress and he appointed Kamaraj theGeneral Secretary. Four years later they swapped positions. The party basewas strengthened under their leadership. So deep was Kamaraj's devotion for Satyamurti that when India gained independence, he first went to Satyamurti's house and hoisted the Indian flag there. On his election as Chief Minister, Kamaraj went to Satyamurti's house and garlanded his photo and paid his respects to the leader's widow.<br />On April 13, 1954, K. Kamaraj reluctantly became the Chief Minister of Madras. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and M. Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet. Kamaraj gave simple advice to his ministers, &quot;Face the problem. Don't evade it. Find a solution, however small... . People will be satisfied if you do something.&quot; The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education upto eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meals Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor children. He introducedfree school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class distinctions amongyoung minds. <br />Under Kamaraj's administration, a number of irrigation schemes were completed in record time. The Land Ceiling Act and the Tenancy Protection Act benefited small farmers and saved them from being exploited by landlords. Medium and small scale industries prospered in the midst of large industries making Madras one of the leaders in industrialization. Nehru complimented Kamaraj for making Madras (later renamed State of Tamil Nadu) the best administered State in India.&quot; <br />Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for three consecutive terms. On October 2, 1963, he resigned to serve a greater purpose. Kamaraj noticed that the Congress party was slowly losing its vigor . He came up with a plan which was called the &quot;Kamaraj Plan.&quot; He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign form their posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the Congress. A number of Central and State ministers like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai and S.K. Patil followed suite and resigned from their posts. In 1964, Kamaraj was elected the President of the All India Congress and he successfully navigated the nation through the stormy years following Nehru's death. <br />On October 2, 1975, Gandhi Jayanti, Kamaraj awoke from his afternoon nap feeling uneasy. His housekeeper, Vairavan, rang up his physician. While he was on his way out, Kamaraj said, &quot;Vairavan, put out the lights when you go out.&quot; K. Kamaraj died that day. He was honored with the highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1976.<br />S.Satyamurti<br />Satyamurti was born on August 19, 1887 in Tirumayyan village, in the principality of Pudukottai, now part of Tamil Nadu. His father, Surendur Sastriar, an orthodox brahmin, scholar, and pleader by profession, died leaving hiswife, children and aged parents to fend for themselves. Satyamurti was theeldest of the five sons and one of nine children. It fell to him and his mother to care for the family. <br />He joined the Christian College, Madras in 1906 for his Bachelors of Arts Course. He was one of the most brilliant students and secured a first class in English and second class in Sanskrit and History. While he diligently pursued his studies, he was greatly influenced by the freedom struggle. He described his college year as &quot;exciting times.&quot;<br />Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born in Tirutani on September 5, 1888 into a poor brahmin family. His father Sarvepalli Veeraswami was employed on a meagre salary in the zamindari. His mother's name was Sitamma. It was difficultfor Radhakrishnan's father to educate him with a meagre income and a largefamily to take care of.Â  <br />Radhakrishnan went through most of his education on scholarships. He initially went to school in Tirutani and then to the Lutheran Mission School in Tirupati for his high school. He joined the Voorhee's College in Vellore butswitched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He chose philosophy as his major and attained a B.A. and M.A. in the field. He was afraid that his M.A. thesis, &quot;The Ethics of the Vedanta&quot; would offend his philosophy professor, Dr. A.G. Hogg. Instead, Dr. Hogg commended Radhakrishnan on doing an excellent job. Radhakrishnan's M.A. thesis was published when he was only 20<br />Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamuamma at the age of 16 while still in Vellore. Radhakrishnan accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the Madras Presidency College in 1909. While at the College, he mastered the classics of Hindu philosophy, namely the Upanishads, Bhagvad Gita, Brahmasutra, and commentaries of Sankara, Ramunuja and Madhava. He also acquainted himself with Buddhist and Jain philosophy. At the same time he read philosophical commentaries of Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Bradley, and Bergson. Later on in his life,he studied Marxism and Existentialism.Â  <br />In 1914, in a strange twist of fate, Radhakrishnan met Srinivasa Ramanujan,the mathematical genius. Srinivasa was leaving for Cambridge for studies and had come to seek Radhakrishnan's blessings because a goddess came in hisdream and told him to do so before undertaking the trip. The two never metagain.Â  <br />In 1918, Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore. By the time, Radhakrishnan had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He completed his first book &quot;The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore.&quot; He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the &quot;genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit.&quot; Radhakrishnan's second book, &quot;The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy&quot; was published in 1920.Â  <br />Radhakrishnan's books and articles, drew the attention of Ashutosh Mookerjee, Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University. He nominated Radhakrishnan to the prestigious George V Professor of Philosophy at the Calcutta University, 1921. In 1923, Dr. Radhakrishnan's &quot;Indian Philosophy&quot; was published. The book was in response to the request made by Prof. J. H. Muirhead, to write abook on Indian philosophy for the Library of Philosophy. Radhakrishnan accomplished this mammoth task by producing a systematic and readable account of Indian philosophy. The book was hailed as a &quot;philosophical classic and aliterary masterpiece.&quot;Â  <br />Radhakrishnan was called to Oxford University, England, to deliver the prestigious &quot;Upton Lectures&quot; on &quot;The Hindu View of Life.&quot; The lectures were followed by an invitation to head the Department of Comparative Religion at Oxford. A philanthropist, Spalding, created a professorship for Radhakrishnanto teach Religion and Ethics at Oxford.Â  <br />Radhakrishnan used his lectures as a platform to further India's cause for freedom. He thundered, &quot;India is not a subject to be administered but a nation seeking its soul.&quot; He would graphically describe the &quot;shame of subjection and the lines of sorrow&quot; apparent on every Indian's face.Â  <br />In 1931, Radhakrishnan was elected Vice Chancellor of the Andhra University.. The University was in a state of stagnation. Radhakrishnan restructured the Honors and Post- Graduate teaching in Humanities and Languages, and Science and Technology Departments from scratch. By the time he left in 1936, he had transformed the University into a robust and well-recognized institution.Â  <br />In 1939, Radhakrishnan became the Vice Chancellor of the Benaras Hindu University, Uttar Pradesh, founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. The University was under pressure from the Governor, Sir Maurice Hallet, to turn the campus into a war hospital in response to the Quit India Movement launched by Gandhiji and the Congress. Radhakrishnan rushed to Delhi and successfully persuaded the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, to halt the Governor's action. The Governor instead suspended financial support to the University. Radhakrishnan went on &quot;a Begging Pilgrimage,&quot; to collect funds from sympathizers and philanthropists. When Malaviyaji retired from University work completely, the Benaras Hindu University requested Radhakrishnan's services for an indefinite period which Radhakrishnan acquiesced to.Â <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Â <br />After independence on August 15, 1947, Radhakrishnan was requested to Chairthe University Education Commission in 1948. The Radhakrishnan Committee'ssuggestions helped mould the education system for India's needs.Â  <br />In 1949, Dr. Radhakrishnan was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union. The appointment raised many eyebrows because people wondered what kind of an impression Radhakrishnan, a student of idealist philosophy, would make on Joseph Stalin, an ardent communist. In 1950, Radhakrishnan was called to theKremlin to meet with the Premier. This was rather irregular. Radhakrishnanwas accompanied by Indian Embassy Minister, Rajeshwar Dayal and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and interpreter Pavlov. Radhakrishnan told Stalin, &quot;We had an emperor in India who, after bloody victory, renounced warand became a monk. You have waded your way to power through force. Who knows that might happen to you also.&quot; Radhakrishnan was referring to Stalin's infamous &quot;bloody&quot; purges. Stalin smiled and replied, &quot;Yes, miracles do happen sometimes. I was in a theological seminary for five years!&quot;Â  <br />On April 5, 1952, a few days before Radhakrishnan's departure for India, Stalin called on Radhakrishnan. Radhakrishnan records Stalin's face being bloated. Radhakrishnan patted him on the cheek and on the back. Stalin said, &quot;You are the first person to treat me as a human being and not as a monster.You are leaving us and I am sad. I want you to live long. I have not long to live.&quot; Stalin died six months later. Radhakrishnan's legacy in Moscow was a firm and friendly understanding between India and the Soviet Union. A relationship which has flourished over the years and has become even stronger.Â  <br />Radhakrishnan was elected Vice-President of India in 1952. The Vice-President presides over the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) sessions, much like the Speaker does in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). Often, during a heated debate, Radhakrishnan would intervene with slokas from the sanskrit classics or quotations from the Bible to calm the charged atmosphere. Nehru commented later, &quot;By the way in which Radhakrishnan conducted the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha, he had made the meetings of the House look like family gatherings!&quot;Â  <br />Dr. Radhakrishnan was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1954. Around the same time, an 883-page compilation titled &quot;The Philosophy of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan&quot; was released in America.Â  <br />In 1956, Radhakrishnan's devoted wife, Sivakamuamma, passed away after sharing 50 years of married life. The couple had five daughters and a son.Â  <br />After serving two terms as Vice-President, Radhakrishnan was elected President of India in 1962. Radhakrishnan's tenure as President was marked by thedisastrous Indo-China war of 1962, his state visit to the United States in1963, the end of the Nehru-era with Nehru's death in 1964, and India's victorious performance against Pakistan in 1965 under Lal Bahadur Shastri. Radhakrishnan guided each of the Prime Ministers wisely and helped see India through those trying years safely. Radhakrishnan refused to continue for another term as President after his term ended in 1967.Â  <br />At the age of 79, Dr. Radhakrishnan returned to Madras in May 1967 to a warm homecoming. He spent his last years happily at his house &quot;Girija&quot; in Mylapore, Madras.Â  <br />Dr. Radhakrishnan died on April 17, 1975.<br />Â Courtesy: Wiki &amp; some websites<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R<br />Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  <br />Â <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage.

			<div class="content">Dear Satish, thank you for the wonderful, inspiring summary with so <br />many forgotten souls!! In coimbatore there was a flower market named <br />after Thiruppur Kumaran - beleive it or not lot of people thought he <br />was a 'javuli vyabaaari', since Thiruppur is known for textiles. Such <br />is the level of ignorance in our country.<br /><br />Thiru Menatchi, your passion is admirable. But a small suggestion, <br />try to say something positive and give it in small doses. If I <br />address green house effect, Darfur rapes, Iraq war and the economy in <br />one email nobody will understand. Just as an example - my father <br />mentioned few days ago that he felt the Hindu newspaper was <br />increasingly becoming pro China and he wanted to stop reading it. An <br />elderly man of 75+ who had grown up on this newspaper to say that was <br />remarkable. I read on Muthu's blog again that he felt same about the <br />Hindu's stance on Dalai Lama protests. If I were to say anything I <br />would say it like that - what I can do about it.Vaai valikka <br />thittuvadhai vida very effective. Siru thuli peru vellam.<br />Hope i have not opened a pandora box. <br /><br />Bests<br /><br />Malathi</div>

Every 5 years bring a chance to change the Govt.Â  We have toÂ choose betweenÂ ' Erigira kolliyil endha kolli nalla kolli?' only.<br />Â Â Â Â Â  But belief is the basement of life. Hope this will change definitely. It will take two or three generations to change this. <br />Â Â Â Â Â  Let us teach our children to be honest and straightforward. Or atleast make them to think. Coming generations are more smart, more intelligent, more practical.Â  Learning history makes to feel 'how great were our Kings, our people, how great were the govts. how great were our justice'.
