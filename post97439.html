			<div class="content">Thanks Vijaya Kumar for an interesting & detailed analysis.

If<br />the government increases its spending, then the citizens are<br />encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation.<br />People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb back up<br />to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after 15<br />years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />something...or was it a compromise formula reached between <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and<br />Uttama.<br /><br />3) <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was war hungry - short<br />tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />manipulated <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have no<br />love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his horoscope).<br /><br />Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> will be next<br />in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back when<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> came on....<br /><br />my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th year<br />of uc rule, which made <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> take over - since they were royality, he<br />was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to him -<br />we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice then) ...<br />after a year <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> went after the rest.<br /><br />but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding witch -<br />with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and<br />infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />reasoning behind the kollivai peei...<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Shobha Ramakrishnan<br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Balakumaran&#39;s Udayar gives a version that Sembiyan Maadevi was<br />behind the plot to kill <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>&#39;s brother though who actually killed is a?<br /> <br /> <br />  sivaram Kannan wrote:<br />    hey......<br />    who killed <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>&#39;s brother???<br /> <br />  that&#39;s an question that&#39;s never gonna be answered by anyone -:&#41;<br />  What is your take in it????<br /> <br /> <br />  ever tried. ever failed. no matter.<br />  try again. fail again. fail better.<br />  -- Samuel Beckett<br /> <br />  Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com<br />  Journal: sivaramsk.livejournal.com<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Yahoo!
