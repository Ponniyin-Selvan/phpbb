			<div class="content">Dear Friends,<br /><br />When we talk about independence we immediately think about Gandhi and Nehru.<br />But there are somany souls who sacrificed their entire life to the freedom<br />circle from Tamilnadu. Generally these people are not highlighted even<br />within Tamilnadu, atleast we the people of Tamil land try to know about them<br />and remember them.<br /><br />*Vanchinathan* (1886 - June 17, 1911) , popularly known as Vanchi, was an<br />Indian independence activist. He is best remembered for having shot dead<br />Ashe, the Collector of Thirunelveli and having later committed suicide in<br />order to evade arrest.<br />*Personal Life*<br /><br />Vanchinathan was born in 1886 in Shenkottai to Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani<br />Ammal. His actual name was Shankaran. He did his schooling in Shenkottai and<br />graduated in M.A. from Moolam Thirunal Maharaja College in<br />Thiruvananthapuram. Even while in college, he married Ponnammal and got into<br />a lucrative Government job.<br />*Freedom Movement*<br /><br />On June 17, 1911, Vanchi assassinated Ashe, the district collector of<br />Tirunelveli, who was also known as Collector Dorai. He shot Ashe at<br />point-blank range when Ashe's train had stopped at the Maniyachi station, en<br />route to Madras. He committed suicide thereafter. The railway station has<br />since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.<br /><br />Vanchi was a close collaborator of Varahaneri Venkatesa Subrahmanya Iyer<br />(normally shortened to V.V.S.Aiyar or Va.Ve.Su Iyer), another freedom<br />fighter who sought arms to defeat the British.<br />*Vanchinathan's letter*<br /><br />I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone<br />responsible for this.<br /><br />3000 youths of this brave country have taken an oath before mother Kali to<br />send King George to hell once he sets his foot on our motherland. I will<br />kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of King George in<br />this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to make<br />them understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this<br />sacred land. I, as the youngest of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe<br />who is his sole representative and has destroyed the Swadeshi shipping<br />company and several other freedom fighters by subjecting them to severe<br />torture.<br /><br />Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram<br /><br />*Theeran Chinnamalai**, a lesser-known freedom fighter of Kongu soil<br />*ByKarthik Madhavan<br /><br />Tamil calendar Aadi 18, which is August 2, 2008, marks the 203rd anniversary<br />of the hanging of a lesser-known freedom fighter Dheeran Chinnamalai.<br />According to historian Pulavar S. Raju, Dheeran Chinnamalai was the first<br />freedom fighter in history to make freedom struggle a people's movement. In<br />the run up to his attack on British East India Company's fort in Coimbatore<br />in 1800, Chinnamalai tried taking the help of Maruthu brothers from<br />Sivaganga and a Maratha chieftain in Mysore. He also forged alliances with<br />Gopal Naicker of Virupatchi; Appachi Gounder of Paramathi,Velur; Joni Jon<br />Khan of Attur, Salem; Kumara Vellai of Perundurai and Varanavasi of Erode in<br />fighting the Company. The plan was to attack the fort on June 3, 1800.<br />Pulavar Raju says Chinnamalai drew the plan to keep up the momentum in the<br />fight against the Company after Kattabomman's and Tippu's death in 1798 and<br />1799 respectively.<br /><br />Chinnamalai's plans did not succeed as the Company has stopped<br />reinforcements from Maruthu brothers and the Maratha chieftain. Also,<br />Chinnamalai changed his plans and attacked the fort a day earlier. This led<br />to the Company army executing 49 people. Chinnamalai, however escaped.From<br />1800 to until he was hanged on July 31, 1805, Chinnamalai continued to fight<br />against the Company. The historian says he mostly adopted guerrilla warfare<br />against the Company.Three of his fights are important: the 1801 battle on<br />Cauvery banks, the 1802 fight in Odanilai and the 1804 battle in Arachalur.<br />The last and the final one was in 1805. During the fight, Chinnamalai's cook<br />Nallappan betrayed him by disclosing his location to Company sepoys, who<br />hanged him to death in Sivagiri fort. Pulavar Raju says his was the first<br />fight against the British involving people.<br /><br />*V.O. Chidambaram Pillai*<br /><br />To V.O. Chidambaram Pillai goes the credit of launching, as the first<br />Indian, a Steam Navigation Company that ran a service between Tuticorin and<br />Colombo. He did it in the interests of the nation's economy, and of course,<br />against the British rule.**<br /><br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai came out of the Congress in 1920.<br /><br />He was born on September 5, 1872 in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He<br />had his education in Tuticorin and took a Degree in Law form Madras.<br /><br />He presided over the Salem District Congress session. He entered politics in<br />1905 following the partition of Bengal. He was a great lover of Tamil and<br />encouraged Tamil studies. He wrote a commentary on &quot;Tirukurral&quot; and edited<br />the Tamil work of grammar, Tolkappiam. He passed away on November 18, 1936<br /><br />*K. Kamaraj*<br /><br />Kamraj was born on July 15, 1903, in a family of traders at Virudunagar. His<br />real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy Nadar but was affectionately shortened to<br />Raja by his mother, Sivakami Ammal. His father, Kumarswamy Nader, was a<br />coconut merchant. Kamaraj was enrolled at the local elementary school, the<br />Nayanar Vidyalaya but was later shifted to the high school Kshatriya<br />Vidyalaya.<br /><br />Unfortunately his father died within a year of Kamaraj's enrollment in<br />school. Kamaraj's mother sold all jewelry except her earrings and deposited<br />the money with a local merchant and cared for the entire family on the<br />monthly interest that the money earned.<br /><br />Kamaraj was not a good student in school and dropped out when he was in the<br />sixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and<br />realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his<br />periods of imprisonment and even learned English from his co-worker.<br /><br />Kamaraj joined as an apprentice in his maternal uncle Karuppiah's cloth shop<br />after dropping out of school. He would slip out from the shop to join<br />processions and attend public meetings addressed by orators like Dr.<br />Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph. His relatives frowned upon Kamaraj 's<br />budding interest in politics. They sent him to Thiruvananthapuram to work at<br />another uncle's timer shop. Even there Kamaraj participated in the Vaikom<br />Satyagraha led by George Joseph, of the Congress, against the atrocities of<br />the higher caste Hindus on the Harijans. His elders had him called back home<br />and pressured him to marry. Kamaraj resolutely refused to bow to the<br />dictates of his elders.<br /><br />At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the<br />Congress. He participated in inviting speakers, organizing meetings and<br />collecting funds for the party. He also participated in the march to<br />Vedaranyam led by Rajagopalachari as part of the Salt Satyagraha of March<br />1930.<br /><br />Kamaraj was arrested and sent to Alipore Jail for two years. He was twenty<br />seven at the time of arrest and was released in 1931 following the<br />Gandhi-Iriwn Pact. Kamaraj was implicated in the Virudhunagar Bomb Case two<br />years later. Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph argued on Kamaraj's<br />behalf and proved the charges to be baseless. Kamaraj was arrested again in<br />1940 and sent to Vellore Jail while he was on his way to Wardha to get<br />Gandhiji's approval for a list of satyagrahis.<br /><br />While still in jail, Kamaraj was elected Chairman to the Municipal Council.<br />Nine months later upon his release, Kamaraj went straight to the<br />Municipality and tendered his resignation from his post. He felt that &quot;one<br />should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice.&quot;<br /><br />Kamaraj was arrested once more in 1942 and sentenced to three years in the<br />Amaravathi prison for spreading propaganda material for Quit India movement<br />initiated by Gandhiji. While in prison, Kamaraj read books and continued his<br />self-education.<br /><br />Kamaraj's political guru and inspiration was S. Satyamurti, orator and<br />parliamentarian. Satyamurti found in Kamaraj &quot;an efficient, loyal,<br />indefatigable worker and skillful organizer (p. 147, Pakshirajan).&quot; Both<br />developed a deep friendship and complemented each others' skills. In 1936,<br />Satyamurti was elected President of the Provincial Congress and he appointed<br />Kamaraj the General Secretary. Four years later they swapped positions. The<br />party base was strengthened under their leadership. So deep was Kamaraj's<br />devotion for Satyamurti that when India gained independence, he first went<br />to Satyamurti's house and hoisted the Indian flag there. On his election as<br />Chief Minister, Kamaraj went to Satyamurti's house and garlanded his photo<br />and paid his respects to the leader's widow.<br /><br />On April 13, 1954, K. Kamaraj reluctantly became the Chief Minister of<br />Madras. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and M.<br />Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed<br />cabinet. Kamaraj gave simple advice to his ministers, &quot;Face the problem.<br />Don't evade it. Find a solution, however small... . People will be satisfied<br />if you do something.&quot; The State made immense strides in education and trade.<br />New schools were opened, better facilities were added to existing ones. No<br />village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high<br />school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and<br />compulsory education upto eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meals<br />Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor children.<br />He introduced free school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class<br />distinctions among young minds.<br /><br />Under Kamaraj's administration, a number of irrigation schemes were<br />completed in record time. The Land Ceiling Act and the Tenancy Protection<br />Act benefited small farmers and saved them from being exploited by<br />landlords. Medium and small scale industries prospered in the midst of large<br />industries making Madras one of the leaders in industrialization. Nehru<br />complimented Kamaraj for making Madras (later renamed State of Tamil Nadu)<br />the best administered State in India.&quot;<br /><br />Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for three consecutive terms. On October 2,<br />1963, he resigned to serve a greater purpose. Kamaraj noticed that the<br />Congress party was slowly losing its vigor . He came up with a plan which<br />was called the &quot;Kamaraj Plan.&quot; He proposed that all senior Congress leaders<br />should resign form their posts and devote all their energy to the<br />re-vitalization of the Congress. A number of Central and State ministers<br />like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai and S.K. Patil<br />followed suite and resigned from their posts. In 1964, Kamaraj was elected<br />the President of the All India Congress and he successfully navigated the<br />nation through the stormy years following Nehru's death.<br /><br />On October 2, 1975, Gandhi Jayanti, Kamaraj awoke from his afternoon nap<br />feeling uneasy. His housekeeper, Vairavan, rang up his physician. While he<br />was on his way out, Kamaraj said, &quot;Vairavan, put out the lights when you go<br />out.&quot; K. Kamaraj died that day. He was honored with the highest civilian<br />honor, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1976.<br /><br />S.Satyamurti<br /><br />Satyamurti was born on August 19, 1887 in Tirumayyan village, in the<br />principality of Pudukottai, now part of Tamil Nadu. His father, Surendur<br />Sastriar, an orthodox brahmin, scholar, and pleader by profession, died<br />leaving his wife, children and aged parents to fend for themselves.<br />Satyamurti was the eldest of the five sons and one of nine children. It fell<br />to him and his mother to care for the family.<br /><br />He joined the Christian College, Madras in 1906 for his Bachelors of Arts<br />Course. He was one of the most brilliant students and secured a first class<br />in English and second class in Sanskrit and History. While he diligently<br />pursued his studies, he was greatly influenced by the freedom struggle. He<br />described his college year as &quot;exciting times.&quot;<br /><br />*Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan* was born in Tirutani on September 5, 1888 into a<br />poor brahmin family. His father Sarvepalli Veeraswami was employed on a<br />meagre salary in the zamindari. His mother's name was Sitamma. It was<br />difficult for Radhakrishnan's father to educate him with a meagre income and<br />a large family to take care of.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan went through most of his education on scholarships. He<br />initially went to school in Tirutani and then to the Lutheran Mission School<br />in Tirupati for his high school. He joined the Voorhee's College in Vellore<br />but switched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He chose<br />philosophy as his major and attained a B.A. and M.A. in the field. He was<br />afraid that his M.A. thesis, &quot;The Ethics of the Vedanta&quot; would offend his<br />philosophy professor, Dr. A.G. Hogg. Instead, Dr. Hogg commended<br />Radhakrishnan on doing an excellent job. Radhakrishnan's M.A. thesis was<br />published when he was only 20<br /><br />Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamuamma at the age of 16 while still in<br />Vellore. Radhakrishnan accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the Madras<br />Presidency College in 1909. While at the College, he mastered the classics<br />of Hindu philosophy, namely the Upanishads, Bhagvad Gita, Brahmasutra, and<br />commentaries of Sankara, Ramunuja and Madhava. He also acquainted himself<br />with Buddhist and Jain philosophy. At the same time he read philosophical<br />commentaries of Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Bradley, and Bergson. Later on in his<br />life, he studied Marxism and Existentialism.<br /><br />In 1914, in a strange twist of fate, Radhakrishnan met Srinivasa Ramanujan,<br />the mathematical genius. Srinivasa was leaving for Cambridge for studies and<br />had come to seek Radhakrishnan's blessings because a goddess came in his<br />dream and told him to do so before undertaking the trip. The two never met<br />again.<br /><br />In 1918, Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the<br />University of Mysore. By the time, Radhakrishnan had written many articles<br />for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the<br />International Journal of Ethics. He completed his first book &quot;The Philosophy<br />of Rabindranath Tagore.&quot; He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the &quot;genuine<br />manifestation of the Indian spirit.&quot; Radhakrishnan's second book, &quot;The Reign<br />of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy&quot; was published in 1920.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan's books and articles, drew the attention of Ashutosh<br />Mookerjee, Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University. He nominated<br />Radhakrishnan to the prestigious George V Professor of Philosophy at the<br />Calcutta University, 1921. In 1923, Dr. Radhakrishnan's &quot;Indian Philosophy&quot;<br />was published. The book was in response to the request made by Prof. J. H.<br />Muirhead, to write a book on Indian philosophy for the Library of<br />Philosophy. Radhakrishnan accomplished this mammoth task by producing a<br />systematic and readable account of Indian philosophy. The book was hailed as<br />a &quot;philosophical classic and a literary masterpiece.&quot;<br /><br />Radhakrishnan was called to Oxford University, England, to deliver the<br />prestigious &quot;Upton Lectures&quot; on &quot;The Hindu View of Life.&quot; The lectures were<br />followed by an invitation to head the Department of Comparative Religion at<br />Oxford. A philanthropist, Spalding, created a professorship for<br />Radhakrishnan to teach Religion and Ethics at Oxford.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan used his lectures as a platform to further India's cause for<br />freedom. He thundered, &quot;India is not a subject to be administered but a<br />nation seeking its soul.&quot; He would graphically describe the &quot;shame of<br />subjection and the lines of sorrow&quot; apparent on every Indian's face.<br /><br />In 1931, Radhakrishnan was elected Vice Chancellor of the Andhra University.<br />The University was in a state of stagnation. Radhakrishnan restructured the<br />Honors and Post- Graduate teaching in Humanities and Languages, and Science<br />and Technology Departments from scratch. By the time he left in 1936, he had<br />transformed the University into a robust and well-recognized institution.<br /><br />In 1939, Radhakrishnan became the Vice Chancellor of the Benaras Hindu<br />University, Uttar Pradesh, founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. The<br />University was under pressure from the Governor, Sir Maurice Hallet, to turn<br />the campus into a war hospital in response to the Quit India Movement<br />launched by Gandhiji and the Congress. Radhakrishnan rushed to Delhi and<br />successfully persuaded the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, to halt the Governor's<br />action. The Governor instead suspended financial support to the University.<br />Radhakrishnan went on &quot;a Begging Pilgrimage,&quot; to collect funds from<br />sympathizers and philanthropists. When Malaviyaji retired from University<br />work completely, the Benaras Hindu University requested Radhakrishnan's<br />services for an indefinite period which Radhakrishnan acquiesced to.<br /><br /><br /><br />After independence on August 15, 1947, Radhakrishnan was requested to Chair<br />the University Education Commission in 1948. The Radhakrishnan Committee's<br />suggestions helped mould the education system for India's needs.<br /><br />In 1949, Dr. Radhakrishnan was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union. The<br />appointment raised many eyebrows because people wondered what kind of an<br />impression Radhakrishnan, a student of idealist philosophy, would make on<br />Joseph Stalin, an ardent communist. In 1950, Radhakrishnan was called to the<br />Kremlin to meet with the Premier. This was rather irregular. Radhakrishnan<br />was accompanied by Indian Embassy Minister, Rajeshwar Dayal and Soviet<br />Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and interpreter Pavlov. Radhakrishnan told<br />Stalin, &quot;We had an emperor in India who, after bloody victory, renounced war<br />and became a monk. You have waded your way to power through force. Who knows<br />that might happen to you also.&quot; Radhakrishnan was referring to Stalin's<br />infamous &quot;bloody&quot; purges. Stalin smiled and replied, &quot;Yes, miracles do<br />happen sometimes. I was in a theological seminary for five years!&quot;<br /><br />On April 5, 1952, a few days before Radhakrishnan's departure for India,<br />Stalin called on Radhakrishnan. Radhakrishnan records Stalin's face being<br />bloated. Radhakrishnan patted him on the cheek and on the back. Stalin said,<br />&quot;You are the first person to treat me as a human being and not as a monster.<br />You are leaving us and I am sad. I want you to live long. I have not long to<br />live.&quot; Stalin died six months later. Radhakrishnan's legacy in Moscow was a<br />firm and friendly understanding between India and the Soviet Union. A<br />relationship which has flourished over the years and has become even<br />stronger.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan was elected Vice-President of India in 1952. The<br />Vice-President presides over the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) sessions, much<br />like the Speaker does in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). Often, during a heated<br />debate, Radhakrishnan would intervene with slokas from the sanskrit classics<br />or quotations from the Bible to calm the charged atmosphere. Nehru commented<br />later, &quot;By the way in which Radhakrishnan conducted the proceedings of the<br />Rajya Sabha, he had made the meetings of the House look like family<br />gatherings!&quot;<br /><br />Dr. Radhakrishnan was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1954. Around the same<br />time, an 883-page compilation titled &quot;The Philosophy of Dr. Sarvepalli<br />Radhakrishnan&quot; was released in America.<br /><br />In 1956, Radhakrishnan's devoted wife, Sivakamuamma, passed away after<br />sharing 50 years of married life. The couple had five daughters and a son.<br /><br />After serving two terms as Vice-President, Radhakrishnan was elected<br />President of India in 1962. Radhakrishnan's tenure as President was marked<br />by the disastrous Indo-China war of 1962, his state visit to the United<br />States in 1963, the end of the Nehru-era with Nehru's death in 1964, and<br />India's victorious performance against Pakistan in 1965 under Lal Bahadur<br />Shastri. Radhakrishnan guided each of the Prime Ministers wisely and helped<br />see India through those trying years safely. Radhakrishnan refused to<br />continue for another term as President after his term ended in 1967.<br /><br />At the age of 79, Dr. Radhakrishnan returned to Madras in May 1967 to a warm<br />homecoming. He spent his last years happily at his house &quot;Girija&quot; in<br />Mylapore, Madras.<br /><br />Dr. Radhakrishnan died on April 17, 1975.<br /><br />Courtesy: Wiki &amp; some websites<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Satheesh kumar R</div>
