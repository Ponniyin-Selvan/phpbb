			<div class="content">Hi Vijay,<br /><br />That's an interesting article. But too long to read patiently.. But<br />i did read those parts belonging to southindia and ceylon.<br /><br />One thing i found is that, these were essentially written by the<br />christian travellers, where in this article, they refer to them as<br />idoloators. There is possibility of one sided view of the european<br />travellers. (their mentioning of cowards!!!...)<br /><br />Any way, this cannot be rejected on the whole.<br /><br />Secondly, I could not get how this story fits our case.  <br /><br />But, there is lot of information from these discussions. The new<br />info, made me to again revisit my old opinions.<br /><br />Ultimately, the main difference i found b/w wars of our kings, and<br />that of the invaders is that, while it was a raja dharma, and widely<br />accepted one, of one country invading another.. But, the societal<br />setup was not disturbed by these wars, although, the warring class<br />suffered heavily.. (that too was an widely accepted, as the<br />characteristics of the kshatriyas.. )<br /><br />The main reference i bank on these is dharampal's books.  <br /><br />For example, Even during the worst period of mughals, the social setup<br />of ours were largely intact, with our pre-british educational<br />institutions, the various settlements all across the land, the typical<br />social setup, the educational process, where each village had basic<br />educational facilities etc.<br /><br />The common people were largely indifferent to the political<br />happenings. That's why, even when mughals dominated, our people<br />relented in and co-existed.<br /><br />As swamy vivekananda says, the only time, there was mass rebellion is<br />that, whenever there is large interference in the religious beliefs of<br />the common people.<br /><br />as i said in our earlier mails, the kingdom were conglomeration of<br />small rulers, who accepted a particular kings authority. The king<br />largely operate from his chosen bases like capital city and other<br />forts that he built.<br />The daily affairs were mostly taken care of the small kings.<br /><br />When another king invades and defeats the present king, then the small<br />rulers tend to accept the new king's authority, and pays tribute to him.<br /><br />When the mughals invaded, this is what exactly happened. They<br />initially set out for destruction of kafirs, but on seeing such vast<br />settlements of people, and the enormous wealth, coming as tribute from<br />numerous such small rulers, they retained the political setup, with<br />some customization on their part.<br /><br />They disloged many of the big kings.<br /><br />But, again, whenever, there is any anti-people policies, the local<br />rulers were sensitive to those, and they took side, to displace the<br />present king.<br />This happened during the moovendar eras also.. when pandiyan king is<br />not fair, the local rulers switched side to chola to dislodge him. <br />Because, they were directly accountable to the people then.<br /><br />It is this background, that when aurangazeb started large scale<br />demolition and conversion, the local rulers, joined together, and<br />fought back, and since the great sivaji was scoring at that time, they<br />rallied behind him.<br /><br />Its the same reason, that many of the tamil kings, rallied behind<br />vijayanagara empire, to fight against the muslim invaders.<br /><br />But, the greatest havoc is wrought by the britishers, who managed to<br />collapse the entire social order. They took over numerous endowments<br />to our indigneous educational institutions, temples, and other<br />institutions of arts, medicine etc. They replaced our political<br />setup, with their own. OUr local rulers were made dummy, and<br />subvertient to collectors.<br /><br />The absense of the local kings to enforce dharma, and association with<br />non-dharmic based britishers, led to degradation of many of the local<br />rulers.<br />This is where, you have pointed numerous leisure, and palace kings,<br />who doesnot cared about people. Because, there was no one to punish<br />them, for going against the people. For the britishers, they were<br />fine as long as they receive the agreed tribute. But, it was not the<br />case with indian rulers. The scholars in the society took the issue<br />to the king, and ensured that either the local chief is punished or<br />warned.<br /><br />This is what, i so far understood about our pre-british society, from<br />dharampal's book.<br /><br />So, i could confidently say, that the wars of the west, mostly based<br />on semitic religion, which believed in believers and non-believers, is<br />entirely different from the wars of india, which was purely a conflict<br />of kingdoms.<br /><br />There were virutes, like not attacking the unarmed, children, women,<br />etc. It was a moral code followed by almost all the kings.. And how<br />such virutes developed among all kingdoms is researchable.  <br /><br />From what i understood is, that the princes learned from the martial<br />institutions, and as they grow, they were taught to follow dharma.<br /><br />Its imperative, that we had our own treasure of administrative<br />policies, and there were scholars, who were proficient in it. Even in<br />wars, there were numerous tactics followed, which unfortunately were<br />undocumented and lost after britishers banned all forms of martial<br />practices in india.<br /><br /><br /><br />Reference: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dharampal.net">http://www.dharampal.net</a><!-- w --><br /><br />Regards,<br />Senthil Raja<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I remember reading a post in agathiar on marco polo account of <br />  pandya time.

It is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man&#39;s <br />  arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is <br />  quite free from flaw and as red as fire. Its value is so great that <br />  a price for it in money could hardly be named at all.

But the <br />  King replied that on no account whatever would he sell it, for it <br />  had come to him from his ancestors.[NOTE 5]<br />  <br />  The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures. <br />  And when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from <br />  foreign parts.</div></blockquote></div>

Because, there was no one to punish<br />  them, for going against the people. For the britishers, they were<br />  fine as long as they receive the agreed tribute.

But, the societal<br />    setup was not disturbed by these wars, although, the warring class<br />    suffered heavily.. &#40;that too was an widely accepted, as the<br />    characteristics of the kshatriyas.. &#41;<br />   <br />    The main reference i bank on these is dharampal&#39;s books.<br />   <br />    For example, Even during the worst period of mughals, the social setup<br />    of ours were largely intact, with our pre-british educational<br />    institutions, the various settlements all across the land, the typical<br />    social setup, the educational process, where each village had basic<br />    educational facilities etc.<br />   <br />    The common people were largely indifferent to the political<br />    happenings. That&#39;s why, even when mughals dominated, our people<br />    relented in and co-existed.<br />   <br />    As swamy vivekananda says, the only time, there was mass rebellion is<br />    that, whenever there is large interference in the religious beliefs of<br />    the common people.<br />   <br />    as i said in our earlier mails, the kingdom were conglomeration of<br />    small rulers, who accepted a particular kings authority. The king<br />    largely operate from his chosen bases like capital city and other<br />    forts that he built.<br />    The daily affairs were mostly taken care of the small kings.<br />   <br />    When another king invades and defeats the present king, then the small<br />    rulers tend to accept the new king&#39;s authority, and pays tribute<br />to him.<br />   <br />    When the mughals invaded, this is what exactly happened. They<br />    initially set out for destruction of kafirs, but on seeing such vast<br />    settlements of people, and the enormous wealth, coming as tribute from<br />    numerous such small rulers, they retained the political setup, with<br />    some customization on their part.<br />   <br />    They disloged many of the big kings.<br />   <br />    But, again, whenever, there is any anti-people policies, the local<br />    rulers were sensitive to those, and they took side, to displace the<br />    present king.<br />    This happened during the moovendar eras also.. when pandiyan king is<br />    not fair, the local rulers switched side to chola to dislodge him.<br />    Because, they were directly accountable to the people then.<br />   <br />    It is this background, that when aurangazeb started large scale<br />    demolition and conversion, the local rulers, joined together, and<br />    fought back, and since the great sivaji was scoring at that time, they<br />    rallied behind him.<br />   <br />    Its the same reason, that many of the tamil kings, rallied behind<br />    vijayanagara empire, to fight against the muslim invaders.<br />   <br />    But, the greatest havoc is wrought by the britishers, who managed to<br />    collapse the entire social order. They took over numerous endowments<br />    to our indigneous educational institutions, temples, and other<br />    institutions of arts, medicine etc. They replaced our political<br />    setup, with their own. OUr local rulers were made dummy, and<br />    subvertient to collectors.<br />   <br />    The absense of the local kings to enforce dharma, and association with<br />    non-dharmic based britishers, led to degradation of many of the local<br />    rulers.<br />    This is where, you have pointed numerous leisure, and palace kings,<br />    who doesnot cared about people. Because, there was no one to punish<br />    them, for going against the people. For the britishers, they were<br />    fine as long as they receive the agreed tribute. But, it was not the<br />    case with indian rulers. The scholars in the society took the issue<br />    to the king, and ensured that either the local chief is punished or<br />    warned.<br />   <br />    This is what, i so far understood about our pre-british society, from<br />    dharampal&#39;s book.<br />   <br />    So, i could confidently say, that the wars of the west, mostly based<br />    on semitic religion, which believed in believers and non-believers, is<br />    entirely different from the wars of india, which was purely a conflict<br />    of kingdoms.<br />   <br />    There were virutes, like not attacking the unarmed, children, women,<br />    etc. It was a moral code followed by almost all the kings.. And how<br />    such virutes developed among all kingdoms is researchable.<br />   <br />    From what i understood is, that the princes learned from the martial<br />    institutions, and as they grow, they were taught to follow dharma.<br />   <br />    Its imperative, that we had our own treasure of administrative<br />    policies, and there were scholars, who were proficient in it. Even in<br />    wars, there were numerous tactics followed, which unfortunately were<br />    undocumented and lost after britishers banned all forms of martial<br />    practices in india.<br />   <br />    Reference: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dharampal">http://www.dharampal</a><!-- w -->. net<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Senthil Raja<br />   <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />     <br />        I remember reading a post in agathiar on marco polo account of<br />      pandya time.

You must know that rubies are<br />      found in this Island and in no other country in the world but this.<br />      They find there also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and many<br />      other stones of price. And the King of this Island possesses a ruby<br />      which is the finest and biggest in the world; I will tell you what<br />      it is like. It is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man&#39;s<br />      arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is<br />      quite free from flaw and as red as fire. Its value is so great that<br />      a price for it in money could hardly be named at all. You must know<br />      that the Great Kaan sent an embassy and begged the King as a favour<br />      greatly desired by him to sell him this ruby, offering to give for<br />      it the ransom of a city, or in fact what the King would. But the<br />      King replied that on no account whatever would he sell it, for it<br />      had come to him from his ancestors.[NOTE 5]<br />     <br />      The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures.<br />      And when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from<br />      foreign parts.<br />     <br />   <br />    <br />  <br />  -- <br />  with luv & regards,<br />  siva<br />  <br />  ever tried. ever failed. no matter.<br />  try again. fail again. fail better.<br />  -- Samuel Beckett<br />  <br />  Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot. com<br />  Journal: sivaramsk.livejourn al.com</div></blockquote></div>
