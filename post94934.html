			<div class="content">Dear Kamal,<br /><br />I am in agreement with you..<br /><br />Re Periyar EVR, even Rajaji and Mahaswamigal criticised only (Hindu)<br />Kadavul maruppu Iyakkam ... Other social reformations were need of the era.<br />Not that others did not care for reformations .. He was able to and<br />highlight also.. Rajram Mohan Roy, Thilakar and like, carried forward in<br />other parts of India ...<br /><br />Incidentally, Arignar Anna has written more on Periyar marrying Maniammai ..<br />DMK was formed because of this single issue. DK never became the political<br />party.. it confined as a social reforming outfit..<br /><br />There is difference in approach between Anna and Kalaignar ..<br />But what all of them had in common was : Before they criticised anything,<br />they went into the strengths of the Movement / Object which was<br />criticised ...<br /><br />Those who were criticised, were not defending properly or could not<br />defend... (for lack of knowldge in their own faith)...<br /><br />Recently when Ramagopalan presented Bagavath Gita to Kalaignar, he also<br />presented a review of Gita from the DK perspective written by<br />Dr.Veeramani...<br /><br />How many of us have really read the materials of those whom we are<br />criticising now .... ? I do not want to get into such quick sand without<br />proper armoury ... and the platform ... different ..<br /><br /><br />Re descedents of Chozhas, about eight years back a Wedding Invitation of a<br />Mannargudi Family proclaimed them as descedents of " Perumbidugu<br />Mutharayas.. " .....<br /><br /><br />fondly, sps</div>

			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />Its nice to share views and learn things, clarify our views etc.<br />Initially when I joined<br />this group a month back, I was quizzed a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> because only a couple of<br />the members were writing. Now many have joined and pouring in their<br />thoughts and I am happy that I am able to learn more daily and<br />clarify things. As I wrote yesterday, only if we share our thoughts<br />we can enrich our knowledge. It would be even great if others also<br />start writing, because around 15 members out of 475...do you think<br />its a good response....come on friends, shed your inhibitions and<br />speak out. We have knowledgable people over here who can clarify our<br />doubts, thoughts and views. Only thing which grows by sharing, is<br />Knowledge.<br /><br />GOod debate of cholas, EVR etc. Yes there are goods and bads in all.<br />Even I am not perfect, neither the others.I am not protesting anyone<br />or supporting anyone. Thought I have put a full stop yesterday<br />itself, but today i found many more mails. As a last mail on this<br />topic, I wish to share something. No one is totally right and no one<br />is totally wrong here. We are just sharing our views and hope the<br />maturity level is always high. No ones intention is to hurt others,<br />right...<br /><br />Re.EVR, I am not touching much on this topic, because I have not read<br />much about his activities.All news I have are hearsay. But good that<br />everyone accepts that he has gone to extremes, which he could have<br />avoided. Yes the social reforsm made by him are highly comendable and<br />we should admit that.<br /><br />Re true history creating hatred...I think vijay wrote on this. Yes<br />what you said is correct. Saying that so and so destroyed so many<br />temples, etc. surely creates hatred. I am not saying that these<br />should be taught at school. Its pity that when we say reading<br />history, it is confined only to school text books. What we read in<br />school is not the end of History..I think everyone will accept this<br />point. If that is so, then our group looses its purpose. why are we<br />discussing history here if we learn everything at school?<br /><br />I only say that, when we talk about the greatness of only the muslim<br />rulers in our text book, the greatness of Hindu rulers should also be<br />inclued. I already wrote earlier that the syllubus starts with<br />ancient India at the 1st standard and ends with British India at<br />10std. So the students remember only the Moghul and British India and<br />no one knows about the greatness of other heros like <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>, <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> or<br />Ashoka. As I said,the picture is painted as if the arts and<br />architecture flourished only during the Moghul rule. we all know its<br />not entirely true. Every king has contributed wisely for such purpose<br />and due respect should be given to them all. When you say Shah Jahan<br />built Taj Mahal, also tell that the Great <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> built the Big Temple.<br />Ofcourse its said, but not as detailed as Taj Mahal.Right..From: this<br />group we all know how powerful the Chola Navy was. <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> was able to<br />cris cross the Bay of Bengal humpteen number of times to capture the<br />countries overseas, which no Muslim Rulers have done. Why this is not<br />highlighted in the Indian History, where as Aurangzebs conquest till<br />Afghanistan alone is trumpeted.Its politics History to apease the<br />minorities.<br /><br />Coming to the point of hatred..as you said, reading such things at a<br />mature age will do no harm. But its not available to the masses. If a<br />Ayodhya excavation occurs, if the US satellite shows Saraswathi river<br />bed, why dont the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> or the great historians probe and try to find<br />out the truth, instead of sticking to the old history told by the<br />westerners? If we think talking the truth will create hatered, then<br />the country will never live in peace.<br />Take the instance of Nazis homicide of the Jews. Even after 60 years,<br />everynow and then, the holocaust is remembered and reverberated<br />throughout the world. Everyday its discussed somewhere in the world.<br />Exhibitions are held to show the sufferings of the victims of the<br />Holocaust. Every single person who died in the gas chamber is a<br />hero/heroine. Their names are highlighted now and then. World class<br />magazines write about a simple person who died in the holocaust. Does<br />this create hatred against the Germans? No country or no community<br />has hatred against the Germans today. The Jews remember the holocaust<br />and showcause the world only becase, they dont want the fact to be<br />forgotten and no such Incident should occur in the furute. They dont<br />have a feeling of hatred against the Germans. On the other hand,<br />Germans remember the holocaust every now and then, because they<br />repent for what has been done and wanted to remind the world that<br />such things should not happen again. They have a sense of guilt which<br />they repent for. Jews and German are not fighting and killing each<br />other after the Holocaust.<br /><br />But what happens in India..The Hindu Holocaust is much more higher<br />than the Jews holocaust. Then why no exhibition is conducted to<br />showcause that. Outside India, why even within India no one knows<br />this fact. Atrocities against the Hindus in kashmir valley and the<br />Islamic militancy is always on the rise only because like the<br />Germans, they dont have the sense of Guilt. Its not their fault.<br />Germans feel guilty because the Jews highlight the fact and the whole<br />world accepts it. Where as in India no one highlights the fact and so<br />there is no full stop to violence. Graham Stains and his sons..three<br />christian lives hold dear to all the politicians, but not even a<br />single politician or organisation in Inida,except Jayalalitha,<br />protested and condemned the Godhra Train carnage where 59 Hindus were<br />chared to death. Unless one community realises and repents for their<br />fault, there can be no peace. It holds good for Hindus, Christians or<br />muslims. But this doesnt happen in India. Whatever happen, the Hindus<br />are at the receivng end. If backlashing the upper caste and<br />sidelining them saying that in older days the uppercaste suppressed<br />the lower caste, and giving utmost attention to the lower caste is<br />justified (ofcourse its justfied and acceptable by all) then the same<br />holds good for stopping the Islamic fanatics by saying the fact that<br />Hindus have been suppressed for 10 decades. Why no one talks about<br />that? Because its votebank politics. This is what I mean by unbiased<br />open History.This will and can never happen in India.<br /><br />'History Repeats Itself', but some history should not repeat itself<br />for which the unbiased History is a must. The main reason for Hindu<br />muslim divide in India, as far as I am concerned, the supression of<br />the facts. The north Indians have much more hatred against Muslims<br />than the south Indians. The riots mostly take place in North rather<br />than south. Why? Have anyone given a thought on this...because it was<br />they who have sufferred at the muslim hands for centuries while the<br />impact in the south is very less. Inspite of that when the political<br />parties and the government tries to appease the Muslim in the name of<br />minorities,and project a picture that the muslims are not safe in the<br />hands of the hindus, the hindus get agitated. Again its well proved<br />in Gujarat riots. Do you think, such a thing would have happened, if<br />immediate after the train carnage, all the political parties<br />protested and condemened the act and immediate action was taken<br />against the culprits? Today our great railway minister has ordered<br />for a second probe..are these justified. As long as the culprit dont<br />feel guilty of their act, India can never live in Peace.<br /><br />History is the reflection of our culture. Its just like a mirror.<br />Unless we dont know how shappy we look, we cant clean ourselves and<br />for this unbiased History is a must. Thats what I mean to say.<br /><br />Again, we see in this group itself that, when something wrong is said<br />about something, even without proper knowledge, there are many<br />comments saying, its the result of reading biased writings. But<br />whatever is being said and written about the uppercaste hindus, do<br />you think that its all unbiased. Only the attrocities done by them<br />are highlighted, and the too many goods done by them are suppressed.<br />Is it not biased writing? Why no one voice out for that?<br /><br />Sorry for deviating the topic of the group. I said I am putting a<br />fullstop, yesterday itself, but things dont happen as we think. I am<br />just sharing my views with the group and I have no hatred, but<br />only 'adhangam' that our country is going to ruins. Hope you all will<br />understand my thought.<br /><br />I know I am blunt at many instance, but thats my nature, weakness and<br />strength. Again I tell you, I write my views only to get more clarity<br />on what I think or feel. I dont claim whatever I say is correct. So<br />any criticism is most welcome so that I can enrich myself.<br /><br />Sorry once again if I have written anything wrong. I am not for any<br />further discussion on this. Lets put a fullstop here, because its a<br />never ending topic. I need be we can create a seperate group for<br />this. hahah... just kidding. Lets get back to our business.<br /><br />What about our Trip? I think if poeple let know the group about the<br />locations, then we can plan accordingly for aplace convinient to all,<br />so that the first trial trip becomes feasible.or if any place is ok<br />then I voice for Mahabalipuram. Any suggestions on how to proceed?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>
