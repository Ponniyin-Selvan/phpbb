			<div class="content">:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>sit in the dark and <br />wait for science to come up with something as absurd as Darwin&#39;s</div></blockquote>theory and obviously as always... ignorance can be bliss.<br /><br /><br />Hi<br />i dont think you can write off the evolution theory especially since <br />our religion offers the alternative of us arriving on terra firma  <br />from different parts of bramha's body<br />Dna tests are confirming that we are related to the monkeys. whether <br />they evolved from us or we evolved from them is another issue.<br />the closest living relatives of Homo sapiens are the two species of <br />chimpanzee: the Bonobo (Pan paniscus) and the Common Chimpanzee (Pan <br />troglodytes). Full genome sequencing resulted in the conclusion <br />that , 98.4% of the DNA sequence is identical between the two Pan <br />species and human.<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-- Ravi<br />  <br />  Muthu Prakash R  <br />wrote: I am not an evolutionaist but</div></blockquote>a guy who likes to look at things <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>unbiased and with a scientific perspective. And of course, as I <br />said <br />  earlier, I am not going to get into the meta-physical world and <br />  derive facts for me.<br />  Science operates in two modes. One is theory and other is <br />  experiment. While the theory is proposed, it has to be proven by <br />  experiment. While the General theory of Relativity talked about <br />the <br />  gravitaion, only the actual observation of the trasit of venus <br />  proved it. Scientific method by itself is rigourous, self-<br />corrective <br />  and critique-driven. That is why it appeals to me. <br />  What you call fantasy is something that was proposed as a theory <br />and <br />  years of observation of the phenomenon and experiments have <br />provided <br />  proof to the fact. Evolutionary theory, as explained by Darwin, <br />has <br />  changed a lot today, although the basis remains the same, and has <br />  evolved itself through the self-correcting process of experiments <br />  and observations. The only POV acceptable here is the relentless <br />  pursuit of truth however hard-hitting it may be.<br />  On the other hand, the concept of lemuria is often confused with <br />the <br />  continental plates theory and there is not one iota of proof and <br />  what we have is a theory propagated by the sangam poets about <br />  kingdoms thousands of years old and by dravidian politicians who <br />  used it in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s as a tool to drive forth the Tamil <br />  nationalism. No proofs. In fact, no one is interested in proof as <br />it <br />  may not validate their POV. Even today, there is a lot of <br />confusion <br />  on what is in and what is out of this theory. In fact, I even saw <br />a <br />  map of the lemuria with the cities and mountains mapped out. Who <br />is <br />  the geographer who mapped it? Can you formulate a decent theory of <br />  Lemuria, some of which can be proved beyond doubt? We talk <br />  about &#39;Pahruli&#39; river, mt.Meru and a great city called ThenMadurai <br />  with a decent amount of population submerged in he oceans between <br />  Cape Kumari and Madagaskar and Java. But where is a theory which <br />  says this is what Lemuria is and ready to correct itself when <br />  evidence is found? The resistance to scientific approach is usual <br />in <br />  cases of dogma in relation to religion or politics. Here it is <br />both. <br />  My request is that you want to be proud of this forgotten <br />  civilization, please do. But dont shove it saying it is a fact <br />  waiting to be discovered.<br />  Everything that is there in Earth leaves its footprint. Chola <br />  temples, however few they may be, still are examples that this <br />great <br />  dynasty existed. There are only a few pyramids left, for that <br />  matter. Or may be a few skyscrapers left in NY. I remember the <br />last <br />  shot of that classic Charles Heston movie &#39;Planet of the apes&#39; <br />where <br />  he discovers the footprint of NYC.<br />  And ofcourse, science will take thousand of years for solving <br />issues <br />  like this precisely because of the amount of religious/political <br />  dogma attached to it. It took 2000 years to prove that earth <br />  revolved around the sun, but then it took another 200 years for <br />  people to belive the same. <br />  About the link, not sure you read through it. It talks about the <br />  explosion of placental mammals&#40;like rodents&#41; at the end of the <br />  Paleocene age. It is a long way from there to Homo species and to <br />  Home Sapiens. As part of the mammals, we can say our fellow <br />mammals, <br />  some rat-like creatures roamed with Dinosaurs &#40;that too only if <br />you <br />  believe the evolutionary fantasy!&#41;. Nothing more. This is what <br />  happens when things get reported in a tabloid channel like Channel <br />  four. I would say they should stick to &#39;Big Brother&#39; and not <br />bother <br />  science.<br />   <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    From: an evolutionist point of view - what you can deem as <br />concrete <br />  evidence is what that meets the naked eye.

The <br />  proof may not be as easy to figure out as it looks via science, we <br />  are new borns when it comes to knowledge. The answers to many are <br />  not available in plain focussed science, only a mixture of data on <br />  science and religion has a chance to figure out the truth.

Dhanushkodi is another example. There is more to be <br />  discovered and having an open mind to theories may find a <br />derivative <br />  to our past.<br />    <br />    On Uthiramerur, how ever funny it may seem, as a humble learner, <br />I <br />  would like to know of any other reason on its name.<br />    <br />    We need answers for questions which science by its own takes <br />  thousands of years to figure out.  <br />    <br />    Thanks<br />    Ravi<br />    <br />    Muthu Prakash R  <br />  wrote: Let me make one thing <br />clear. <br />  I am not going to advocate any POV on <br />    the religious doctrines or what not. Also personal beliefs do <br />not <br />    count as theories &#40;like fossils being lost during the emergence <br />  of <br />    Himalayas&#41; unless backed by fine arguments. I look at it from a <br />  guy <br />    who has done his <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of scientific reading and much of what I <br />  read <br />    here is not quasi-science but pseudo-science.<br />     <br />    Lets deconstruct the points.<br />    1. &#39;Current timeline&#39; and &#39;theorizing evolution&#39;. I dont <br />  understand <br />    this current timeline <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. Are we talking about a parallel <br />  timeline <br />    as explained by the string theories? &#40;Three hours of full dose <br />    available here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="athttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/&amp;#41;">athttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/&amp;#41;</a><!-- m -->. Or <br />the <br />    timeline as we understand? And evolution is not a few thousand <br />  years <br />    of process but rather is going on for millions of years. Even <br />  human <br />    evolution runs into millions of years. So not sure where <br />    the &#39;thousands&#39; crept in. Genographic study is a totally <br />  different <br />    thing from evolution in that it attempts to map the migration <br />of <br />    humans across globe over the last 10-20 thousand years through <br />  DNA <br />    mapping. This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to <br />prove <br />    that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a common <br />  DNA. <br />    Same goes for the Earth&#39;s crust <br />    &#40;http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/<br />index.php&#41;. <br />    There has been a lot of geological research that has been done <br />  over <br />    the years from Charles Lyell&#39;s times&#40;who was an inspiration for <br />    Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory&#41; and ofcourse, <br />    geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

It is one thing to come up with hypothesis and another to <br />  talk <br />    it up like its fact. Sorry Venkatesh, Flintstones are still a <br />    fantasy only.<br />    3. Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in your <br />mail <br />    itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. Ofcourse, <br />  the <br />    footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what the <br />    archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that there <br />is <br />    still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to <br />know <br />  a <br />    lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely say <br />  that <br />    we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the <br />  depths <br />    of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the reasoning <br />    for &#39;Uthiramerur&#39; is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I&#39;ve read in this group <br />so <br />  far <br />    and so I chose to ignore it. <br />    I dont mind things being touted as based on religious <br />  observations <br />    or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency to <br />  mix <br />    science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked as <br />    factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist movement in <br />  US <br />    and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont think <br />it <br />  is <br />    necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which are <br />  clearly <br />    there to serve our vanities and nothing more. <br />     <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />     <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence <br />      during the dinosaur era and so on. <br />      <br />      Hi Venu<br />      is that so.? I thought the flintstones were pure fantasy.<br />      <br />      venketesh<br />      <br />      <br />      Again, this is a smaller time line <br />      compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize the <br />    majority <br />      of evolution. From: what I read, it looks like there are <br />  theories <br />      based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the <br />  closest <br />    to <br />      come on its time frame. <br />        Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great mystery <br />  and <br />      unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as <br />  explained: <br />    It <br />      is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground <br />level <br />    during <br />      the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds of <br />      archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden terrains <br />of <br />      himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth has <br />  been <br />      close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the <br />place <br />    where <br />      the keys have been lost is not the same where there is light <br />to <br />      search.<br />        Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and <br />  massive <br />      houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story to <br />all, <br />    but <br />      how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc <br />barring <br />  the <br />      large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and <br />    Pallavas. <br />      Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, the <br />  foot <br />      prints of millions of years can be burried into mother earth <br />  for <br />      good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, the <br />    ocean <br />      is a whole different story. <br />        Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a <br />  shortened <br />      sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />        I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under <br />  water, <br />    the <br />      1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had done so <br />  into <br />    a <br />      place &#40; older time was a mountain I believe&#41; called &#39;Uthira <br />  Meru - <br />      today&#39;s uthiramerur&#39; these places forming the great deccan <br />  plateau <br />      were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I believe. <br />        Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi <br />  scientific <br />      model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic <br />  tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /> <br />        <br />        Thanks folks!<br />        Ravi<br />        Muthu Prakash Ravindran  <br />      wrote: Hi<br />         <br />        I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />        1.

For that matter, I have also read a lot<br />        about Creationism and the common objections raised<br />        about Evolution and what Mr.Ram has raised is the most<br />        simple and often raised one.<br />        3. Theory that human evolution is simultaneous and so<br />        another ice age may end up in producing a new human<br />        history. This is again a &#39;faulty premise&#39;. I would<br />        think that the more advanced the civilization, the<br />        footprints will be more. Say the pyramids of Egypt or<br />        the Sumerian codes help us easily to decide what<br />        happened 5 thousand years back. At the same time,<br />        while humans were prowling in the heart of Africa or<br />        the Americas, where is the evidence of their life 5<br />        thousand years ago? Similarly, the example you&#39;ve<br />        quoted, New York is more likely to leave a bigger<br />        footprint for the future generations to decipher than<br />        the Australian aborigines. For the simple reason that<br />        the civilization is highly advanced. <br />        There is nothing logical in the lemurian theory. If<br />        there was a high civilization existed in these<br />        hypothetical lands, where are their foot prints? given<br />        that we place them within the timeframe of the<br />        Pyramids, where are their monuments under water? No<br />        evidence, but a bunch of theories from the Dravidian<br />        stalwarts&#40;who propagated this theory in the first<br />        place&#41; without even a semblance of proof attached to<br />        it. Read about how Mr.Vaiyapuri Pillai calculated the<br />        time of the Sangam literature &#40;he places the sangan<br />        periods in the 1-2 century AD&#41;. No one has refuted him<br />        on his method but always through the narrow eyes of a<br />        chauvinist. <br />         <br />        There is a book out there written by Sumathi Ramasamy<br />        &#39;Fabulous geographies, catastophic histories&#39; which<br />        deals well with the theory of Lemuria and<br />        unfortunately, no &#39;self-respected&#39; Tamil will read<br />        this and get some sort of enlightenment.<br />         <br />        Muthu Prakash R<br />         <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --> <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />         <br />        "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said <br />    Alice, &#39;because <br />      I&#39;m not myself you see.&#39;" <br />        -Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Greetings<br /><br />We are all interlinked, from a ball of fire to humans and buildings etc, by that conclusion checking for DNA of monkeys and Humans can be close enough. Forming a part of species does not necessarily mean they evolved from the other. Yes comprising a part of Brahma is not a physical stature but as a part of the Shrishti is what it really means.<br />Eric von daniken's chariots of Gods (substituting the alien key word with super beings) can give a potential for some different insight to evolution. I am not advocating it, however, it was interesting.<br /><br />PS: <br />Hi All, I apologize for not having introduced myself, the group has been so exciting that I fell prey to the occasion.<br />I am Ravi Venugopal, chennai is my birth city, a permanent resident of US. I run my own business in IT both in US and Chennai. I make frequent trips to India, making use of the free time to visit some age old temples and read about the Chola dynasty.<br />Currently, I am in Chennai and leaving back next weekend. It has been a pleasure interfacing with a great group so far.<br />I wish the fossil plan had been on a sunday, I would have tried my best to make it.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Ravi<br /><br />"R.venketesh"  wrote: : <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>sit in the dark and<br />wait for science to come up with something as absurd as Darwin&#39;s</div></blockquote>theory and obviously as always... ignorance can be bliss.<br /><br />Hi<br />i dont think you can write off the evolution theory especially since<br />our religion offers the alternative of us arriving on terra firma<br />from different parts of bramha's body<br />Dna tests are confirming that we are related to the monkeys. whether<br />they evolved from us or we evolved from them is another issue.<br />the closest living relatives of Homo sapiens are the two species of<br />chimpanzee: the Bonobo (Pan paniscus) and the Common Chimpanzee (Pan<br />troglodytes).

And of course, as I<br />said<br />  earlier, I am not going to get into the meta-physical world and<br />  derive facts for me.<br />  Science operates in two modes. One is theory and other is<br />  experiment. While the theory is proposed, it has to be proven by<br />  experiment. While the General theory of Relativity talked about<br />the<br />  gravitaion, only the actual observation of the trasit of venus<br />  proved it. Scientific method by itself is rigourous, self-<br />corrective<br />  and critique-driven. That is why it appeals to me.<br />  What you call fantasy is something that was proposed as a theory<br />and<br />  years of observation of the phenomenon and experiments have<br />provided<br />  proof to the fact. Evolutionary theory, as explained by Darwin,<br />has<br />  changed a lot today, although the basis remains the same, and has<br />  evolved itself through the self-correcting process of experiments<br />  and observations. The only POV acceptable here is the relentless<br />  pursuit of truth however hard-hitting it may be.<br />  On the other hand, the concept of lemuria is often confused with<br />the<br />  continental plates theory and there is not one iota of proof and<br />  what we have is a theory propagated by the sangam poets about<br />  kingdoms thousands of years old and by dravidian politicians who<br />  used it in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s as a tool to drive forth the Tamil<br />  nationalism. No proofs. In fact, no one is interested in proof as<br />it<br />  may not validate their POV. Even today, there is a lot of<br />confusion<br />  on what is in and what is out of this theory. In fact, I even saw<br />a<br />  map of the lemuria with the cities and mountains mapped out. Who<br />is<br />  the geographer who mapped it? Can you formulate a decent theory of<br />  Lemuria, some of which can be proved beyond doubt? We talk<br />  about &#39;Pahruli&#39; river, mt.Meru and a great city called ThenMadurai<br />  with a decent amount of population submerged in he oceans between<br />  Cape Kumari and Madagaskar and Java. But where is a theory which<br />  says this is what Lemuria is and ready to correct itself when<br />  evidence is found? The resistance to scientific approach is usual<br />in<br />  cases of dogma in relation to religion or politics. Here it is<br />both.<br />  My request is that you want to be proud of this forgotten<br />  civilization, please do. But dont shove it saying it is a fact<br />  waiting to be discovered.<br />  Everything that is there in Earth leaves its footprint. Chola<br />  temples, however few they may be, still are examples that this<br />great<br />  dynasty existed. There are only a few pyramids left, for that<br />  matter. Or may be a few skyscrapers left in NY. I remember the<br />last<br />  shot of that classic Charles Heston movie &#39;Planet of the apes&#39;<br />where<br />  he discovers the footprint of NYC.<br />  And ofcourse, science will take thousand of years for solving<br />issues<br />  like this precisely because of the amount of religious/political<br />  dogma attached to it. It took 2000 years to prove that earth<br />  revolved around the sun, but then it took another 200 years for<br />  people to belive the same.<br />  About the link, not sure you read through it. It talks about the<br />  explosion of placental mammals&#40;like rodents&#41; at the end of the<br />  Paleocene age. It is a long way from there to Homo species and to<br />  Home Sapiens. As part of the mammals, we can say our fellow<br />mammals,<br />  some rat-like creatures roamed with Dinosaurs &#40;that too only if<br />you<br />  believe the evolutionary fantasy!&#41;. Nothing more. This is what<br />  happens when things get reported in a tabloid channel like Channel<br />  four. I would say they should stick to &#39;Big Brother&#39; and not<br />bother<br />  science.<br /> <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    From an evolutionist point of view - what you can deem as<br />concrete<br />  evidence is what that meets the naked eye.

Or<br />the<br />    timeline as we understand? And evolution is not a few thousand<br />  years<br />    of process but rather is going on for millions of years. Even<br />  human<br />    evolution runs into millions of years. So not sure where<br />    the &#39;thousands&#39; crept in. Genographic study is a totally<br />  different<br />    thing from evolution in that it attempts to map the migration<br />of<br />    humans across globe over the last 10-20 thousand years through<br />  DNA<br />    mapping. This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to<br />prove<br />    that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a common<br />  DNA.<br />    Same goes for the Earth&#39;s crust<br />    &#40;http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/<br />index.php&#41;.<br />    There has been a lot of geological research that has been done<br />  over<br />    the years from Charles Lyell&#39;s times&#40;who was an inspiration for<br />    Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory&#41; and ofcourse,<br />    geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

It is one thing to come up with hypothesis and another to<br />  talk<br />    it up like its fact. Sorry Venkatesh, Flintstones are still a<br />    fantasy only.<br />    3. Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in your<br />mail<br />    itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. Ofcourse,<br />  the<br />    footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what the<br />    archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that there<br />is<br />    still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to<br />know<br />  a<br />    lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely say<br />  that<br />    we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the<br />  depths<br />    of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the reasoning<br />    for &#39;Uthiramerur&#39; is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I&#39;ve read in this group<br />so<br />  far<br />    and so I chose to ignore it.<br />    I dont mind things being touted as based on religious<br />  observations<br />    or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency to<br />  mix<br />    science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked as<br />    factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist movement in<br />  US<br />    and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont think<br />it<br />  is<br />    necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which are<br />  clearly<br />    there to serve our vanities and nothing more.<br />   <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"<br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence<br />      during the dinosaur era and so on.<br />     <br />      Hi Venu<br />      is that so.? I thought the flintstones were pure fantasy.<br />     <br />      venketesh<br />     <br />     <br />      Again, this is a smaller time line<br />      compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize the<br />    majority<br />      of evolution. From what I read, it looks like there are<br />  theories<br />      based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the<br />  closest<br />    to<br />      come on its time frame.<br />        Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great mystery<br />  and<br />      unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as<br />  explained: <br />    It<br />      is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground<br />level<br />    during<br />      the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds of<br />      archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden terrains<br />of<br />      himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth has<br />  been<br />      close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the<br />place<br />    where<br />      the keys have been lost is not the same where there is light<br />to<br />      search.<br />        Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and<br />  massive<br />      houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story to<br />all,<br />    but<br />      how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc<br />barring<br />  the<br />      large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and<br />    Pallavas.<br />      Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, the<br />  foot<br />      prints of millions of years can be burried into mother earth<br />  for<br />      good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, the<br />    ocean<br />      is a whole different story.<br />        Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a<br />  shortened<br />      sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />        I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under<br />  water,<br />    the<br />      1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had done so<br />  into<br />    a<br />      place &#40; older time was a mountain I believe&#41; called &#39;Uthira<br />  Meru -<br />      today&#39;s uthiramerur&#39; these places forming the great deccan<br />  plateau<br />      were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I believe.<br />        Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi<br />  scientific<br />      model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic<br />  tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />       <br />        Thanks folks!<br />        Ravi<br />        Muthu Prakash Ravindran <br />      wrote: Hi<br />       <br />        I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />        1. I think we need to tread carefully between the<br />        established facts and the theoretical hypothesis.<br />        While the existence of lemuria may be a fact, the<br />        sangam theory is only a hypothesis.<br />        2. Science needs concrete evidence and no half baked<br />        theories. My questions on Lemuria,<br />        a. Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution. Evolution is NOT a<br />        sequential process and the diagram based on which Ram<br />        bases his arguments &#40;why the monkeys havent become Men<br />        now?&#41; is a much touted cariacature of evolution<br />        propagadized by the anti-evolutionists.

For that matter, I have also read a lot<br />        about Creationism and the common objections raised<br />        about Evolution and what Mr.Ram has raised is the most<br />        simple and often raised one.<br />        3. Theory that human evolution is simultaneous and so<br />        another ice age may end up in producing a new human<br />        history. This is again a &#39;faulty premise&#39;. I would<br />        think that the more advanced the civilization, the<br />        footprints will be more. Say the pyramids of Egypt or<br />        the Sumerian codes help us easily to decide what<br />        happened 5 thousand years back. At the same time,<br />        while humans were prowling in the heart of Africa or<br />        the Americas, where is the evidence of their life 5<br />        thousand years ago? Similarly, the example you&#39;ve<br />        quoted, New York is more likely to leave a bigger<br />        footprint for the future generations to decipher than<br />        the Australian aborigines. For the simple reason that<br />        the civilization is highly advanced.<br />        There is nothing logical in the lemurian theory. If<br />        there was a high civilization existed in these<br />        hypothetical lands, where are their foot prints? given<br />        that we place them within the timeframe of the<br />        Pyramids, where are their monuments under water? No<br />        evidence, but a bunch of theories from the Dravidian<br />        stalwarts&#40;who propagated this theory in the first<br />        place&#41; without even a semblance of proof attached to<br />        it. Read about how Mr.Vaiyapuri Pillai calculated the<br />        time of the Sangam literature &#40;he places the sangan<br />        periods in the 1-2 century AD&#41;. No one has refuted him<br />        on his method but always through the narrow eyes of a<br />        chauvinist.<br />       <br />        There is a book out there written by Sumathi Ramasamy<br />        &#39;Fabulous geographies, catastophic histories&#39; which<br />        deals well with the theory of Lemuria and<br />        unfortunately, no &#39;self-respected&#39; Tamil will read<br />        this and get some sort of enlightenment.<br />       <br />        Muthu Prakash R<br />       <br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --><br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />       <br />        "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said<br />    Alice, &#39;because<br />      I&#39;m not myself you see.&#39;"<br />        -Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div></blockquote></div>

And of course, as I <br />  said <br />    earlier, I am not going to get into the meta-physical world and <br />    derive facts for me.<br />    Science operates in two modes. One is theory and other is <br />    experiment. While the theory is proposed, it has to be proven <br />by <br />    experiment. While the General theory of Relativity talked about <br />  the <br />    gravitaion, only the actual observation of the trasit of venus <br />    proved it. Scientific method by itself is rigourous, self-<br />  corrective <br />    and critique-driven. That is why it appeals to me. <br />    What you call fantasy is something that was proposed as a <br />theory <br />  and <br />    years of observation of the phenomenon and experiments have <br />  provided <br />    proof to the fact. Evolutionary theory, as explained by Darwin, <br />  has <br />    changed a lot today, although the basis remains the same, and <br />has <br />    evolved itself through the self-correcting process of <br />experiments <br />    and observations. The only POV acceptable here is the <br />relentless <br />    pursuit of truth however hard-hitting it may be.<br />    On the other hand, the concept of lemuria is often confused <br />with <br />  the <br />    continental plates theory and there is not one iota of proof <br />and <br />    what we have is a theory propagated by the sangam poets about <br />    kingdoms thousands of years old and by dravidian politicians <br />who <br />    used it in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s as a tool to drive forth the Tamil <br />    nationalism. No proofs. In fact, no one is interested in proof <br />as <br />  it <br />    may not validate their POV. Even today, there is a lot of <br />  confusion <br />    on what is in and what is out of this theory. In fact, I even <br />saw <br />  a <br />    map of the lemuria with the cities and mountains mapped out. <br />Who <br />  is <br />    the geographer who mapped it? Can you formulate a decent theory <br />of <br />    Lemuria, some of which can be proved beyond doubt? We talk <br />    about &#39;Pahruli&#39; river, mt.Meru and a great city called <br />ThenMadurai <br />    with a decent amount of population submerged in he oceans <br />between <br />    Cape Kumari and Madagaskar and Java. But where is a theory <br />which <br />    says this is what Lemuria is and ready to correct itself when <br />    evidence is found? The resistance to scientific approach is <br />usual <br />  in <br />    cases of dogma in relation to religion or politics. Here it is <br />  both. <br />    My request is that you want to be proud of this forgotten <br />    civilization, please do. But dont shove it saying it is a fact <br />    waiting to be discovered.<br />    Everything that is there in Earth leaves its footprint. Chola <br />    temples, however few they may be, still are examples that this <br />  great <br />    dynasty existed. There are only a few pyramids left, for that <br />    matter. Or may be a few skyscrapers left in NY. I remember the <br />  last <br />    shot of that classic Charles Heston movie &#39;Planet of the apes&#39; <br />  where <br />    he discovers the footprint of NYC.<br />    And ofcourse, science will take thousand of years for solving <br />  issues <br />    like this precisely because of the amount of religious/<br />political <br />    dogma attached to it. It took 2000 years to prove that earth <br />    revolved around the sun, but then it took another 200 years for <br />    people to belive the same. <br />    About the link, not sure you read through it. It talks about <br />the <br />    explosion of placental mammals&#40;like rodents&#41; at the end of the <br />    Paleocene age. It is a long way from there to Homo species and <br />to <br />    Home Sapiens. As part of the mammals, we can say our fellow <br />  mammals, <br />    some rat-like creatures roamed with Dinosaurs &#40;that too only if <br />  you <br />    believe the evolutionary fantasy!&#41;. Nothing more. This is what <br />    happens when things get reported in a tabloid channel like <br />Channel <br />    four. I would say they should stick to &#39;Big Brother&#39; and not <br />  bother <br />    science.<br />     <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />     <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  <br />    wrote:<br />     <br />      From: an evolutionist point of view - what you can deem as <br />  concrete <br />    evidence is what that meets the naked eye.

And evolution is not a few <br />thousand <br />    years <br />      of process but rather is going on for millions of years. <br />Even <br />    human <br />      evolution runs into millions of years. So not sure where <br />      the &#39;thousands&#39; crept in. Genographic study is a totally <br />    different <br />      thing from evolution in that it attempts to map the <br />migration <br />  of <br />      humans across globe over the last 10-20 thousand years <br />through <br />    DNA <br />      mapping. This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to <br />  prove <br />      that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a <br />common <br />    DNA. <br />      Same goes for the Earth&#39;s crust <br />      &#40;http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/<br />  index.php&#41;. <br />      There has been a lot of geological research that has been <br />done <br />    over <br />      the years from Charles Lyell&#39;s times&#40;who was an inspiration <br />for <br />      Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory&#41; and <br />ofcourse, <br />      geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in your <br />  mail <br />      itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. <br />Ofcourse, <br />    the <br />      footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what <br />the <br />      archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that <br />there <br />  is <br />      still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need to <br />  know <br />    a <br />      lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely <br />say <br />    that <br />      we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the <br />    depths <br />      of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the <br />reasoning <br />      for &#39;Uthiramerur&#39; is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I&#39;ve read in this <br />group <br />  so <br />    far <br />      and so I chose to ignore it. <br />      I dont mind things being touted as based on religious <br />    observations <br />      or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency <br />to <br />    mix <br />      science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked <br />as <br />      factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist movement <br />in <br />    US <br />      and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont <br />think <br />  it <br />    is <br />      necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which are <br />    clearly <br />      there to serve our vanities and nothing more. <br />       <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />       <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence <br />        during the dinosaur era and so on. <br />        <br />        Hi Venu<br />        is that so.? I thought the flintstones were pure fantasy.<br />        <br />        venketesh<br />        <br />        <br />        Again, this is a smaller time line <br />        compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize <br />the <br />      majority <br />        of evolution. From: what I read, it looks like there are <br />    theories <br />        based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the <br />    closest <br />      to <br />        come on its time frame. <br />          Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great <br />mystery <br />    and <br />        unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as <br />    explained: <br />      It <br />        is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground <br />  level <br />      during <br />        the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds of <br />        archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden <br />terrains <br />  of <br />        himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth <br />has <br />    been <br />        close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the <br />  place <br />      where <br />        the keys have been lost is not the same where there is <br />light <br />  to <br />        search.<br />          Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and <br />    massive <br />        houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story to <br />  all, <br />      but <br />        how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc <br />  barring <br />    the <br />        large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and <br />      Pallavas. <br />        Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, <br />the <br />    foot <br />        prints of millions of years can be burried into mother <br />earth <br />    for <br />        good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, <br />the <br />      ocean <br />        is a whole different story. <br />          Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a <br />    shortened <br />        sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />          I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under <br />    water, <br />      the <br />        1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had done <br />so <br />    into <br />      a <br />        place &#40; older time was a mountain I believe&#41; called <br />&#39;Uthira <br />    Meru - <br />        today&#39;s uthiramerur&#39; these places forming the great deccan <br />    plateau <br />        were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I <br />believe. <br />          Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi <br />    scientific <br />        model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic <br />    tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /> <br />          <br />          Thanks folks!<br />          Ravi<br />          Muthu Prakash Ravindran  <br />        wrote: Hi<br />           <br />          I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />          1. I think we need to tread carefully between the<br />          established facts and the theoretical hypothesis.<br />          While the existence of lemuria may be a fact, the<br />          sangam theory is only a hypothesis. <br />          2. Science needs concrete evidence and no half baked<br />          theories. My questions on Lemuria,<br />          a. Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution. Evolution is NOT a<br />          sequential process and the diagram based on which Ram<br />          bases his arguments &#40;why the monkeys havent become Men<br />          now?&#41; is a much touted cariacature of evolution<br />          propagadized by the anti-evolutionists. Evolution<br />          proceeds as a &#39;punctuated equilibrium&#39; &#40;jay goulds<br />          word for it&#41; and for more read here.<br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolweb.org/tree/">http://www.tolweb.org/tree/</a><!-- m --><br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigins/ha/a_tree.html">http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigi ... _tree.html</a><!-- m --><br />          I, for one, is a deeply scientific person and my<br />          learning experience is that evolution needs a lot of<br />          reading and understanding &#40;like any other scientific<br />          theory do&#41; not just an off-handed remark dismissing<br />          the same. For that matter, I have also read a lot<br />          about Creationism and the common objections raised<br />          about Evolution and what Mr.Ram has raised is the most<br />          simple and often raised one.<br />          3. Theory that human evolution is simultaneous and so<br />          another ice age may end up in producing a new human<br />          history. This is again a &#39;faulty premise&#39;. I would<br />          think that the more advanced the civilization, the<br />          footprints will be more. Say the pyramids of Egypt or<br />          the Sumerian codes help us easily to decide what<br />          happened 5 thousand years back. At the same time,<br />          while humans were prowling in the heart of Africa or<br />          the Americas, where is the evidence of their life 5<br />          thousand years ago? Similarly, the example you&#39;ve<br />          quoted, New York is more likely to leave a bigger<br />          footprint for the future generations to decipher than<br />          the Australian aborigines. For the simple reason that<br />          the civilization is highly advanced. <br />          There is nothing logical in the lemurian theory. If<br />          there was a high civilization existed in these<br />          hypothetical lands, where are their foot prints? given<br />          that we place them within the timeframe of the<br />          Pyramids, where are their monuments under water? No<br />          evidence, but a bunch of theories from the Dravidian<br />          stalwarts&#40;who propagated this theory in the first<br />          place&#41; without even a semblance of proof attached to<br />          it. Read about how Mr.Vaiyapuri Pillai calculated the<br />          time of the Sangam literature &#40;he places the sangan<br />          periods in the 1-2 century AD&#41;. No one has refuted him<br />          on his method but always through the narrow eyes of a<br />          chauvinist. <br />           <br />          There is a book out there written by Sumathi Ramasamy<br />          &#39;Fabulous geographies, catastophic histories&#39; which<br />          deals well with the theory of Lemuria and<br />          unfortunately, no &#39;self-respected&#39; Tamil will read<br />          this and get some sort of enlightenment.<br />           <br />          Muthu Prakash R<br />           <br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --> <br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />           <br />          "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said <br />      Alice, &#39;because <br />        I&#39;m not myself you see.&#39;" <br />          -Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">What differenciates Science(the morsel of grain) from the rest is <br />the way this relentless pursuit of truth is being conducted. As I <br />mentioned earlier, science is always open to critiques and corrects <br />itself when proven wrong. I am yet to find an approach that can beat <br />this. If we have believed only what meets the naked eye exists, we <br />may not have found the power of atom. Science goes beyond what is <br />seen and speculates. That is what is called theories and hypotheses. <br />I wonder where I disputed that 'there are things in this word to be <br />discovered'. Wouldnt the world be a big bore if there is nothing to <br />be discovered? What I am trying to hammer at you is that there is <br />not a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of scientific approach in the question of lemuria and it <br />is driven only by religious/political dogma. The failure of you to <br />show a standard theory for the, lets say, philosophy of 'lemuria' <br />just reinforces the point.<br />Not all things leave footprints. Agreed. If mighty kingdoms can <br />leave minuscle footprints like the Big temple, where is the foot <br />print of the still mightier continent of lemuria? I am saying it <br />only existed in the imagination of the Sangam poets! Please disprove <br />by citing some proofs and I will agree. Please dont delve back into <br />the metaphysical realm by saying truth cannot be seen or I need to <br />belive it on faith (I do that with my religion, so I dont need a <br />lemuria in my pooja room, Thank you!).<br />Dear sir, the 'Earth is flat' theory was known in theoretical form <br />from the days of Aristotle during the Greek enlightenment age. <br />People just believed the same during the dark ages. As put forth <br />from you, lets assume that our ancestors 'knew' all along that <br />the 'Earth is slightly spherodical'. Now, What we have as proof for <br />this is a bunch of quotations from various texts which are being <br />cited after the fact. Its exactly like the prophesices of <br />Nostradamus where the events are matched with the prophesies and not <br />the other way around.<br />I am fascinated by the fact that you call 'Darwins theory' a fantasy <br />and also surprised by the amount of contempt you have for science. <br />Knowing by the link you sent earlier, I am a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> skeptic that you've <br />read any of the material I sent earlier. Now please let me know your <br />theory based on the religious texts (I presume you are talking of <br />the Hindu ones!). Not sure whether you are advocating that we all (I <br />mean all species) were built(for want of a better word) on the same <br />day, a la creation based on Bible. Lets have a real discusssion as <br />to the merits of it and do enlighten this ignorant fellow here. <br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Greetings<br />  <br />  We are all interlinked, from a ball of fire to humans and <br />buildings etc, by that conclusion checking for DNA of monkeys and</div></blockquote>Humans can be close enough.

And of course, as <br />I <br />  said <br />    earlier, I am not going to get into the meta-physical world <br />and <br />    derive facts for me.<br />    Science operates in two modes. One is theory and other is <br />    experiment. While the theory is proposed, it has to be proven <br />by <br />    experiment. While the General theory of Relativity talked <br />about <br />  the <br />    gravitaion, only the actual observation of the trasit of venus <br />    proved it. Scientific method by itself is rigourous, self-<br />  corrective <br />    and critique-driven. That is why it appeals to me. <br />    What you call fantasy is something that was proposed as a <br />theory <br />  and <br />    years of observation of the phenomenon and experiments have <br />  provided <br />    proof to the fact. Evolutionary theory, as explained by <br />Darwin, <br />  has <br />    changed a lot today, although the basis remains the same, and <br />has <br />    evolved itself through the self-correcting process of <br />experiments <br />    and observations. The only POV acceptable here is the <br />relentless <br />    pursuit of truth however hard-hitting it may be.<br />    On the other hand, the concept of lemuria is often confused <br />with <br />  the <br />    continental plates theory and there is not one iota of proof <br />and <br />    what we have is a theory propagated by the sangam poets about <br />    kingdoms thousands of years old and by dravidian politicians <br />who <br />    used it in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s as a tool to drive forth the <br />Tamil <br />    nationalism. No proofs. In fact, no one is interested in proof <br />as <br />  it <br />    may not validate their POV. Even today, there is a lot of <br />  confusion <br />    on what is in and what is out of this theory. In fact, I even <br />saw <br />  a <br />    map of the lemuria with the cities and mountains mapped out. <br />Who <br />  is <br />    the geographer who mapped it? Can you formulate a decent <br />theory of <br />    Lemuria, some of which can be proved beyond doubt? We talk <br />    about &#39;Pahruli&#39; river, mt.Meru and a great city called <br />ThenMadurai <br />    with a decent amount of population submerged in he oceans <br />between <br />    Cape Kumari and Madagaskar and Java. But where is a theory <br />which <br />    says this is what Lemuria is and ready to correct itself when <br />    evidence is found? The resistance to scientific approach is <br />usual <br />  in <br />    cases of dogma in relation to religion or politics. Here it is <br />  both. <br />    My request is that you want to be proud of this forgotten <br />    civilization, please do. But dont shove it saying it is a fact <br />    waiting to be discovered.<br />    Everything that is there in Earth leaves its footprint. Chola <br />    temples, however few they may be, still are examples that this <br />  great <br />    dynasty existed. There are only a few pyramids left, for that <br />    matter. Or may be a few skyscrapers left in NY. I remember the <br />  last <br />    shot of that classic Charles Heston movie &#39;Planet of the apes&#39; <br />  where <br />    he discovers the footprint of NYC.<br />    And ofcourse, science will take thousand of years for solving <br />  issues <br />    like this precisely because of the amount of <br />religious/political <br />    dogma attached to it. It took 2000 years to prove that earth <br />    revolved around the sun, but then it took another 200 years <br />for <br />    people to belive the same. <br />    About the link, not sure you read through it. It talks about <br />the <br />    explosion of placental mammals&#40;like rodents&#41; at the end of the <br />    Paleocene age. It is a long way from there to Homo species and <br />to <br />    Home Sapiens. As part of the mammals, we can say our fellow <br />  mammals, <br />    some rat-like creatures roamed with Dinosaurs &#40;that too only <br />if <br />  you <br />    believe the evolutionary fantasy!&#41;. Nothing more. This is what <br />    happens when things get reported in a tabloid channel like <br />Channel <br />    four. I would say they should stick to &#39;Big Brother&#39; and not <br />  bother <br />    science.<br />     <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />     <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  <br />    wrote:<br />     <br />      From: an evolutionist point of view - what you can deem as <br />  concrete <br />    evidence is what that meets the naked eye.

This is a genetic study which by mapping tries to <br />  prove <br />      that human ancestors were from Africa and we all share a <br />common <br />    DNA. <br />      Same goes for the Earth&#39;s crust <br />      &#40;http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/<br />  index.php&#41;. <br />      There has been a lot of geological research that has been <br />done <br />    over <br />      the years from Charles Lyell&#39;s times&#40;who was an inspiration <br />for <br />      Darwin to come up with his Evolutionary theory&#41; and <br />ofcourse, <br />      geology is a strong factor in support of Darwin.

It is one thing to come up with hypothesis and <br />another to <br />    talk <br />      it up like its fact. Sorry Venkatesh, Flintstones are still <br />a <br />      fantasy only.<br />      3. Footprints. Sir, the answer to your question lies in <br />your <br />  mail <br />      itself. The temples are the footprints of the Cholas. <br />Ofcourse, <br />    the <br />      footprints of millions of years is buried and that is what <br />the <br />      archeological digs are used for! If your theory is that <br />there <br />  is <br />      still so much buried inside Earth, I agree. We still need <br />to <br />  know <br />    a <br />      lot but with the current level of knowledge we can safely <br />say <br />    that <br />      we are not going to unearth the first Tamil Sangam from the <br />    depths <br />      of Indian ocean especially lemuria. And ofcourse, the <br />reasoning <br />      for &#39;Uthiramerur&#39; is the funniest <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> I&#39;ve read in this <br />group <br />  so <br />    far <br />      and so I chose to ignore it. <br />      I dont mind things being touted as based on religious <br />    observations <br />      or personal beliefs. What I dont understand is the tendency <br />to <br />    mix <br />      science and religion and come up with hypothesises cloaked <br />as <br />      factual bearings. This is true with the Creationist <br />movement in <br />    US <br />      and while I take pride in our cultural heritage, I dont <br />think <br />  it <br />    is <br />      necessary to over-do it by coming up with theories which <br />are <br />    clearly <br />      there to serve our vanities and nothing more. <br />       <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />       <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        we have been able to recognize man&#39;s presence <br />        during the dinosaur era and so on. <br />        <br />        Hi Venu<br />        is that so.? I thought the flintstones were pure fantasy.<br />        <br />        venketesh<br />        <br />        <br />        Again, this is a smaller time line <br />        compared to the existence of earth. We can only theorize <br />the <br />      majority <br />        of evolution. From: what I read, it looks like there are <br />    theories <br />        based on mappings, the genographic study is probably the <br />    closest <br />      to <br />        come on its time frame. <br />          Again, the crust of the earth is by itself a great <br />mystery <br />    and <br />        unconquered by man. A simple reason could be stated as <br />    explained: <br />      It <br />        is a known fact that the himalayas were closer to ground <br />  level <br />      during <br />        the ice age and they have grown ever since, so the odds <br />of <br />        archeologists working on deep segments of forbidden <br />terrains <br />  of <br />        himalayas are very less and even if they did, the growth <br />has <br />    been <br />        close to 10000 feet which by itself says a lot. Thus the <br />  place <br />      where <br />        the keys have been lost is not the same where there is <br />light <br />  to <br />        search.<br />          Also on the footprint left behind, the huge fortess and <br />    massive <br />        houses of Cholas and other kings are a well known story <br />to <br />  all, <br />      but <br />        how many do we see in Urayur / Tanjore / Kudanthai etc <br />  barring <br />    the <br />        large temples and fort of Saraboji. Same with Pandyas and <br />      Pallavas. <br />        Now if this can be said for forts of a few hundred years, <br />the <br />    foot <br />        prints of millions of years can be burried into mother <br />earth <br />    for <br />        good. Now again, we are only discussing the top of crust, <br />the <br />      ocean <br />        is a whole different story. <br />          Hence my personal opinion is, these theories follow a <br />    shortened <br />        sight of timeline whereas the real truth is different.<br />          I believe, there has been a Mt.Meru and it is now under <br />    water, <br />      the <br />        1st sangam which tried to replicate the mountain, had <br />done so <br />    into <br />      a <br />        place &#40; older time was a mountain I believe&#41; <br />called &#39;Uthira <br />    Meru - <br />        today&#39;s uthiramerur&#39; these places forming the great <br />deccan <br />    plateau <br />        were once prior to ice age great mountains, or so I <br />believe. <br />          Again, these are plain points to consider in a quasi <br />    scientific <br />        model or be dismissed as rumblings of another fanatic <br />    tamilian <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /> <br />          <br />          Thanks folks!<br />          Ravi<br />          Muthu Prakash Ravindran  <br />        wrote: Hi<br />           <br />          I watched with some interest the discussions on this.<br />          1. I think we need to tread carefully between the<br />          established facts and the theoretical hypothesis.<br />          While the existence of lemuria may be a fact, the<br />          sangam theory is only a hypothesis. <br />          2. Science needs concrete evidence and no half baked<br />          theories. My questions on Lemuria,<br />          a. Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution. Evolution is NOT a<br />          sequential process and the diagram based on which Ram<br />          bases his arguments &#40;why the monkeys havent become Men<br />          now?&#41; is a much touted cariacature of evolution<br />          propagadized by the anti-evolutionists. Evolution<br />          proceeds as a &#39;punctuated equilibrium&#39; &#40;jay goulds<br />          word for it&#41; and for more read here.<br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolweb.org/tree/">http://www.tolweb.org/tree/</a><!-- m --><br />           <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigins/ha/a_tree.html">http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigi ... _tree.html</a><!-- m --><br />          I, for one, is a deeply scientific person and my<br />          learning experience is that evolution needs a lot of<br />          reading and understanding &#40;like any other scientific<br />          theory do&#41; not just an off-handed remark dismissing<br />          the same. For that matter, I have also read a lot<br />          about Creationism and the common objections raised<br />          about Evolution and what Mr.Ram has raised is the most<br />          simple and often raised one.<br />          3. Theory that human evolution is simultaneous and so<br />          another ice age may end up in producing a new human<br />          history. This is again a &#39;faulty premise&#39;. I would<br />          think that the more advanced the civilization, the<br />          footprints will be more. Say the pyramids of Egypt or<br />          the Sumerian codes help us easily to decide what<br />          happened 5 thousand years back. At the same time,<br />          while humans were prowling in the heart of Africa or<br />          the Americas, where is the evidence of their life 5<br />          thousand years ago? Similarly, the example you&#39;ve<br />          quoted, New York is more likely to leave a bigger<br />          footprint for the future generations to decipher than<br />          the Australian aborigines. For the simple reason that<br />          the civilization is highly advanced. <br />          There is nothing logical in the lemurian theory. If<br />          there was a high civilization existed in these<br />          hypothetical lands, where are their foot prints? given<br />          that we place them within the timeframe of the<br />          Pyramids, where are their monuments under water? No<br />          evidence, but a bunch of theories from the Dravidian<br />          stalwarts&#40;who propagated this theory in the first<br />          place&#41; without even a semblance of proof attached to<br />          it. Read about how Mr.Vaiyapuri Pillai calculated the<br />          time of the Sangam literature &#40;he places the sangan<br />          periods in the 1-2 century AD&#41;. No one has refuted him<br />          on his method but always through the narrow eyes of a<br />          chauvinist. <br />           <br />          There is a book out there written by Sumathi Ramasamy<br />          &#39;Fabulous geographies, catastophic histories&#39; which<br />          deals well with the theory of Lemuria and<br />          unfortunately, no &#39;self-respected&#39; Tamil will read<br />          this and get some sort of enlightenment.<br />           <br />          Muthu Prakash R<br />           <br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --> <br />         <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />           <br />          "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said <br />      Alice, &#39;because <br />        I&#39;m not myself you see.&#39;" <br />          -Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div></blockquote></div>
