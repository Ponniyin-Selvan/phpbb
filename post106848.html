			<div class="content">Well then, that is the rule of thumb to any saint.<br />A person in Civavakiyar's position can obviously say that 'hariyum <br />sivanum onnu ariyatavar vayile mannu'. But that does not work from <br />day one for any person. It would rather land up as dangerous, I <br />personally believe these rebellious messages landed up in period of <br />time where there was discrimination against some communities, while <br />not exactly liberating others.<br /><br />He was a great saint, I am sure he had brahmin devotees at his time <br />and I am sure he has worshipped idols on his way too. I do not think <br />it is fair to read his works with a narrow thought process. A person <br />who see's multiple samathuvams in one, is bound to see humans as one <br />and idols to non idols. That level is not reached in day 1 of <br />progress.<br /><br />I would suggest reading his works with a way too broader mind than <br />constraining it to a small social reforming path. I am reading the <br />verses and to me it is extraordinary genius.<br /><br />-- R<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>"just dismiss them as rumblings<br />  of a person with unstable mind"<br />  <br />  I think these same lines was uttered to him during his life time by<br />  many people....he has written a poem for this situation...its given <br />below<br />  <br />  <br />  you who are foolish <br />  will say: <br />  &#39;These Shiddas are small men&#39;<br />  you who are foolish<br />  will even think<br />  These Siddhas are mad.<br />  Yes!<br />  although they are here,<br />  they live in the realm and sphere<br />  of the Madman.<br />  That&#39;s why for them<br />  this world<br />  and His world<br />  are one. <br />  Poet: Civavakkiyar<br />  Translated by Kamil Zvelebil<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br />   <br />    Dear Vairam<br />    <br />    I dont really see any brahminical criticisum in here.

			<div class="content">The facts about Civavakkiyar is as below,<br /><br />Name: <br />Legend: He uttered the word Shiva while he was born.<br />Possible truth: Named after his work Civavakkiyam.<br /><br />Period: <br />First there needs this clarification - There are two Pattinattar in<br />Tamil literature.<br />One in 10th century and author of Thriuvidamarudur Mummani Kovai<br />other in 14th - 15th century.<br />Other in 14-15th century and his works are compiled as Ptinathar Padalgal.<br /><br />The first Patinathar quoted a Civavakkiya Tevar in his poem. This<br />makes age of Civavakkiyar earlier to 10th century.<br /><br />But Author of Civavakkiyam seems to have great knowledge in Saiva<br />Shiddantha and has used Urdu loan words in his work. This makes his <br />works dated to later period.<br /><br />He is quoted by Tattuvaryar(14century) and Civananavallal(15 century)<br />and commentary of Maraianacampanthar. This puts in a Age before 16th<br />century.<br /><br />The solution provided by scholars is that possibly Civavakkiyatevar<br />was different from the author of Civavakkiyam.<br /><br />This puts the dating of Author of Civavakkiyam- Civavakkiyar to around<br />13-15th century.<br /><br /><br /><br />Life: <br />Legend: Born as a Brahmin, married a low community women(Kuravar<br />women), received initiations form guru Konkanar and started performing<br />miracles.He is supposed to have made pilgrimage to Benares(this might<br />be based on allusions in one of his poems).<br /><br />Regards,<br />Vairam<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br />   <br />    Nakkirar is dated any where between 6-9 th century<br />    The most famous work of this Nakkirar is a commentary to Iraivanar<br />    Agaporul....since time period of Thirumurgatrupadai is also same...<br />  ---------------------<br />  Re: SANGAM LITERATURE <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br />   wrote on 18.4.2008 : <br />  <br />  ===================<br />  PN Bose :: Epoches of Civilisation.<br />  <br />  Judged by the standard of the motive or the ruling idea alone, each<br />  of the Literature can be classified under the Naturalistic, the<br />  Ethical and the Religeous.<br />  <br />  The poem composed during the Naturalistic period, man&#39;s life and his<br />  surroundings are dealt with in their most elementary phases and the<br />  poets, one and all, seem occupied with depicting these in<br />  their "unadorned simplicity".<br />  <br />  In the Ethical period, however they try to grapple with the<br />  questions of conduct and character arising from the various complex<br />  relations of life in soceity and appear generally preoccupied with<br />  the evolution of a code of morals and polity to form the basis of an<br />  ordered social life;<br />  <br />  In the Religeous period, the Poets seem to quit man&#39;s earthly<br />  existence and his limited interests therein and turned on a higher<br />  and grander sphere, the destiny of his soul beyond time.<br />  <br />  In the first period, their lives took on a secular colour and came<br />  to be reflected as such in the literature of that period.

My path is also learn true <br />history<br />  , but it is very very very small scale compared to yours. I loved<br />  history from my school. Have distinction of being in top .2% of <br /><acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education">CBSE</acronym><br />  exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never had habit of <br />reading<br />  books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail fowards.<br />  I had gone across certain sources that Murugan and Skanda might be<br />  different gods earlier. In search for this, accidentally this year <br />in<br />  January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />  The book made me realise the following things: <br />  the richness of Tamil Sangam and following literatures.<br />  And mainly the need for critical study.<br />  <br />  Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in critical study I saw<br />  various hypothesis and interpretation of different <br />scholars...rather a<br />  survey first and the author examining each work and telling his<br />  comments and putting forward his idea if he had...in way leaving <br />the<br />  reader make use his brain and think which should be right based on<br />  various arguments...<br />  <br />  After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki&#39;s . Which ever <br />area  <br />  I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography in Smile of <br />Murugan<br />  and started applying the books in inter library loan.<br />  <br />  We should be indebted to works of A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />  Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />  Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for the simplicity of<br />  his language. Any common reader can understand what he says. <br />  <br />  One thing I have to say in this regard is&#40;though some people might <br />not<br />  accept it&#41;..there is some sort of bias knowingly or unknowingly <br />among<br />  the Indian Historians when it comes to religion and esp <br />Tamil/Sanskrit<br />  timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />  historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand <br />which<br />  when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is <br />totally<br />  unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.<br />  <br />  Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />  emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that <br />is<br />  questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />  only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if <br />it<br />  means somebody says &#39;people of your caste are murders&#39;...its<br />  offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our <br />eyes<br />  we r not going to get the truth.<br />  <br />  True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />  politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />  obstruct and stop it.<br />  <br />  I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But this is what I <br />feel<br />  about True History. Unless and until people leave out their <br />emotions<br />  and prejudicial notions true history is very hard to come.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Vairam<br />===============================</div></blockquote><br />Dear Vairam,<br /><br />HISTORY is defined by various Historians .. <br />Study of History is known as Historiography...<br /><br />Among several observations, the one frequently flashes to my mind <br />is : HISTORY is believed to be True, till it is proved otherwise .. <br />by another find (theory )..<br /><br />This is acceptable .. because ..<br /><br />In the Archieves you can find details that the Big temple, thanjavur <br />was built by Karikalan. Leave aside the Western mentions..  <br />PERUVUDAYAR ULA, published just 200 years back, by the Support of <br />Adheenams mentioned this...<br /><br />And when the British took up "inscriptions reading" they found it <br />was Rajaraja who built it !!!<br /><br />And they only brought out the Dynasty ...<br /><br />Whenever you find time, go through the FOREWORDs in the South Indian <br />Inscriptions by History-Giants like Venkayya, Krishna Sastry, there <br />will be conflicting views between the earlier Edition and Subsequent <br />Edition, because NEWER FACTS have come to the light...<br /><br />Like popular belief was it was Narasimha I who built Darmaraja <br />Ratham etc., But Dr. Nagaswamy in the 70s itself found that it was <br />Rajasimha - known as Adyanthakaman - who built it !!<br /><br />By this, I mention that a SECONDARY SOURCES .. (including this <br />Message, SECONDARY SOURCE - that it is Dr. Nagaswamy who declared <br />that Darmarajaratham was built by Rajasimha and NOT by Narasimha ) <br />also need to be checked for conclusiveness ..<br /><br />For that a view need to be discussed primarily ...<br /><br />My message was in persuing deeper studies in the direction of <br />convincing ourselves .. either before we advocate a view or to <br />substantiate the same after we have advocated..<br /><br />Not to discourage views ... On the contrary to entertain more <br />related views ..<br /><br />This lengthy mail was to draw your attention to the fact that when <br /><acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> Sastry wrote his Books - in about 1932 - the materials available <br />in front of him were considerably new and lesser ...<br /><br />But he is NOT vastly contradicted even by the Tanjai Tholliyal Team <br />of nintys ...<br /><br />thanks and regards / sps</div>
