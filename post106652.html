I agree with you on why<br />people do not like <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is a little beyond me too.<br /><br />I wanted to tell you one thing though, enakku sila<br />samayam kashtamaga irukku, educated ladies thinking<br />some characters are great like vanavan madhevi. A lady<br />in any time who wants to allow her husband to be with<br />someone else...adhulla ennanga periya perumai???<br />Sivakami was not a historical figure so whether the<br />real vanavam madhevi was like that or not is not<br />really an issue. And Kalki many times wrote to cater<br />to audience taste of his time. Why did he not allow<br />Sivakami to think like that? To be a second wife to<br />Narasimha after he was married? No, she was too<br />dignified and proud to become that way and I find it<br />easy to respect her for that.<br /><br />Munnam avan naamam kettal patri neengal solvadhu<br />mutrilum sariye....sorry if I hurt your sentiments but<br />I just wanted to share some thoughts, that is all.<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br />--- bhuvaneshwari sundaram<br /> wrote: <br /><br />------------ --------- --------- ---<br /><br /><br />hi all,<br /><br />i've not participated in many of ur discussions ..but<br />read everything..<br /><br />i couldn't get why people don't like(0r not that<br />interested to read) <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>...<br /><br />it is one of the greatest novel of kalki..<br /><br />vanmadevi's character will be wonderfully portrayed by<br />kalki..indeed the character's explanation will be<br />given in one chapter that worth the novel....her<br />affection towards narashimapallavan. ..her magnanimity<br />towards sivakami, to even giveup her princess<br />position,from her character kalki means to say how a<br />wife should be...though there are many other<br />characters.. .i've strong bond towards vanamadevi.. .<br />And also in the song "munnam avanudaya nammam kettal "<br />from thiruvarur thandagam..i bet u can never find<br />anyother song like that which depicts thalaivi's<br />kathal especially the line "annaiyum atthanayum andre<br />neethal ,agandral agalidathar, asarathai thanai<br />maranthal than namam kettal thalaipattal nagai<br />thalaivan thale"... i firmly believe <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is one of the<br />greatest literary work of kalki...<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Bhuvaneshwari.<br /><br />------------ --------- --------- ---<br />Explore your hobbies and interests.

(B)<br /><br />the diadem( crown jewel) finds mention in the mahavamsa (A) below - <br />the buddhist chronicles of srilanka ( for the sake of argument - <br />cross reference from the other side)<br /><br />the meeikirthi of rajendra sings his praise for bringing this back...<br /><br />Tirumalai Rock inscription(2) of Rajendra <br />having seized the crown of the king of Ilam (on) the<br />tempestuous ocean; the exceedingly fine crowns of the<br />queens of that (king); the beautiful crown and the<br />necklace of Indra, which the king of the South (i.e.<br />the Pandya) had previously deposited with that (king<br />of Ilam); the whole Ila-mandala (on) the transparent<br />sea."<br /><br /><br />A) <br /><br />quoting from the<br />Mahavamsam account( srilanka)<br /><br />During the reign of Dappula V (918-930), a Pandya<br />king came to Ceylon to ask for Dappula's help<br />against the Colas. Since the assistance was refused<br />he betook himself to the Kerala country, leaving his<br />diadem in Ceylon (Mahav. 53, 5ff). Under king Udaya<br />II (942-950) a Cola king sent his army to Ceylon to<br />fetch the Pandya crown (Mahav, 53, 40ff.) But<br />although the Colas were victorious in battle and<br />conquered the northern provinces, Udaya succeeded in<br />escaping to Rohana with the crown and other<br />treasures. The victorious Cola king was no doubt<br />again Parantaka I (907-947), mentioned above, for he<br />calls himself in his latest inscriptions conqueror of<br />Ilam i.e, Ceylon.(1)<br /><br />A diadem (from the Greek 'diadema' from 'diadeo' to bind round, or<br />fasten) was originally a white ribbon, ending in a knot and two<br />strips that were placed often on the shoulders, that surrounded the<br />head of the king to denote his authority.By extension, this term was<br />applied later to a crown, generally with a circular shape.<br /><br />(AuthorÃ¢Â€Â™s Note: Chola inscriptions found in India by King Rajendra<br />Chola indicates Pandu King<br />fled to Lanka and left the diadem in Lanka. It further states that<br />he brought back the diadem from<br />Lanka.<br /><br />Udaya IV: (955 AD Ã¢Â€" 964 AD)<br />After Sena, Udaya became the King.<br />Chola Attack: <br />During King UdayaÃ¢Â€Â™s time, Chola King, sent messengers demanding the<br />diadem left by the Pandu<br />King. King Udaya refused to send the diadem to the Chola King. Chola<br />King sent a huge army and<br />defeated King UdayaÃ¢Â€Â™s army. King Udaya fled to Rohana.<br /><br />In A.D. 981 the weak king Mahinda V ascended the<br />throne of Ceylon. Since he was unable to pay them,<br />tile Kerala and other mercenaries rebelled. Mahinda<br />fled to Rohana, but in Northern Ceylon the<br />mercenaries carried on a military dictatorship. The<br />Cola king, turning the confusion in Ceylon to his own<br />advantage, sent troops to tile island (Mahav. 55, 14<br />ff.). The Colas advanced on Rohana, captured the king<br />and the queen alive and brought them with all their<br />treasures to India. This took place in the 36th year<br />of Mahinda's reign, i.e. A.D. 1017,<br /><br /><br /><br />B)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/silapadikaram2-13/</div></blockquote>wow vairam,<br /><br />Nice one - and see the link to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - the line below<br /><br />"<br />It blows through the palace of great Pandya king,who wears on his<br />broad chest a chain of gold that the king of the gods once gave him"<br /><br />this is the royal diadem - pandya haram - king of gods ( indra??)<br />indra haramum - so this was well known even during the<br />silapathigaram days .....true to its claim..... in whose pursuit<br />arulmozhi goes to lanka - which is finally retrived by rajendra -<br />and sung its praise in his meeikirthi.</div>

Under king Udaya<br />  II &#40;942-950&#41; a Cola king sent his army to Ceylon to<br />  fetch the Pandya crown &#40;Mahav, 53, 40ff.&#41; But<br />  although the Colas were victorious in battle and<br />  conquered the northern provinces, Udaya succeeded in<br />  escaping to Rohana with the crown and other<br />  treasures. The victorious Cola king was no doubt<br />  again Parantaka I &#40;907-947&#41;, mentioned above, for he<br />  calls himself in his latest inscriptions conqueror of<br />  Ilam i.e, Ceylon.&#40;1&#41;<br />  <br />  A diadem &#40;from the Greek &#39;diadema&#39; from &#39;diadeo&#39; to bind round, or<br />  fasten&#41; was originally a white ribbon, ending in a knot and two<br />  strips that were placed often on the shoulders, that surrounded the<br />  head of the king to denote his authority.By extension, this term <br />was<br />  applied later to a crown, generally with a circular shape.<br />  <br />  &#40;AuthorÃ¢Â€Â™s Note: Chola inscriptions found in India by King <br />Rajendra<br />  Chola indicates Pandu King<br />  fled to Lanka and left the diadem in Lanka. It further states that<br />  he brought back the diadem from<br />  Lanka.<br />  <br />  Udaya IV: &#40;955 AD Ã¢Â€" 964 AD&#41;<br />  After Sena, Udaya became the King.<br />  Chola Attack: <br />  During King UdayaÃ¢Â€Â™s time, Chola King, sent messengers demanding <br />the<br />  diadem left by the Pandu<br />  King. King Udaya refused to send the diadem to the Chola King. <br />Chola<br />  King sent a huge army and<br />  defeated King UdayaÃ¢Â€Â™s army. King Udaya fled to Rohana.<br />  <br />  In A.D. 981 the weak king Mahinda V ascended the<br />  throne of Ceylon. Since he was unable to pay them,<br />  tile Kerala and other mercenaries rebelled. Mahinda<br />  fled to Rohana, but in Northern Ceylon the<br />  mercenaries carried on a military dictatorship. The<br />  Cola king, turning the confusion in Ceylon to his own<br />  advantage, sent troops to tile island &#40;Mahav. 55, 14<br />  ff.&#41;. The Colas advanced on Rohana, captured the king<br />  and the queen alive and brought them with all their<br />  treasures to India. This took place in the 36th year<br />  of Mahinda&#39;s reign, i.e. A.D. 1017,<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  B&#41;<br />  <br />  <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/silapadikaram2-13/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04 ... karam2-13/</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />  <br />  wow vairam,<br />  <br />  Nice one - and see the link to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - the line below<br />  <br />  "<br />  It blows through the palace of great Pandya king,who wears on his<br />  broad chest a chain of gold that the king of the gods once gave <br />him"<br />  <br />  this is the royal diadem - pandya haram - king of gods &#40; indra??&#41;<br />  indra haramum - so this was well known even during the<br />  silapathigaram days .....true to its claim..... in whose pursuit<br />  arulmozhi goes to lanka - which is finally retrived by rajendra -<br />  and sung its praise in his meeikirthi.</div></blockquote></div>

The reign of Kassapa V, king of Ceylon, came to an<br />end, according to Hultzsch's revised chronology, in A.D. 916, or<br />perhaps 917. His successors reigned only seven months, and then<br />Dappula V obtained the throne in 917. Shortly before the death of<br />Kassapa V, we are told in the Mahavamsa (ch. 1ii), the Pandya king,<br />Rajasimha III, sent many presents to, and begged aid from Kassapa<br />against the Cholas who had seized his country in or before A.D. 909.<br />Kassapa sent over to the mainland an army to his assistance.<br />Rajasimha led both armies against<br /><br />Parantaka's troops but was defeated and retired leaving the<br />singhalese to carry on the war alone.But their army was attacked by<br />disease and their general died from it, and they returned to Ceylon.<br /><br />Dappula V having become king of the island, Rajasimha, driven to<br />desperation, crossed over to Ceylon, and the two kings prepared for<br />a fresh war against the Cholas. But owing to grave internal<br />disturbances Dappula had to abandon the enterprise. And the Pandya<br />king fled to the Kerala country, leaving his crown and other<br />apparel ' in Ceylon. This event may have taken place in A.D. 917-18.<br />Amongst the apparel was ' the necklace of Indra ', as we learn from<br />the story of what took place later. (Mahawamsa, ch. 1iii )<br /><br />This was the second war with Ceylon of Parantaka I, who then assumed<br />the title ' Samagrama Raghava.<br /><br />[A;D. 952. King Mahindu IV of Ceylon came to the throne in this<br />year according to Dr. Hultzsch's Singhalese chronology. He was<br />attacked by an army sent from the Tamil country by .a king whom the<br />Mahavamsa, calls the ''chola-Vallabha?.* It Is not known 'to<br />whom this refers. ' Vallabha 'is a Chalukya title. The Chola kings<br />of the time of Mahinda IV (A.D. 952-968) were Gangaraditya and<br />Arinijaya. (Mahavamsa, ch. 1 iv]<br /><br />This was the first year of Parantaka Chola II, alias Sundara ChSla,<br />Rajakesarivarman. Two of his queens are named, one being a Chera<br />princess who lived till 1012. He had a general named siriya-<br />Velar, who was killed in Ceylon in the king's ninth year (see 116 of<br />1895). This would be in A.D. 963-64, during the reign of Mahindu IV,<br />king of Ceylon, and the war in which he lost his life would be the<br />same as is referred to above (s. v., A.
