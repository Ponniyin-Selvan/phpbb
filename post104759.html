While reading I felt all through the<br />      novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />     <br />      Poonguzhali&#39;s towards Arulmozhi: I didn&#39;t feel like<br />      poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />      of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />     <br />      Nandhini&#39;s towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />      selfish love. When she knows that she won&#39;t be able to<br />      get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />      "You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />      about!!!!"<br />     <br />      Vanadhi&#39;s towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai&#39;s towards<br />      VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />     <br />      Generally positions and throne and all won&#39;t matter<br />      much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />      beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />      pattamagishi or not, it wudn&#39;t impact much since<br />      anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />      that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />      Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />     <br />      Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini&#39;s is<br />      selfless and great. But still eventhough she hadn&#39;t<br />      been living with Sundara Chola throughout her lifetime<br />      atleast she had been with him for somedays, loved him<br />      and been loved by him. For that love, she cud have<br />      sacrificed and saved Sudara and his son.<br />     <br />      But in case of Manimegalai, she has been really<br />      selfless to sacrifice even her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> not knowing<br />      for sure whether he loves her or not..<br />     <br />      Manimegalai tops the rating!!!!!!!!!!<br />     <br />      Cheers,<br />      Sathya<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      sridhar rathinam sridhar_rathinam@y...<br />      Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 12:44 am<br />      Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Thanks Ram and Sathya..<br />     <br />      That was interesting..i agree with you..Manthagini and<br />    Manimegalai in that order.Manthagini inspite of her being wronged<br />    still does everything for her beloved..Kalki really potrays her true<br />    love so well...especially in the scenes where she dots around Arun<br />    mozhi varman.....<br />     <br />      No wonder they immortalised her by making her a Goddess even<br />    today there is a Temple for the SingalaNachi Amman in Thanjavur OFF<br />    Medical College road which allegedly was built for Mandhakini by<br />    Arunmozhi....<br />     <br />      Manimegalai had all the sweet innocence and sacrifices everything<br />    for her love..well whether manimegalai would have loved<br />Vandhiyadevan<br />    inspite of his betrayal...Mm well she knows he didnt love her and<br />    used her with his seettalk to get near Karikalan she forgives him<br />and<br />    loves him so I m sure She would have done the same...True love<br />always<br />    does it.<br />     <br />      Nandhini...well did she really love one person atleast<br />    truely...that&#39;s the question which Kalki leaves us with..but she<br />    constantly does keep reminding Karikalan of her love..even before<br />his<br />    death..<br />     <br />      Kunthavai..the potrayal of her charecter is so high that she<br />    never reveals her love or mental urmaoil..Infact in the whole series<br />    there would be tears in her eyes only on a few occasions...<br />     <br />      Vanathi what starts as an innocent love later becomes<br />    mature....she even dares to attain gajendra motcham for Arunmozhi..<br />     <br />      Pongulali...well it aws just a sort of Infactuation...crush sort<br />    of thing..<br />     <br />      The importnat tHing about Kalki is people and their attitute<br />    changes from Time to ..I found it hard to beleive as normal when I<br />    first read it in sixth standard&#40;and hve read it almost every year<br />    during the final exams a great stress releiver&#41; but as I have grown<br />    older..

But as a princess, she has to<br />    be. When taking<br />      kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of things. A<br />    princess of a<br />      big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, actually,<br />      falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you<br />    look at the<br />      way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and helps the<br />    love to grow<br />      between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she wanted to<br />    be in Chozha<br />      nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn&#39;t<br />      have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th<br />    bagam if I am<br />      right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything else in her<br />    life. She<br />      knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and for that<br />    what she can<br />      expect in return. She is pretty clear.<br />     <br />      * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />     <br />      She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have<br />    to keep that in<br />      mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and she<br />    takes a wow that<br />      she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As Ram<br />    aptly puts it,<br />      the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />      harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />     <br />      * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />     <br />      As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in<br />    love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />      from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she loves her<br />    brother so<br />      much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her brother&#41; has<br />    been<br />      instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, its because<br />    she<br />      realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is<br />    wrong that she<br />      goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation where<br />    she loves this<br />      guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a<br />    conflicting version and<br />      then she realizes something else. And in the end, everything<br />      goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its<br />    fate that<br />      plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with the<br />    love she has for<br />      <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to her<br />    brother, I doubt<br />      she would have acted the way she did. That&#39;s not in her<br />    character.<br />     <br />      * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />     <br />      Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example<br />    of leaf who<br />      is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants as and<br />    when she wants to<br />      just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I doubt if she<br />    herself knows<br />      what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is power. In<br />      the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />    seeing how strong<br />      his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />    But in the end<br />      she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat elsewhere. But she<br />    did have a<br />      lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />      again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people<br />    including Ravidasan.<br />     <br />      * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />     <br />      She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost<br />    his way. So all<br />      she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s another<br />    love at first<br />      sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy from a<br />    bear. She is an<br />      exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />      around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and<br />    disappointment in<br />      life. But her love for one man in her life is predominant above<br />    everything<br />      else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She keeps<br />    roaming around SC<br />      and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />      time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life<br />    in the process<br />      of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary character who<br />    cant be compared<br />      to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her love with<br />    anyone&#39;s for as<br />      I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life was<br />      dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br />     <br />      * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />     <br />      This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She<br />    realized that there<br />      was no point in going ahead with something that would never get<br />    fulfilled.<br />      Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the love<br />    that Sendhan<br />      Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise decision both<br />    for<br />      herself and for AM.<br />     <br />     <br />      Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would<br />    say it was<br />      Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And she<br />    died in the<br />      process of saving his life.<br />     <br />      But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give<br />    &#40;she too has<br />      plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things accordingly and<br />    handling things<br />      accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself and is<br />    clear in what<br />      she wants and what she can give. She is not interested in going<br />      about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste<br />    her time on it.<br />      I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own life<br />    happy rather than<br />      creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That way, I<br />    would rate<br />      Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second.<br />     <br />      I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain<br />    Head by Any<br />      Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a<br />    particular place,<br />      that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I love you&#39; you<br />    cannot understand<br />      what it actually means to love another person. That way, I feel<br />    both<br />      Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and<br />    emphatically.<br />     <br />      To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and<br />    both you and<br />      your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. That<br />    way I feel the<br />      only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and Kundhavai.<br />    And both do<br />      not expect anything in return for their love. They are happy and<br />      they make their loved ones happy too.<br />     <br />      My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />     <br />      thanks,<br />      Vidya.<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Pavithra Srinivasan" pavithrasri@h...<br />      Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:10 pm<br />      Subject: RE: Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Bravo! That Poonghuzhali&#39;s love would be better than either<br />    Mandhakini&#39;s or<br />      Manimegalai&#39;s I&#39;d not considered before.

Did Kalki<br />    cleverly use a<br />      decrepit temple to bring in Mandhakini&#39;s existence, or did it all<br />    happen<br />      like Kalki portrays in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>...in a way, did Mandhakini really exist?<br />     <br />      And did Uthama Chozhar really marry a &#39;Odakkaara penn&#39; ??<br />     <br />      Oh experts of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, please clarify...<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />     <br />      Pavithra.<br />     <br />     <br />      "Eswaran" eswnat@y...<br />      Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:24 pm<br />      Subject: <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      You have mentioned only Female charecter&#39;s love in each of<br />      the case either beauty or diginity plays a major role.<br />      Even in the case of Manthagini, we all know that Sundara<br />      Cholan was the most handsome person during that period and<br />      being a Deaf & dum Manthagini&#39;s love towards him is to certain<br />      extent I would call as selfish.<br />     <br />      But "Senthan Amuthan&#39;s love towards Poonkuzhali is abosolutely a<br />      great one and divine one.

love.She was<br />      greatly impressed by <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It was his &#39;character&#39; that<br />      made her love him.He had all qualifications she<br />      expected like someone who would stay with in Chola<br />      empire..But She was not &#39;just a princess&#39;.She was a<br />      very important person who was involved in<br />      administration,whose opnions were greatly valued.When<br />      <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> was imprisoned she could not cry like<br />      Manimekalai.She carefully handled the kingdom,the<br />      politics,her brother,her father and also her love.Her<br />      love was not &#39;the most important&#39; in her view.Yet she<br />      wouldn&#39;t have loved anyone else too.<br />      So she was first a princess and then a lover.<br />     <br />      Poonkullai loved Arulmolli as people of chola kingdom<br />      did.It was not true love-she admired him,liked him but<br />      was not sure whether she wanted to live in a palace or<br />      not.She realised the true love of Senthan AMuthan and<br />      reciprocated to it.It was Senthan Amuthan&#39;s love that<br />      made her love him.So her love becomes a deeper one.<br />     <br />      Vanathi&#39;s love...she loved Arul Molli varmar and not<br />      Rajarajachola&#40;i.e the king&#41;.Her love was love at first<br />      sight.She would do anything for Arulmozhivarmar.<br />     <br />      Nandhini&#39;s love for Karikalan...it&#39;s not true love.She<br />      wanted to be rich,to be a queen and that made her love<br />      him.It was clearly a love for purpose.<br />     <br />      Mandhahini and her father only lived in that<br />      island.Imagine Mandhahini alone in a island meets a<br />      handsome stranger who loves her even when he knows she<br />      is dumb.So naturally she loved him.Her life was filled<br />      with joy when she was with Sundara Chola.So he is the<br />      only one she loved forever.Her love had no bounds.It&#39;s<br />      well expressed in the story.She was a noble character.<br />     <br />      Manimekalai&#39;s love was blind.From the words of her<br />      brother she started loving <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.She really didn&#39;t know<br />      much about him.It was her imaginations that made her<br />      love him.Even it is her imagination the made her<br />      mentally disturbed in the end.So it was a mad love.<br />     <br />      Now which is better-a matured love,love at first<br />      sight,blind love,love for purpose,or love the extends<br />      to generations.<br />      Not only Mandhahini, Pooonguzhali & Vanathi would have<br />      sacrificed their lives for their love and would have<br />      shown kindness to their children.&#40;I think so!&#41;<br />     <br />      But there is onething-the love of Nandhini for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It<br />      is not insisted much.yet it made me think - Nandhini<br />      form her childhood wanted power & wealth and was<br />      making moves to get that.Yet she lost her heart to<br />      <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.Her psoition was critical-she wanted to take<br />      revenge,restore Padyas to power,Kill Karikalan--yet<br />      she had a love which could never be expressed and<br />      which would never be accepted.But I know that there&#39;ll<br />      be contradictions whether she loved <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> or not.<br />     <br />      Among all I find love of Kundhavai & Nandhini to<br />      <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>,because they considered love to be an important<br />      part of life-yet a part of life.It is the practical<br />      way too.<br />     <br />      Regarding changing the title-<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is better.Even there<br />      came a &#39;thodar&#39;in Kalki titled <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> which explained the<br />      life of Kalki.So kaliki is <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.I welcome discussions on<br />      other novels also.<br />     <br />      yours<br />      Im.Lakshmi<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Thank you fiends for all your participation and commentsÂ…<br />     <br />      Sridhar<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Regards<br />      Sri<br />     <br />      ragavadacri ragavadacri@ wrote: <br />    Dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> fans,<br />     <br />      I am also an &#39;adimai&#39;

While reading I felt all through the<br />        novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />       <br />        Poonguzhali&#39;s towards Arulmozhi: I didn&#39;t feel like<br />        poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />        of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />       <br />        Nandhini&#39;s towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />        selfish love. When she knows that she won&#39;t be able to<br />        get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />        "You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />        about!!!!"<br />       <br />        Vanadhi&#39;s towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai&#39;s towards<br />        VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />       <br />        Generally positions and throne and all won&#39;t matter<br />        much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />        beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />        pattamagishi or not, it wudn&#39;t impact much since<br />        anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />        that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />        Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />       <br />        Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini&#39;s is<br />        selfless and great. But still eventhough she hadn&#39;t<br />        been living with Sundara Chola throughout her lifetime<br />        atleast she had been with him for somedays, loved him<br />        and been loved by him. For that love, she cud have<br />        sacrificed and saved Sudara and his son.<br />       <br />        But in case of Manimegalai, she has been really<br />        selfless to sacrifice even her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> not knowing<br />        for sure whether he loves her or not..<br />       <br />        Manimegalai tops the rating!!!!!!!!!!<br />       <br />        Cheers,<br />        Sathya<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        sridhar rathinam sridhar_rathinam@y...<br />        Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 12:44 am<br />        Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest <br />Love?<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Thanks Ram and Sathya..<br />       <br />        That was interesting..i agree with you..Manthagini and<br />      Manimegalai in that order.Manthagini inspite of her being <br />wronged<br />      still does everything for her beloved..Kalki really potrays her <br />true<br />      love so well...especially in the scenes where she dots around <br />Arun<br />      mozhi varman.....<br />       <br />        No wonder they immortalised her by making her a Goddess even<br />      today there is a Temple for the SingalaNachi Amman in Thanjavur <br />OFF<br />      Medical College road which allegedly was built for Mandhakini by<br />      Arunmozhi....<br />       <br />        Manimegalai had all the sweet innocence and sacrifices <br />everything<br />      for her love..well whether manimegalai would have loved<br />  Vandhiyadevan<br />      inspite of his betrayal...Mm well she knows he didnt love her <br />and<br />      used her with his seettalk to get near Karikalan she forgives <br />him<br />  and<br />      loves him so I m sure She would have done the same...True love<br />  always<br />      does it.<br />       <br />        Nandhini...well did she really love one person atleast<br />      truely...that&#39;s the question which Kalki leaves us with..but she<br />      constantly does keep reminding Karikalan of her love..even <br />before<br />  his<br />      death..<br />       <br />        Kunthavai..the potrayal of her charecter is so high that she<br />      never reveals her love or mental urmaoil..Infact in the whole <br />series<br />      there would be tears in her eyes only on a few occasions...<br />       <br />        Vanathi what starts as an innocent love later becomes<br />      mature....she even dares to attain gajendra motcham for <br />Arunmozhi..<br />       <br />        Pongulali...well it aws just a sort of Infactuation...crush <br />sort<br />      of thing..<br />       <br />        The importnat tHing about Kalki is people and their attitute<br />      changes from Time to ..I found it hard to beleive as normal <br />when I<br />      first read it in sixth standard&#40;and hve read it almost every <br />year<br />      during the final exams a great stress releiver&#41; but as I have <br />grown<br />      older..

But as a princess, she has to<br />      be. When taking<br />        kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of things. A<br />      princess of a<br />        big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, <br />actually,<br />        falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If <br />you<br />      look at the<br />        way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and helps <br />the<br />      love to grow<br />        between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she wanted <br />to<br />      be in Chozha<br />        nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she <br />needn&#39;t<br />        have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the <br />4th<br />      bagam if I am<br />        right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything else in <br />her<br />      life. She<br />        knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and for <br />that<br />      what she can<br />        expect in return. She is pretty clear.<br />       <br />        * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />       <br />        She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We <br />have<br />      to keep that in<br />        mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and she<br />      takes a wow that<br />        she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As <br />Ram<br />      aptly puts it,<br />        the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />        harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />       <br />        * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />       <br />        As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually <br />falls in<br />      love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />        from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she loves <br />her<br />      brother so<br />        much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her brother&#41; has<br />      been<br />        instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, its <br />because<br />      she<br />        realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is<br />      wrong that she<br />        goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation <br />where<br />      she loves this<br />        guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a<br />      conflicting version and<br />        then she realizes something else. And in the end, everything<br />        goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. <br />Its<br />      fate that<br />        plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with the<br />      love she has for<br />        <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to her<br />      brother, I doubt<br />        she would have acted the way she did. That&#39;s not in her<br />      character.<br />       <br />        * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />       <br />        Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic <br />example<br />      of leaf who<br />        is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants as and<br />      when she wants to<br />        just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I doubt if <br />she<br />      herself knows<br />        what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is power. In<br />        the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />      seeing how strong<br />        his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall for <br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />      But in the end<br />        she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat elsewhere. But <br />she<br />      did have a<br />        lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />        again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people<br />      including Ravidasan.<br />       <br />        * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />       <br />        She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have <br />lost<br />      his way. So all<br />        she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s another<br />      love at first<br />        sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy from a<br />      bear. She is an<br />        exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 years. <br />Roams<br />        around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and<br />      disappointment in<br />        life. But her love for one man in her life is predominant <br />above<br />      everything<br />        else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She keeps<br />      roaming around SC<br />        and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves AM <br />many a<br />        time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her <br />life<br />      in the process<br />        of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary character who<br />      cant be compared<br />        to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her love with<br />      anyone&#39;s for as<br />        I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life was<br />        dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br />       <br />        * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />       <br />        This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She<br />      realized that there<br />        was no point in going ahead with something that would never <br />get<br />      fulfilled.<br />        Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the love<br />      that Sendhan<br />        Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise decision <br />both<br />      for<br />        herself and for AM.<br />       <br />       <br />        Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would<br />      say it was<br />        Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And she<br />      died in the<br />        process of saving his life.<br />       <br />        But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can <br />give<br />      &#40;she too has<br />        plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things accordingly and<br />      handling things<br />        accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself and <br />is<br />      clear in what<br />        she wants and what she can give. She is not interested in <br />going<br />        about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and <br />waste<br />      her time on it.<br />        I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own life<br />      happy rather than<br />        creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That way, I<br />      would rate<br />        Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second.<br />       <br />        I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain<br />      Head by Any<br />        Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a<br />      particular place,<br />        that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I love you&#39; you<br />      cannot understand<br />        what it actually means to love another person. That way, I <br />feel<br />      both<br />        Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and<br />      emphatically.<br />       <br />        To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and<br />      both you and<br />        your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. <br />That<br />      way I feel the<br />        only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and <br />Kundhavai.<br />      And both do<br />        not expect anything in return for their love. They are happy <br />and<br />        they make their loved ones happy too.<br />       <br />        My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />       <br />        thanks,<br />        Vidya.<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Pavithra Srinivasan" pavithrasri@h...<br />        Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:10 pm<br />        Subject: RE: Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Bravo!

love.She was<br />        greatly impressed by <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It was his &#39;character&#39; that<br />        made her love him.He had all qualifications she<br />        expected like someone who would stay with in Chola<br />        empire..But She was not &#39;just a princess&#39;.She was a<br />        very important person who was involved in<br />        administration,whose opnions were greatly valued.When<br />        <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> was imprisoned she could not cry like<br />        Manimekalai.She carefully handled the kingdom,the<br />        politics,her brother,her father and also her love.Her<br />        love was not &#39;the most important&#39; in her view.Yet she<br />        wouldn&#39;t have loved anyone else too.<br />        So she was first a princess and then a lover.<br />       <br />        Poonkullai loved Arulmolli as people of chola kingdom<br />        did.It was not true love-she admired him,liked him but<br />        was not sure whether she wanted to live in a palace or<br />        not.She realised the true love of Senthan AMuthan and<br />        reciprocated to it.It was Senthan Amuthan&#39;s love that<br />        made her love him.So her love becomes a deeper one.<br />       <br />        Vanathi&#39;s love...she loved Arul Molli varmar and not<br />        Rajarajachola&#40;i.e the king&#41;.Her love was love at first<br />        sight.She would do anything for Arulmozhivarmar.<br />       <br />        Nandhini&#39;s love for Karikalan...it&#39;s not true love.She<br />        wanted to be rich,to be a queen and that made her love<br />        him.It was clearly a love for purpose.<br />       <br />        Mandhahini and her father only lived in that<br />        island.Imagine Mandhahini alone in a island meets a<br />        handsome stranger who loves her even when he knows she<br />        is dumb.So naturally she loved him.Her life was filled<br />        with joy when she was with Sundara Chola.So he is the<br />        only one she loved forever.Her love had no bounds.It&#39;s<br />        well expressed in the story.She was a noble character.<br />       <br />        Manimekalai&#39;s love was blind.From the words of her<br />        brother she started loving <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.She really didn&#39;t know<br />        much about him.It was her imaginations that made her<br />        love him.Even it is her imagination the made her<br />        mentally disturbed in the end.So it was a mad love.<br />       <br />        Now which is better-a matured love,love at first<br />        sight,blind love,love for purpose,or love the extends<br />        to generations.<br />        Not only Mandhahini, Pooonguzhali & Vanathi would have<br />        sacrificed their lives for their love and would have<br />        shown kindness to their children.&#40;I think so!&#41;<br />       <br />        But there is onething-the love of Nandhini for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It<br />        is not insisted much.yet it made me think - Nandhini<br />        form her childhood wanted power & wealth and was<br />        making moves to get that.Yet she lost her heart to<br />        <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.Her psoition was critical-she wanted to take<br />        revenge,restore Padyas to power,Kill Karikalan--yet<br />        she had a love which could never be expressed and<br />        which would never be accepted.But I know that there&#39;ll<br />        be contradictions whether she loved <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> or not.<br />       <br />        Among all I find love of Kundhavai & Nandhini to<br />        <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>,because they considered love to be an important<br />        part of life-yet a part of life.It is the practical<br />        way too.<br />       <br />        Regarding changing the title-<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is better.Even there<br />        came a &#39;thodar&#39;in Kalki titled <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> which explained the<br />        life of Kalki.So kaliki is <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.I welcome discussions on<br />        other novels also.<br />       <br />        yours<br />        Im.Lakshmi<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Thank you fiends for all your participation and commentsÂ…<br />       <br />        Sridhar<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        Regards<br />        Sri<br />       <br />        ragavadacri ragavadacri@ wrote: <br />      Dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> fans,<br />       <br />        I am also an &#39;adimai&#39;

While reading I felt all through the<br />          novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />         <br />          Poonguzhali&#39;s towards Arulmozhi: I didn&#39;t feel like<br />          poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />          of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />         <br />          Nandhini&#39;s towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />          selfish love. When she knows that she won&#39;t be able to<br />          get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />          "You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />          about!!!!"<br />         <br />          Vanadhi&#39;s towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai&#39;s towards<br />          VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />         <br />          Generally positions and throne and all won&#39;t matter<br />          much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />          beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />          pattamagishi or not, it wudn&#39;t impact much since<br />          anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />          that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />          Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />         <br />          Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini&#39;s is<br />          selfless and great.

But as a princess, she <br />has to<br />        be. When taking<br />          kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of <br />things. A<br />        princess of a<br />          big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, <br />  actually,<br />          falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. <br />If <br />  you<br />        look at the<br />          way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and <br />helps <br />  the<br />        love to grow<br />          between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she <br />wanted <br />  to<br />        be in Chozha<br />          nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she <br />  needn&#39;t<br />          have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in <br />the <br />  4th<br />        bagam if I am<br />          right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything else <br />in <br />  her<br />        life. She<br />          knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and <br />for <br />  that<br />        what she can<br />          expect in return. She is pretty clear.<br />         <br />          * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />         <br />          She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We <br />  have<br />        to keep that in<br />          mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and <br />she<br />        takes a wow that<br />          she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi&#40;pm&#41;. <br />As <br />  Ram<br />        aptly puts it,<br />          the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />          harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />         <br />          * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />         <br />          As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually <br />  falls in<br />        love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />          from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she <br />loves <br />  her<br />        brother so<br />          much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her brother&#41; <br />has<br />        been<br />          instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, its <br />  because<br />        she<br />          realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />is<br />        wrong that she<br />          goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation <br />  where<br />        she loves this<br />          guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a<br />        conflicting version and<br />          then she realizes something else. And in the end, <br />everything<br />          goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to <br />pieces. <br />  Its<br />        fate that<br />          plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with <br />the<br />        love she has for<br />          <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to <br />her<br />        brother, I doubt<br />          she would have acted the way she did. That&#39;s not in her<br />        character.<br />         <br />          * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />         <br />          Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic <br />  example<br />        of leaf who<br />          is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants as <br />and<br />        when she wants to<br />          just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I doubt <br />if <br />  she<br />        herself knows<br />          what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is power. <br />In<br />          the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />        seeing how strong<br />          his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall <br />for <br />  <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />        But in the end<br />          she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat elsewhere. <br />But <br />  she<br />        did have a<br />          lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar <br />though<br />          again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people<br />        including Ravidasan.<br />         <br />          * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />         <br />          She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have <br />  lost<br />        his way. So all<br />          she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s <br />another<br />        love at first<br />          sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy from <br />a<br />        bear. She is an<br />          exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 <br />years. <br />  Roams<br />          around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief <br />and<br />        disappointment in<br />          life. But her love for one man in her life is predominant <br />  above<br />        everything<br />          else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She <br />keeps<br />        roaming around SC<br />          and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves AM <br />  many a<br />          time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses <br />her <br />  life<br />        in the process<br />          of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary character <br />who<br />        cant be compared<br />          to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her love <br />with<br />        anyone&#39;s for as<br />          I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life was<br />          dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br />         <br />          * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />         <br />          This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She<br />        realized that there<br />          was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />never <br />  get<br />        fulfilled.<br />          Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the <br />love<br />        that Sendhan<br />          Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise decision <br />  both<br />        for<br />          herself and for AM.<br />         <br />         <br />          Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we <br />would<br />        say it was<br />          Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And <br />she<br />        died in the<br />          process of saving his life.<br />         <br />          But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl <br />can <br />  give<br />        &#40;she too has<br />          plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things accordingly <br />and<br />        handling things<br />          accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself <br />and <br />  is<br />        clear in what<br />          she wants and what she can give. She is not interested in <br />  going<br />          about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and <br />  waste<br />        her time on it.<br />          I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own <br />life<br />        happy rather than<br />          creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That <br />way, I<br />        would rate<br />          Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second.<br />         <br />          I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called <br />Fountain<br />        Head by Any<br />          Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a<br />        particular place,<br />          that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I love you&#39; you<br />        cannot understand<br />          what it actually means to love another person. That way, I <br />  feel<br />        both<br />          Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and<br />        emphatically.<br />         <br />          To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well <br />and<br />        both you and<br />          your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. <br />  That<br />        way I feel the<br />          only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and <br />  Kundhavai.<br />        And both do<br />          not expect anything in return for their love. They are <br />happy <br />  and<br />          they make their loved ones happy too.<br />         <br />          My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />         <br />          thanks,<br />          Vidya.<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Pavithra Srinivasan" pavithrasri@h...<br />          Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:10 pm<br />          Subject: RE: Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Bravo!

love.She was<br />          greatly impressed by <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It was his &#39;character&#39; that<br />          made her love him.He had all qualifications she<br />          expected like someone who would stay with in Chola<br />          empire..But She was not &#39;just a princess&#39;.She was a<br />          very important person who was involved in<br />          administration,whose opnions were greatly valued.When<br />          <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> was imprisoned she could not cry like<br />          Manimekalai.She carefully handled the kingdom,the<br />          politics,her brother,her father and also her love.Her<br />          love was not &#39;the most important&#39; in her view.Yet she<br />          wouldn&#39;t have loved anyone else too.<br />          So she was first a princess and then a lover.<br />         <br />          Poonkullai loved Arulmolli as people of chola kingdom<br />          did.It was not true love-she admired him,liked him but<br />          was not sure whether she wanted to live in a palace or<br />          not.She realised the true love of Senthan AMuthan and<br />          reciprocated to it.It was Senthan Amuthan&#39;s love that<br />          made her love him.So her love becomes a deeper one.<br />         <br />          Vanathi&#39;s love...she loved Arul Molli varmar and not<br />          Rajarajachola&#40;i.e the king&#41;.Her love was love at first<br />          sight.She would do anything for Arulmozhivarmar.<br />         <br />          Nandhini&#39;s love for Karikalan...it&#39;s not true love.She<br />          wanted to be rich,to be a queen and that made her love<br />          him.It was clearly a love for purpose.<br />         <br />          Mandhahini and her father only lived in that<br />          island.Imagine Mandhahini alone in a island meets a<br />          handsome stranger who loves her even when he knows she<br />          is dumb.So naturally she loved him.Her life was filled<br />          with joy when she was with Sundara Chola.So he is the<br />          only one she loved forever.Her love had no bounds.It&#39;s<br />          well expressed in the story.She was a noble character.<br />         <br />          Manimekalai&#39;s love was blind.From the words of her<br />          brother she started loving <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.She really didn&#39;t know<br />          much about him.It was her imaginations that made her<br />          love him.Even it is her imagination the made her<br />          mentally disturbed in the end.So it was a mad love.<br />         <br />          Now which is better-a matured love,love at first<br />          sight,blind love,love for purpose,or love the extends<br />          to generations.<br />          Not only Mandhahini, Pooonguzhali & Vanathi would have<br />          sacrificed their lives for their love and would have<br />          shown kindness to their children.&#40;I think so!&#41;<br />         <br />          But there is onething-the love of Nandhini for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It<br />          is not insisted much.yet it made me think - Nandhini<br />          form her childhood wanted power & wealth and was<br />          making moves to get that.Yet she lost her heart to<br />          <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.Her psoition was critical-she wanted to take<br />          revenge,restore Padyas to power,Kill Karikalan--yet<br />          she had a love which could never be expressed and<br />          which would never be accepted.But I know that there&#39;ll<br />          be contradictions whether she loved <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> or not.<br />         <br />          Among all I find love of Kundhavai & Nandhini to<br />          <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>,because they considered love to be an important<br />          part of life-yet a part of life.It is the practical<br />          way too.<br />         <br />          Regarding changing the title-<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is better.Even there<br />          came a &#39;thodar&#39;in Kalki titled <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> which explained the<br />          life of Kalki.So kaliki is <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.I welcome discussions on<br />          other novels also.<br />         <br />          yours<br />          Im.Lakshmi<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Thank you fiends for all your participation and commentsÂ…<br />         <br />          Sridhar<br />         <br />         <br />         <br />         <br />          Regards<br />          Sri<br />         <br />          ragavadacri ragavadacri@ wrote: <br />        Dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> fans,<br />         <br />          I am also an &#39;adimai&#39;

While reading I felt all through the<br />            novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />           <br />            Poonguzhali&#39;s towards Arulmozhi: I didn&#39;t feel like<br />            poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />            of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />           <br />            Nandhini&#39;s towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />            selfish love. When she knows that she won&#39;t be able to<br />            get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />            "You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />            about!!!!"<br />           <br />            Vanadhi&#39;s towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai&#39;s towards<br />            VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />           <br />            Generally positions and throne and all won&#39;t matter<br />            much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />            beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />            pattamagishi or not, it wudn&#39;t impact much since<br />            anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />            that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />            Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />           <br />            Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini&#39;s is<br />            selfless and great. But still eventhough she hadn&#39;t<br />            been living with Sundara Chola throughout her lifetime<br />            atleast she had been with him for somedays, loved him<br />            and been loved by him. For that love, she cud have<br />            sacrificed and saved Sudara and his son.<br />           <br />            But in case of Manimegalai, she has been really<br />            selfless to sacrifice even her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> not knowing<br />            for sure whether he loves her or not..<br />           <br />            Manimegalai tops the rating!!!!!!!!!!<br />           <br />            Cheers,<br />            Sathya<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            sridhar rathinam sridhar_rathinam@y...<br />            Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 12:44 am<br />            Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the <br />greatest <br />    Love?<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            Thanks Ram and Sathya..<br />           <br />            That was interesting..i agree with you..Manthagini and<br />          Manimegalai in that order.Manthagini inspite of her being <br />    wronged<br />          still does everything for her beloved..Kalki really <br />potrays <br />  her <br />    true<br />          love so well...especially in the scenes where she dots <br />  around <br />    Arun<br />          mozhi varman.....<br />           <br />            No wonder they immortalised her by making her a Goddess <br />  even<br />          today there is a Temple for the SingalaNachi Amman in <br />  Thanjavur <br />    OFF<br />          Medical College road which allegedly was built for <br />  Mandhakini by<br />          Arunmozhi....<br />           <br />            Manimegalai had all the sweet innocence and sacrifices <br />    everything<br />          for her love..well whether manimegalai would have loved<br />      Vandhiyadevan<br />          inspite of his betrayal...Mm well she knows he didnt love <br />  her <br />    and<br />          used her with his seettalk to get near Karikalan she <br />  forgives <br />    him<br />      and<br />          loves him so I m sure She would have done the same...True <br />  love<br />      always<br />          does it.<br />           <br />            Nandhini...well did she really love one person atleast<br />          truely...that&#39;s the question which Kalki leaves us <br />with..but <br />  she<br />          constantly does keep reminding Karikalan of her love..even <br />    before<br />      his<br />          death..<br />           <br />            Kunthavai..the potrayal of her charecter is so high that <br />  she<br />          never reveals her love or mental urmaoil..Infact in the <br />  whole <br />    series<br />          there would be tears in her eyes only on a few occasions...<br />           <br />            Vanathi what starts as an innocent love later becomes<br />          mature....she even dares to attain gajendra motcham for <br />    Arunmozhi..<br />           <br />            Pongulali...well it aws just a sort of <br />  Infactuation...crush <br />    sort<br />          of thing..<br />           <br />            The importnat tHing about Kalki is people and their <br />  attitute<br />          changes from Time to ..I found it hard to beleive as <br />normal <br />    when I<br />          first read it in sixth standard&#40;and hve read it almost <br />every <br />    year<br />          during the final exams a great stress releiver&#41; but as I <br />  have <br />    grown<br />          older..

But as a princess, she <br />  has to<br />          be. When taking<br />            kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of <br />  things. A<br />          princess of a<br />            big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, <br />    actually,<br />            falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy <br />is. <br />  If <br />    you<br />          look at the<br />            way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and <br />  helps <br />    the<br />          love to grow<br />            between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she <br />  wanted <br />    to<br />          be in Chozha<br />            nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she <br />    needn&#39;t<br />            have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in <br />  the <br />    4th<br />          bagam if I am<br />            right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything <br />else <br />  in <br />    her<br />          life. She<br />            knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and <br />  for <br />    that<br />          what she can<br />            expect in return. She is pretty clear.<br />           <br />            * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />           <br />            She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. <br />We <br />    have<br />          to keep that in<br />            mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and <br />  she<br />          takes a wow that<br />            she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi&#40;pm&#41;. <br />  As <br />    Ram<br />          aptly puts it,<br />            the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />            harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />           <br />            * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />           <br />            As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually <br />    falls in<br />          love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />            from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she <br />  loves <br />    her<br />          brother so<br />            much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her <br />brother&#41; <br />  has<br />          been<br />            instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, <br />its <br />    because<br />          she<br />            realizes that all that her brother had projected about <br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />  is<br />          wrong that she<br />            goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux <br />situation <br />    where<br />          she loves this<br />            guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a<br />          conflicting version and<br />            then she realizes something else. And in the end, <br />  everything<br />            goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to <br />  pieces. <br />    Its<br />          fate that<br />            plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />with <br />  the<br />          love she has for<br />            <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to <br />  her<br />          brother, I doubt<br />            she would have acted the way she did. That&#39;s not in her<br />          character.<br />           <br />            * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />           <br />            Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is <br />classic <br />    example<br />          of leaf who<br />            is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants <br />as <br />  and<br />          when she wants to<br />            just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I <br />doubt <br />  if <br />    she<br />          herself knows<br />            what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is <br />power. <br />  In<br />            the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries <br />using <br />  <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />          seeing how strong<br />            his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall <br />  for <br />    <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />          But in the end<br />            she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat <br />elsewhere. <br />  But <br />    she<br />          did have a<br />            lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar <br />  though<br />            again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of <br />people<br />          including Ravidasan.<br />           <br />            * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />           <br />            She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be <br />have <br />    lost<br />          his way. So all<br />            she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s <br />  another<br />          love at first<br />            sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy <br />from <br />  a<br />          bear. She is an<br />            exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 <br />  years. <br />    Roams<br />            around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief <br />  and<br />          disappointment in<br />            life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />predominant <br />    above<br />          everything<br />            else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She <br />  keeps<br />          roaming around SC<br />            and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves <br />AM <br />    many a<br />            time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses <br />  her <br />    life<br />          in the process<br />            of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />character <br />  who<br />          cant be compared<br />            to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her <br />love <br />  with<br />          anyone&#39;s for as<br />            I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life <br />was<br />            dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br />           <br />            * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />           <br />            This is another beautiful love that did not live long. <br />She<br />          realized that there<br />            was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />  never <br />    get<br />          fulfilled.<br />            Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the <br />  love<br />          that Sendhan<br />            Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise <br />decision <br />    both<br />          for<br />            herself and for AM.<br />           <br />           <br />            Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we <br />  would<br />          say it was<br />            Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. <br />And <br />  she<br />          died in the<br />            process of saving his life.<br />           <br />            But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl <br />  can <br />    give<br />          &#40;she too has<br />            plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things <br />accordingly <br />  and<br />          handling things<br />            accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself <br />  and <br />    is<br />          clear in what<br />            she wants and what she can give. She is not interested <br />in <br />    going<br />            about for something that she knows may not bear fruit <br />and <br />    waste<br />          her time on it.<br />            I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own <br />  life<br />          happy rather than<br />            creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That <br />  way, I<br />          would rate<br />            Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second.<br />           <br />            I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called <br />  Fountain<br />          Head by Any<br />            Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover <br />at a<br />          particular place,<br />            that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I love you&#39; <br />you<br />          cannot understand<br />            what it actually means to love another person. That way, <br />I <br />    feel<br />          both<br />            Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well <br />and<br />          emphatically.<br />           <br />            To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself <br />well <br />  and<br />          both you and<br />            your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that <br />love. <br />    That<br />          way I feel the<br />            only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and <br />    Kundhavai.<br />          And both do<br />            not expect anything in return for their love. They are <br />  happy <br />    and<br />            they make their loved ones happy too.<br />           <br />            My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />           <br />            thanks,<br />            Vidya.<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            Pavithra Srinivasan" pavithrasri@h...<br />            Date: Fri Oct 18, 2002 1:10 pm<br />            Subject: RE: Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            Bravo!

love.She was<br />            greatly impressed by <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It was his &#39;character&#39; that<br />            made her love him.He had all qualifications she<br />            expected like someone who would stay with in Chola<br />            empire..But She was not &#39;just a princess&#39;.She was a<br />            very important person who was involved in<br />            administration,whose opnions were greatly valued.When<br />            <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> was imprisoned she could not cry like<br />            Manimekalai.She carefully handled the kingdom,the<br />            politics,her brother,her father and also her love.Her<br />            love was not &#39;the most important&#39; in her view.Yet she<br />            wouldn&#39;t have loved anyone else too.<br />            So she was first a princess and then a lover.<br />           <br />            Poonkullai loved Arulmolli as people of chola kingdom<br />            did.It was not true love-she admired him,liked him but<br />            was not sure whether she wanted to live in a palace or<br />            not.She realised the true love of Senthan AMuthan and<br />            reciprocated to it.It was Senthan Amuthan&#39;s love that<br />            made her love him.So her love becomes a deeper one.<br />           <br />            Vanathi&#39;s love...she loved Arul Molli varmar and not<br />            Rajarajachola&#40;i.e the king&#41;.Her love was love at first<br />            sight.She would do anything for Arulmozhivarmar.<br />           <br />            Nandhini&#39;s love for Karikalan...it&#39;s not true love.She<br />            wanted to be rich,to be a queen and that made her love<br />            him.It was clearly a love for purpose.<br />           <br />            Mandhahini and her father only lived in that<br />            island.Imagine Mandhahini alone in a island meets a<br />            handsome stranger who loves her even when he knows she<br />            is dumb.So naturally she loved him.Her life was filled<br />            with joy when she was with Sundara Chola.So he is the<br />            only one she loved forever.Her love had no bounds.It&#39;s<br />            well expressed in the story.She was a noble character.<br />           <br />            Manimekalai&#39;s love was blind.From the words of her<br />            brother she started loving <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.She really didn&#39;t know<br />            much about him.It was her imaginations that made her<br />            love him.Even it is her imagination the made her<br />            mentally disturbed in the end.So it was a mad love.<br />           <br />            Now which is better-a matured love,love at first<br />            sight,blind love,love for purpose,or love the extends<br />            to generations.<br />            Not only Mandhahini, Pooonguzhali & Vanathi would have<br />            sacrificed their lives for their love and would have<br />            shown kindness to their children.&#40;I think so!&#41;<br />           <br />            But there is onething-the love of Nandhini for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It<br />            is not insisted much.yet it made me think - Nandhini<br />            form her childhood wanted power & wealth and was<br />            making moves to get that.Yet she lost her heart to<br />            <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.Her psoition was critical-she wanted to take<br />            revenge,restore Padyas to power,Kill Karikalan--yet<br />            she had a love which could never be expressed and<br />            which would never be accepted.But I know that there&#39;ll<br />            be contradictions whether she loved <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> or not.<br />           <br />            Among all I find love of Kundhavai & Nandhini to<br />            <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>,because they considered love to be an important<br />            part of life-yet a part of life.It is the practical<br />            way too.<br />           <br />            Regarding changing the title-<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is better.Even there<br />            came a &#39;thodar&#39;in Kalki titled <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> which explained the<br />            life of Kalki.So kaliki is <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.I welcome discussions on<br />            other novels also.<br />           <br />            yours<br />            Im.Lakshmi<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            Thank you fiends for all your participation and commentsÂ…<br />           <br />            Sridhar<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            Regards<br />            Sri<br />           <br />            ragavadacri ragavadacri@ wrote: <br />          Dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> fans,<br />           <br />            I am also an &#39;adimai&#39;
