			<div class="content">Links given below will give some information on the National Mission for<br />Manuscripts. There was a flurry of activity in 2003/04, and manuscripts<br />numbering in laks from Karnataka, Gujarat (maximum) and other states<br />were identified from individuals for digitization. But now, there is not<br />much news about its activities. Even the web sites are not updated. The<br />most recent news I have seen, (last week), the National Centre for<br />Performing Arts, the body entrusted with the project, froze distribution<br />of funds to the manuscript mission, citing mal practices in withdrawal<br />and spending. Let that be.<br /><br />In the early days, there was tremendous response, and teams visited a<br />large number of villages/towns and collected manuscripts from<br />individuals for digitization. They were overwhelmed by the quantity of<br />manuscripts available, all over India. The momentum slackened and there<br />was no publicity after some time. Not sure, how the manuscripts<br />collected and digitized will be made available with proper indexing and<br />search facility. I doubt whether the mission can mange this, with its<br />inertia, availability of domain specific experts and facilities.<br /><br />My only sore issue is: our inability to have the evidence in a decoded<br />printed format in our hands, is no justification to question our<br />forefather's lack of historical sense and make fun of them. People like<br />Madan who reach a wider reading public, must be sensitive about this.<br /><br />Unless the documents are available to a large group of committed and<br />devout researchers for study and deciphering, what ever is collected may<br />also be lost. Only IT savvy youngsters like in this group, can find a<br />solution for this 'himalayan' problem.<br />Sampath<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/">http://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://namami.nic.in/mission.htm">http://namami.nic.in/mission.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>VK and others,<br /> <br />  There is every possibility that there can be valuable resources<br />  hidden in some private collection, but practically speaking its<br />  impossible.<br /> <br />  From: my understanding, its very difficult to preserve palm leaf,<br />  without proper maintenance, it will crumble to pieces in a few<br />  years.

			<div class="content">hi;<br />just remembered something. A couple of weeks backmy father and i went to<br />Udayalur agrahaaram for a period of 2 days. We visited most of the<br />agrahaaram houses there. In one of the houses i saw a big bunch of really<br />really old palm leaves. The owner is living in Chennai so the house is<br />uninhabitated. The palm leaves were quite dusty and the owner said it<br />contained Ramayana. It was really old. The other houses are also really old<br />so im suer there must such leaves in the other homes. There must such leaves<br />in other houses too. Maybe we can scan them then and there.
