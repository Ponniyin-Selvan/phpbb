Kundavai was the right choice, because for her character she<br />will not leave the royal palace of chola's even after marriage.

			<div class="content">Thanks Satish. I definitely disagree on Pooguzhali, seems like a <br />classic male comment, apologies <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> but you cant have the cake and eat <br />it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we extend <br />into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen later <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman often <br />times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always nadagam. Also <br />many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not take <br />them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we dont' know <br />what she is upto and definitely not queen material.<br /><br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> I agree with every word although we have to see the innocence at <br />times behind the sapattu raman and skirt lover <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Diwakars quotable quotes &#40;as far as I can remember&#41;.
