			<div class="content">welcome - further reading Udayar portrays Sembian Madevi as dying <br />just as <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> does Boomi pooja for the big temple ---as already <br />discussed based on this she died between <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> ascending the throne <br />984 and 989 ( <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> ascension 1014 - approx 26 years for building big <br />temple)....it think there are more evidences of her surviving till <br />atleast 1000-1001. quoting sps ...Sembian Madevi constructed <br />Thiruvakkarai temple and the Vakkarakali is<br />dated around 1001 AD...<br /><br />regarding her husband - Gandaraditya - he was also known as <br />Merkelundarulina devar - read on....<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freehomepages.com/tamil-arts/volume2/articles/jain-">http://www.freehomepages.com/tamil-arts ... cles/jain-</a><!-- m --><br />temple.html<br /><br />The Gangas of Talakkadu were great patrons of Jainism. One of the <br />Ganga rulers with the title Prithvipati II was a contemporary of <br />Parantaka Chola I. He figures in a copper plate of Parantaka Chola <br />dated 931 CE. He also had the title Hastimalla. It is not unlikely <br />he obtained the name Hastimalla from the Jaina acarya who also had <br />the title Hastimalla. The Jaina acarya Hastimalla had a son named <br />Prati-vadi-malla who figures as the last Acharya of the first part <br />of the text Pratishta tilaka. The two Acaryas Hastimalla and Prati-<br />vadi-malla were contemporaries of Parantaka Chola I. The next acarya <br />mentioned by Nemicandra is Lokapalacarya. He must have been a <br />contemporary of ParantakaÃ¢Â€Â™s son.<br /><br /><br />This information is corroborated by inscription in an extraordinary <br />manner. ParantakaÃ¢Â€Â™s son Gandaraditya is mentioned in inscriptions <br />as "The Chola who went to the West". He was celebrated as Sivajnana-<br />cemmal a great Siva bhakta and one of the sacred hymns Thiruvisaippa <br />was sung by him. An inscription from Jambai in North Arcot district <br />is of interest in this regard. GandaradityaÃ¢Â€Â™s queen was the famous <br />Sembiyan mahadevi who renovated many Siva temples and consecrated <br />several Bronze images of exquisite beauty. Thus Gandaraditya was <br />known in the Saiva school as a great Saivite. However his title One <br />who went to the West is not explained though occurs often. As Jain <br />palli named Gandarditya perum Palli is mentioned it is not unlikely <br />he leaned towards Jainism at certain stage of his life. The <br />inscription reference to " One who went to the West" is confirmed by <br />this text which says that the Chola king went to the West with the <br />Jain teacher, Loka-pala-acarya. It was not known that what the term <br />meant. It is seen from this text that the west is mentioned as West <br />that is "Karnata desa". It is thus clear that Loka-pala-acarya went <br />to Karnata desa with Gandarditya Chola that is in the middle of the <br />10th cent<br /><br />....the whole dynasty seem bent in contriving situations to perplex <br />later historians...<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Shobha Ramakrishnan <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Thanks VJ for clearing Sembian Maadevi based on <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym>.

with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> as <br />      generals possibly&#41;, built a lot of temples, converted a lot of <br />    brick <br />      temples to stone n other related endowments&#40; would have <br />provided <br />      lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government <br />  was <br />      responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression. <br />  If <br />      the government increases its spending, then the citizens are <br />      encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation. <br />      People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb <br />  back <br />    up <br />      to normal.&#41; Despite all this he had to give up his throne <br />after <br />  15 <br />      years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes <br />  to <br />    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />      line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved <br />      something...or was it a compromise formula reached between <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> <br />  and <br />      Uttama.<br />      <br />      3&#41;

			<div class="content">Hi all<br /><br />All said and done, I dont believe <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> could have committed such heinous crime of killing his own brother. I do not believe Sembian Madevi would have done so too.<br /><br />Pandiya or Pallava angle cannot be dismissed. I have always been suspicious of Pallava parthibendra.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br /><br /><br />Rahul dhinakaran  wrote: Hi Madhu;<br /><br />Super conspiracy theory. Ive already bought this up and this theory has been trashed by this group. Im also of the opinion <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the ONLY person in that koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew he could get away with it.<br />We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a saint but there was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja" with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>still alive. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had been alive. Of all the motives <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s and Nandhini's seem the most probable. But Nandhini was present when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered and she is not that stupid!! That eliminates her. By the process of elimination <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the culprit. Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually thrashed by historians.<br />I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group. This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />There is no evidence on how <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br />On 7/20/07, Madhu Saravana Sibi Govindan  wrote: I'm very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed here before:<br />could <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK? He had everything to<br />gain from the murder. He could get a good name by appointing/letting others<br />appoint Uttama, thereby diverting attention from him. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> also knew that Uttama<br />would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he wanted. Later on, when <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym><br />came to power, he punished a few suspicious characters like Ravidasan.<br /><br />Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as portrayed by Kalki. But, is it<br />plausible? Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, who is shrewd and who could have<br />pulled off something like the plot above.<br /><br />What do others think?<br /><br />G.Sibi<br /><br /><br />On 7/18/07, kndavai  wrote:<br />Hey,<br />Actually some important politician or one of the family members may<br />invovled in this <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>murder.Surely RajaRaja did know the truth.But not<br />everyone in that period.<br /><br />So Rajaraja like to close this chapter without the knowledge of<br />others.If he published those information,he may thought it will be a<br />blackmark of cholas. People in that period also comes to conclusion<br />by guess only.Head of the kolaikara group might be silently punished<br />by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>.<br />This is the outer circle of the riddle.<br />Now you may guess some real characters who could get profit by Ak's<br />murder and we can filter from that.<br /><br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:nniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">nniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /><br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hi, spent half a day in higginbottams....its lost its past glory<br />and<br />  the attendants were no better than the peon at Madras Univ.. since<br />i<br />  live in singapore, connemara is out. have to scout in some of the<br />  local libraries here or on the net...vj<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Shobha Ramakrishnan<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    No not just to look for ans to AK&#39;s assasination.

Im also of the opinion <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the ONLY person in that<br />  koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew<br />  he could get away with it.<br />  We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a saint but there<br />  was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had<br />  to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja"<br />  with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>still alive. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had<br />  been alive. Of all the motives <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>&#39;s and Nandhini&#39;s seem the most probable.<br />  But Nandhini was present when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered and she is not that stupid!!<br />  That eliminates her. By the process of elimination <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the culprit.<br />  Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually<br />  thrashed by historians.<br />  I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group.<br />  This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />  There is no evidence on how <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate<br />  <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /> <br />  Regards<br />  Rahul<br /> <br /> <br />  On 7/20/07, Madhu Saravana Sibi Govindan  wrote:<br />  I&#39;m very sure the following hypothesis would<br />  have been discussed here before:<br />  could <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK? He had<br />  everything to<br />  gain from the murder. He could get a good name by appointing/letting others<br />  appoint Uttama, thereby diverting attention from him. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> also knew that<br />  Uttama<br />  would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he wanted. Later<br />  on, when <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym><br />  came to power, he punished a few suspicious characters like Ravidasan.<br /> <br />  Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as portrayed by<br />  Kalki.

Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, who is<br />  shrewd and who could have<br />  pulled off something like the plot above.<br /> <br />  What do others think?<br /> <br />  G.Sibi<br /> <br /> <br />  On 7/18/07, kndavai  wrote:<br /> <br />  Hey,<br />  Actually some important politician or one of the family members may<br />  invovled in this <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>murder.Surely RajaRaja did know the truth.But not<br />  everyone in that period.<br /> <br />  So Rajaraja like to close this chapter without the knowledge of<br />  others.If he published those information,he may thought it will be a<br />  blackmark of cholas.
