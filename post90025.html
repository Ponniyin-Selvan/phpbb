			<div class="content">Dear PSVP relatives<br /><br />orissa played role on kamboja kingdom through palur port<br /><br />palur was the major port for indian kingdom.<br /><br />kongoda mandala which banpur was the capital is 60 km from palura on <br />sailabodeva period, may be associate with pallava origins.<br /><br />Orissa sea traders are called saduvans/vyabaris even from 3 rd  <br />century BC<br /><br />having enough document in text from <br /><br />sending some sample here with ;<br /><br /><br />The Matharas <br /><br /> <br /><br />Soon after the invasion of Samudragupta a new ruling power named <br />Mathara raised its head in Kalinga. The earliest known Mathara king <br />was Vishakavarman who started his politial career as an humble ruler <br />of a small territory round about modern Parlakhemundi. He was <br />succeeded by Umavarman who declared himself as Lord of Kalinga by <br />his 30 th regnal year and made Singhapura his capital. He ruled for <br />about 35 years and was succeeded by Sankaravarman in about 395 A.D. <br />Maharaja Sankaravarman died after a short rule and was succeeded by <br />his son Maharaja Saktivarman in about 400 A.D. Saktivarman was a <br />powerful ruler who had extended his kingdom from Mahanadi in the <br />north to the river Krishna in the south. He transferred his capital <br />from Singhapura to Pishtapura in South Kalinga. He died in about 420 <br />A.D. and was succeeded by his son Anantasaktivarman who ruled up to <br />450 A.D. Anantasaktivarman could not maintain the integrity of the <br />empire inherited from his father. The Vishnukundin king <br />Madhavavarman occupied South Kalinga as a result of which <br />Anantasaktivarman shifted his headquarters from Pishtapura to <br />Singhapura.<br /><br />It appears that after the death of Saktivarman there was internal <br />quarrel between his two sons Anantasaktivarman and Prabhanjanavarman <br />which contributed to the weakness of the Mathara dynasty. <br />Anantasaktivarman was succeeded by Chandravarman who was probably <br />his son. He had a premature death after which Prabhanjanavarman, the <br />brother of Anantasaktivarman came to the throne. He attempted to <br />recover South Kalinga but could not succeed in bringing back the <br />lost territory. He was succeeded by Nandaprabhanjanaverman. During <br />his rule the Mathara power declined steadily. By that time the <br />Eastern Gangas appeared in the Trikalinga territory and extended <br />their power over the Kalinga Regions. The Mathara rule in Kalinga <br />ended in 498 A.D. which was the initial year of the Ganga era.<br /><br />The Eastern Gangas<br /><br />The earliest known Ganga king of Kalinga was Indravarman I whose <br />capital was located at Dantapura. He is said to have defeated the <br />Vishnukandin king Indrabhattaraka. He was the first great ruler of <br />the Ganga dynasty and started the Ganga era. His Jirajingi copper <br />plate grant was issued in Ganga year 39, i.e. 537 A.D. The next king <br />was Samantavarman whose grant is dated in the year 64 (562 A. D.). <br />Like his predecessor Samantavarman assumed the title of <br />Trikalingadhipati. He was succeeded by king Hastivarman who claims <br />to have defeated his enemies in many battles and declared himself <br />the Lord of all Kalingas (Sakala Kalinga). Hastivarman transferred <br />his capital from Dantapura to Kalinganagar. He was succeeded by his <br />son Indravarman II and the latter was succeeded by Indravarmanan III <br />who is known to be a powerful ruler. He claims to have acquired <br />proficiency in various sciences and arts. The next king was <br />Devendravarman who had mantradikshya from Patangashivacharya who was <br />learned in Veda, Vedanga, Itihasa and Puranas. He greatly patronized <br />Brahminical religion and culture. He was succeeded by his son <br />Hemantavarman I after whom his two sons Nandavarman and <br />Devendravarman II ruled over Kalinga one after the other. The next <br />important ruler of the family was Anantavarman II who did many works <br />of public benefit. He was succeeded by his brother Devendravarman <br />III who patronized a Brahmin poet (the name is not known) who was <br />the son of the door-keeper of his palace. He was succeeded by his <br />son Anantavarman III and after his two of his sons Rajendravarman II <br />and Devendravarman IV became kings one after the other. The next <br />ruler was Satyavarman, son of Devendravarman, who was a war like <br />ruler. After his short rule his brother Anantavarman IV came to the <br />throne. He was popularly called Vajri or Vajrahasta I. The next <br />Ganga king was Maharaja Bhupendravarman. After his two sons <br />Anantavarman V and Devendravarman V ruled one after the other. <br />Anantavarman assumed the epithet Maharajadhiraja and was known as <br />Vajrahasta II.<br /><br /><br />The Nalas <br /><br /> <br /><br />Before the rise of the Eastern Gangs the Nala dynasty had <br />established a kingdom in Trikalinga region comprising parts of the <br />modern districts of Bastar, Koraput and Kalahandi. The capital of <br />the kingdom of the Nalas was at Pushkari. The Podagarh rock <br />inscription indicates that pushkari was situated close to the site <br />of Podagarh in Koraput district. The earliest known ruler of the <br />Nala dynasty was Vrishadhvaja who is known from a seal discovered at <br />Bhita. It is suggested that the seal was carried to Bhita when <br />Bhavadattavarman, the grandson of Vrishadhvaja, went on piligrimage <br />to Prayaga where he donated grants to Brahmins. The date of <br />Vishadhvaja may be fixed from circa 400 A.D. to 420 A.D. The next <br />king Varaharaja was probably the son of Vishadhvaja. He was a <br />powerful and independent ruler and had a prosperous reign. Out of 32 <br />gold coins of the Nala kings discovered at Edenga in Bastar <br />district, seven large size and twenty-two smaller size coins <br />belonged to Varaharaja. He had been assigned to the period from <br />circa 420 to 440 A.D.<br /><br />Bhavadattavarman also called Bhavadattaraja was probably the son and <br />successor of Varaharaja. During his rule there was conflict between <br />the Nalas and the Bhakatakas and Bhavadattavarman defeated the <br />Bhakataka king who has been identified with Narendrasena. The <br />Bhakatakas capital Nandivardhana was occupied by the Nalas. <br />Bhavadattavarman issued grants in favour of a Bhrahmin named <br />Matradhyarya and his eight sons when he was at Prayaga with his <br />queen. He was a powerful and a generous king. He was succeeded by <br />his son Arthapatiraja. The Bhakataka king Prithvisena II, son of <br />Narendrasena, defeated Arthapatiraja and ousted the Nalas from the <br />capital Nandivardhana. He invaded Pushkari, the Nala capital, and <br />destroyed it to a great extent. King Arthapati was probably killed <br />in the battle. About 480 A.D. Skandavarman, the brother of <br />Arthapatiraja, succeeded to the throne and restored the lost glory <br />and prosperity of the Nala kingdom. But after sometime the <br />Bhakatakas became very powerful under king Harisena who inflicted a <br />crushing defeat on the Nalas. The Eastern Gangas rose to power in <br />Trikalinga territory after the defeat and decline of the Nalas in <br />that region.<br /><br /><br />The Sailodbhavas <br /><br /> <br /><br />During the 6 th-7 th centuries A.D. a new dynasty called Sailodbhava <br />ruled its head in the coastal region of Orissa extending from <br />Mahanadi in the north to the Mahendragiri in the south. The <br />territory was known as Kangoda mandala. The earliest known ruler of <br />this dynasty was Sailodbhava who is described in the copper plate <br />charters of the family as born out of rocks. After him Ranabhita <br />also known as Dharmaraja I became the ruler. He was a feudatory <br />chief under Prithvivigraha, the king of Kalinga Rastra.<br /><br />Dharmaraja I Ranabhita was succeeded by his son Madhavaraja I also <br />called Sainyabhita I. He was probably a feudatory of the Vigraha <br />king Lokavigraha. He was succeeded by Ayasobhita I alias <br />Chharamparaja. During his rule the polital condition of Orissa was <br />extremely chaotic because of the struggle between the Vigrahas and <br />the Mudgalas and after the defeat of the Vigrahas the conflict <br />between the Durjayas and the Mudgalas and subsequently the advent of <br />Sasanka to the political scene of Orissa. Taking advantage of the <br />political situation Chharamparaja assumed independence but his son <br />and successor Madhavaraja II became a feudatory chief under Sasanka. <br />It appears that Sasanka conquered Kangoda about the year 615 A.D. <br />when Madhavaraja II succeeded his father. The Ganjam grant of <br />Madhavaraja issued in 620 A.D. declared him as a Mahasamanta of <br />Sasanka who was by that time the overlord of Dandabhukti, Utkal as <br />well as Kangoda. But by the time his undated Khordha grant was <br />issued, Madhavaraja was an independent monarch and in that charter <br />he called himself the Lord of entire Kalinga. In the Purushottampur <br />grant issued in his 13 th regnal year Madhavaraja is described as <br />the performer of a horse sacrifice and many other Vedic rites. From <br />that time onwards he called himself Madhavavarman instead of <br />Madhavaraja. By that time Harshavaradhana occupied Dandabhukti and <br />Utkal and was making preparation to take possession of Kalinga and <br />Kangoda. In the south the political power of the Chalukya king <br />Pulakesin II extended up to the river Vansadhara which was flowing <br />in the heart of Kalinga. The rivalry between Harshavardhana and <br />Pulakesin helped Madhavavarman to maintain his independence. The <br />situation did not change even after the defeat of Harsha by <br />Pulakesin sometime before 634 A.D. but after the death of Pulakisin <br />II in 642 A.D. the Chalukya power declined suddenly and Kangoda was <br />occupied by Harshavardhana. Madhavavarman became the feudatory of <br />Harshavardhana till 647 A.D. when Harsha died. Soon after that he <br />again became independent. When he issued the Cuttack Museum plates <br />in his 50 th regnal year we find him as a sovereign ruler of <br />prosperous kingdom. He died about 665 A.D. and was succeeded by his <br />son Madhyamaraja I also known as Ayasobhita II. The Parikud charter <br />issued in his 26 th regnal year describes Madhyamaraja as a mystic <br />person capable of talking with dead souls and as a strong man <br />capable of running with two stout persons standing on his shoulders. <br />He also performed Vedic sacrifices like Vajapeya and Asvamedha.<br /><br />After the death of Madhyamaraja there was a war of succession <br />between his two sons Dharmaraja and Madhavaraja. Madhavaraja was <br />defeated in the battle of Phasika and Dharmaraja obtained the throne <br />and performed his coronation. Madhava got the support of Tivaradeva, <br />the powerful ruler of the South Kosala, and invaded Kangoda but the <br />combined army of Madhava and Tivaradeva was defeated by Dharmaraja. <br />Dharmaraja II was a powerful monarch and performed Vedic rites and <br />sacrifices. His Queen Kalyana Devi patronized the cause of Jainism. <br />He granted lands to Pravodhachandra, the disciple of Nasichandra, to <br />promote Jainism in Kangoda.<br /><br />After Dharmaraja II the power of the Sailodbhavas suddenly declined. <br />Dharamaraja was succeeded by his son Madhyamaraja II. It was <br />probably during his rule that the Sailodbhavas were driven out of <br />Kangoda by the Bhaumas. Allaparaja who succeeded Madhyamaraja II was <br />crowned as king outside Kangoda in the territory of the Eastern <br />Gangas. He is described as the son of the uncle of Madhyamaraja II. <br />He was succeeded by his grandson Madhyamaraja III. But nothing is <br />known about the Sailodbhavas after that ruler.<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sivaram Kannan" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A very interesting article in young world about the link Combodia <br />and<br />  Kanchipuram<br />  had.<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/yw/2007/03/16/stories/2007031600500200.htm">http://www.hindu.com/yw/2007/03/16/stor ... 500200.htm</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  <br />  -- <br />  with luv & regards,<br />  siva<br />  <br />  ever tried. ever failed. no matter.<br />  try again. fail again. fail better.<br />  -- Samuel Beckett<br />  <br />  Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com</div></blockquote></div>
