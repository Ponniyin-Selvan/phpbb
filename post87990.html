			<div class="content">Hi SPS sir & group,<br /><br />Two months back i got chance to visit Vanivilas dam, Chitradurga<br />fort and hampi..we missed badami <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br />I will upload few photos and send across the link..but before..though<br />will share the details we generated during the visit.<br /><br />Hampi is marevelous place to visit. Land of granites and pillars.<br /><br />Hotels are there at Hospet which is some 7 kms before hampi. <br /><br />Details are :<br /><br />The Drive from Bangalore to Hampi<br />---------------------------------<br />The drive from Bangalore to Hampi is a pleasant one. You start off on<br />NH 4 and continue driving on it till Chitradurga. A right turn just<br />after Chitradurga gets you onto NH 13 that runs from there to<br />Sholapur. NH 13 is very sparsely populated with an odd truck or tempo,<br />the road surfaces though aren't as good as NH 4 but are pretty okay.<br />Watch out for farmers spreading their crops across the roads though<br />From: Hospet to Badami the route gets onto state highways after<br />Hungund. Driving on these roads needs caution as they are very narrow.<br />The road surfaces though are exceptionally good. In Badami the streets<br />are very narrow and a large SUV may have trouble getting through.<br /><br /><br />Places of Interest in Chitradurga (200 Kms (NH4))<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />Chitradurga Fort<br />-----------------<br />The Historic Fort is a marvel of military architecture that made it<br />impregnable by the Nayak PaLayagars. It has 19 gateways, 38 posterior<br />entrances, a palace, a mosque, granaries, oil pits, four secret<br />entrances and water tanks. Amidst rocky surroundings inside the fort<br />complex on the hill are many temples. It is on a hilltop with a good<br />view of the surrounding plains. The place is renowned for its Kallina<br />Kote ("the place of the stone fort"), and is home to the "Fort of<br />Seven Rounds" (??? ??????? ????), built with large stones. In the hill<br />fort there are temples of the Sampige Siddeshwara, Hidimbeshwara (a<br />cave shrine), Ekanathamma, Phalguneshwara, Gopalakrishan etc., amidst<br />thick rocky surroundings.<br />	<br />Obavvana Kindi (The crack)<br />---------------------<br />During the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the city of Chitradurga was<br />besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali. A chance sighting of a woman<br />entering the Chitradurga fort through a crack hole in the rocks led to<br />a clever plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through the crack<br />hole. The defense guard on duty of the port near that crack hole had<br />just gone home as usual asking his wife to guard till he is back from<br />his lunch. The wife of that guard, Obavva while in her temporary seat,<br />noticed the soldiers emerging out of this crack, Obavva was not<br />perturbed. As she was carrying with her, the Onake (a wooden long club<br />meant for pounding paddy grains) she killed and quietly moved the<br />dead, so that hundreds of them entered and fell, without raising any<br />suspicion. The guard, Obavva's husband, upon his return from his lunch<br />was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and<br />hundreds of dead bodies of the enemy fleet around her. The passage<br />still remains as a historical witness for the story, beside the<br />Tanniru DoNi -a small water source which holds cold water all round<br />the year. Though her sincere brave attempt saved the fort this time,<br />Madakari could not resist the attack of 1799 by Hyder Ali. The fort of<br />Chitradurga was lost for Hyder Ali once for all.    <br /> <br />Vaani Vilas Sagara:  <br />---------------------<br />It is also called Mari Kanive is a dam near Hiriyur Taluk,<br />Chitradurga District, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the<br />oldest dam in the state.The dam was built by the Mysore Maharajas<br />pre-independence across the river Vedavathi. The dam is an exquisite<br />piece of architecture, an engineering marvel for that time, and<br />provides water to lots of surrounding cities, towns and villages,<br />which are largely dry lands of the Deccan area of Central Karnataka.<br />This dam is the source of domestic water for Hiriyur and Chitradurga.<br />It irrigates more than 100 km? of land in Hiriyur and Challakere<br />taluks through right and left bank canals. The dam was constructed by<br />a team led by an Engineer called 'Tara Chand Dalal' at the order of<br />his Highness the Maharaja of Mysore Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV<br />The dam has been a tourist attraction for many years, but has been<br />apparently neglected as a prime tourist destination. Recently, though,<br />the development work undertaken by the forest department to restore<br />the nearby forest cover, and the 'panchavati' gardens - a garden of<br />medicinal plants with the old Indian cultural theme has improved the<br />tourist figures, making it a popular weekend picnic spot. The<br />'panchavati' garden has medicinal plants lined up representing<br />cultural themes - the 'Rashis', 'Sapta swaras', 'Nava grahas' and many<br />more. The tourists who visit Chitradurga and Hosdurga often visit Mari<br />kanive on the way. The historic Maarikaamba temple here also attracts<br />many tourists. The place is around 20 Km drive from Hiriyur on a<br />deviation from NH4 (Bangalore -Pune National Highway).<br /> <br />Murugha Rajendra Bruhanmatha<br />------------------------------<br />The first Murugha Rajendra Mutha at Chitradurga was built on the<br />Chinmuladri hills by Palegar Bichugatti Bharamanna Nayaka for Guru<br />Shanthaveera Swamiji of the 8th Pontiff of Murugha tradition. Later it<br />was shifted to the present mutt in 1703 AD which is situated at the<br />left side of Chitradurga - Davanagere road near M.K. Hatti. Now the<br />27th Pontiff of the order Sri Shivamurthy Murugha Rajendra Sharanaru<br />prerides over the muth. The muth is engaged in propagating<br />Basavadharma. It runs Schools, Colleges, Hostels, Orphanage , Free<br />food homes, apart from organizing religious, Social and Cultural<br />function. It arranges mass marriage, widow remarriages, intercaste<br />marriages for the benefit of people. The Murugha Vana in the premises<br />of the mutt is a beautiful botanical garden.<br /> <br />Chandravalli Gardens<br />------------------------------<br />Chandravalli is an ancient Historical site situated in the western<br />part of the Chinmuladri hills. A motorable road to the left on<br />Chitradurga - Holalkere high way leads us to Chandravalli Valley.<br />Archaelogical discoveries made in the Ankali Mutha are found here. The<br />sites of Historical excavation, Tiger boulder, Siddeshwara temple,<br />Ankli Mutha, Panchalingeswara Cave Temple, Dhavalappanagudda and the<br />Chandravalli Lake are the worth seeing place here.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Places of Interest in HAMPI<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />AchyutaRaya Temple<br />-----------------------<br />This temple can be reached either from Kodanda Rama Temple through<br />the Bazaar wrongly called "Soolai Bazaar" or "Courtesan Street" or<br />from the Virupaksha Bazaar by climbing the steps next to the<br />monolithic Nandi at the end of the bazaar. Achyutaraya Temple is a<br />large complex built by an officer of the King Achyutaraya, Salakaraju<br />Tirumaladeva. This temple is better known as Achyutaraya temple, in<br />whose period it was built rather than the name of the deity<br />"Tiruvengalanatha" or Lord Venkateshwara.<br /> <br />Stone Chariot<br />-----------------------<br />Though inside the Vijayavittala Temple complex, the Stone Chariot<br />gets our special attention because it deserves. One will fall short of<br />words if he/she tries to describe the beauty of this wonderful<br />man-made piece of art. Situated to the east of the hall, Stone chariot<br />has stone wheels which some believe actually rotate. We have not<br />tested it tough. <br />The chariot is a miniature temple. Though some believe it is carved<br />out of a single rock, it is not the case. It resembles the temple<br />chariots or rathas in which the idols of the temple are taken out on a<br />traditional procession. <br /><br />Shri Vijayavitthala Temple<br />---------------------------<br />If one wants to witness the competition between man and Vishwakarma<br />(the Architect God of Hindus), this is the place on earth. Any number<br />of words would fail to do justice to this wonderful monument dedicated<br />to Lord Vitthala or Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that Lord Vishnu found<br />it too grand to live in and thus returned to his own humble home. The<br />Stone Chariot is situated to the east of the temple hall. By far, this<br />is the most amazing monument in Hampi and is portrayed as the icon for<br />Hampi.<br />The construction of this temple started during the reign of King<br />Krishna Deva Raya in the year 1513 AD. The project was so colossal<br />that the additions continued for almost five decades until the Empire<br />fell down in the year 1565 AD.<br />Built mainly on the original Drividian Temple architecture, this<br />temple has all the stuff a typical South Indian temple would have.<br />There is small a main inner sanctum where the deity idol(s) are<br />placed. Only the chief priest of the temple is permitted inside this<br />sanctum. The smaller sanctum is followed by a bigger outer shrine<br />where the general public is allowed. The monumental decoration of the<br />temple can be seen mainly in this bigger outer house.  <br />The temple stands, within high walls with 3 gateways on the east,<br />south and north. The temple stands on a strong stone basement with<br />richly carved designs of the King's army and dancing girls. The<br />dancing halls and kalyanamantapas in the corners are equally worth<br />noticing.<br />The carvings on this temple give an insight into the architectural<br />splendour achieved by the artisans of Vijayanagara Empire. The temple<br />consists of 56 musical pillars. When tapped gently, these pillars<br />produce musical sounds. These pillars are popularly known as Musical<br />Pillars or SaReGaMa pillars after the Saptha Swaras of the Indian<br />Classical Music.<br />  <br />Reaching there  <br />Vitthala temple complex is situated 2 km east of Hampi Bazaar. There<br />are signs giving directions at frequent intervals which one can follow<br />to reach there.<br />  <br /><br />Hazari Rama Temple<br />-----------------------<br />This temple for Lord Rama is popularly called "Hazari Rama Temple" or<br />"Hazara Rama Temple" because of the large number of Ramayana panels on<br />the walls. This temple is believed to have been the private place of<br />worship of the Royal family.<br />Originally, the temple consisted of a sanctum, an ardha mantapa and a<br />pillared hall to which an open porch with tall and elegant pillars was<br />added subsequently. A high wall encloses the entire complex with the<br />main entrances set on the east. To the south is a small doorway, which<br />leads to the Durbar Area. The pillar hall is notable for its unique<br />pillars in black-stone. They are set on a raised stone platform in the<br />middle of the hall. The tall and elegant pillars of the open porch are<br />also worth a second look. The other structures in this temple complex<br />are a shrine for Devi and Utsava Mantapa.<br />As the name indicates, this temple is famous for its many Ramayana<br />panels. This is the only temple in Hampi where the exterior walls have<br />boldly chiselled bas-reliefs. These bas-reliefs are narrative in<br />nature. The Ramayana epic is carved in detail. Incidents in the story<br />like Dasaratha performing a sacrifice to beget sons, the birth of<br />Rama, his exile into the forest, the abduction of Sita and the<br />ultimate fight between Rama and Ravana are all carved in a vivid<br />manner. In these panels, the story of Rama and through it the triumph<br />of good over evil is brought out. The genesis of Hampi dates back to<br />the age Ramayana when it was the monkey kingdom Kishkindha.<br />This temple now unused is situated in the royal enclosure of the city<br />and was probably the king's private shrine. The enclosure walls of the<br />temple are exceptional in a way that they are both carved on the<br />outside as well as inside. The outer friezes depict horses, elephants,<br />dancing girls and infantry in procession; the inner panels show scenes<br />from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The enclosure wall also has panels<br />on the exterior side. The boldly carved panels are in five horizontal<br />rows, one above the other, representing a procession of elephants with<br />riders and attendants, prancing horses with riders and rider less<br />horses led by grooms, wrestlers and soldiers in procession witnessed<br />by a few seated royal figures. These panels represent symbolically the<br />power of the rulers and the might of their fighting forces paraded<br />annually at the time of the Dusshera festival.<br />On the wall of the god's sanctum are two rare depictions of Vishnu as<br />the Buddha. Though the temple is small it is a fine example of the<br />skill of Vijayanagara's sculptors. Only master craftsmen can coax<br />filigree and lace out of Deccan stone. <br /><br />Shri Virupaksha Temple<br />-----------------------<br />The Virupaksha temple is located at the foot of the hill called<br />Hemakuta Hill is the core of the village of Hampi. The temple, often<br />called Pampapathi temple, is the most sacred of the temples of this<br />place. Historically speaking, this temple has an uninterrupted history<br />from about the 7th century. The temple contains the shirines of Lord<br />Shiva, Pampa and Bhuvaneshwari. What was once a small shrine, in<br />course of time, developed into a large complex under the Vijayanagara<br />rulers. At present, the main temple consists of a Sanctum, three ante<br />chambers, a pillared hall and a Mukha Mantapa also called Ranga<br />Mantapa or an open pillared hall. A pillared cloister, entrance<br />gateways, courtyards, attendant shrines and other manttapas surround<br />the temple. In 1510 A.D. Krishnadevaraya added the above-mentioned<br />Ranga Mantapa.<br />The Ranga mantapa consists of 38 pillars, relieved with sculptures.<br />These pillars are divided into two vertical sections - the first is<br />cut to resemble a rearing Yali - a mythical lion, standing on a<br />Makara, while the second section is basically square with small<br />relief, depicting mostly Shaiva themes. These pillars are<br />aesthetically composed and skilfully constructed.<br />The central ceiling of the Ranga Mantapa is of substantial size. The<br />ceiling as well as the beams supporting the ceilings is covered with<br />painted panels. The panel depicts themes from the Mahabharatha, the<br />Ramayana and the Shiva Puranas as well as from the contemporary life.<br />Starting at the entrance of the temple is Virupaksha Bazaar or<br />market, largest of the many bazaars of Vijayanagara. Each major Temple<br />complex had its own bazaar around which a township developed. This is<br />the only bazaar around which a township of a sort still exists. This<br />bazaar is flanked by the main gopura of Virupaksha temple called<br />Bishtappa's gopura on the one end and the monolithic Nandi at the<br />other end. The 9 storied, 53 meters high gopura adds elegance to the<br />732 meters long and 28 meters wide Virupaksha Bazaar. <br />The other temple of significance in this complex is the shrine for<br />Goddess Bhuvaneshwari. This shrine was rebuilt in the Vijayanagara<br />days, over an 11th century temple. This temple is chiefly noted for<br />its marvelously worked door-frame, pillars and articulately chiseled<br />ceiling panels.<br /> <br />Ugra Narasimha<br />-----------------------<br />This image of Lakshmi-Narasimha, popularly called Ugranarasimha,<br />meaning Narasimha of terrifying countenance, is hewn out of a rock<br />in-situ. According to an inscription found here, it was executed in<br />1528 A.D. during the rule of Krishnadevaraya. Originally, the icon<br />bore a smaller image of Lakshmi sitting on his lap. This gigantic<br />image, 6.7 meters in height, was mutilated and the figure of Lakshmi<br />was entirely damaged and vandalized in 1565 A.D. Narasimha with an<br />articulately chiseled and well delineated mane and large bulging eyes<br />and broad chest still retains His awesome charm. He is seated on the<br />coils of the snake Adisesha, who rises behind him with seven hoods,<br />which serve as a canopy. The entire image is set within a Makara<br />torana, or arch, with a lion-mask above the hoods of Adisesha.<br />The statue of Lakshmi can now be found at Kamalapura Museum.<br />As mentioned above, the whole statue of Narasimha and Lakshmi was cut<br />in a single boulder. While other kingdoms further southwards used<br />Schist, a soft stone as the medium of their constructions, the<br />Sangamas decided to go in for granite as the building material for<br />their temples. The hard granite was available on the site in plenty<br />and was economic. Granite, being hard, was not suitable for the<br />delicate filigree work that could be carved on Schist. What the<br />artists had to sacrifice on the delicacy of the work was compensated<br />by the massiveness of the sculptures. The statue of Ugra Narasimha is<br />a perfect example of what they achieved in volume which they could not<br />in delicacy.<br /> <br />Water Channels<br />-----------------------<br />The Palace area is dotted with innumerable water tanks of various<br />sizes. In fact, the whole of Hampi ruins has very many water tanks.<br />All these tanks were supplied with water by a well-planned water<br />supply system.<br />Water from the Kamalapura tank feeds the main stone aqueduct running<br />east to West in the royal enclosure. First it feeds the large public<br />tank and then the stepped tank. Later the main stone aqueduct branches<br />off to North and West, which in turn feed nineteen other small and big<br />tanks all over the royal enclosure. At the point of branching off of<br />the main stone aqueduct, a well was dug to enable water supply in case<br />the water supply from Kamalapura tank ceased. The drain and waste<br />water from the royal enclosure was taken out through underground stone<br />slab-lime concrete drainage channels either directly or through a huge<br />drain found on the southern side adjoining the walled garden.<br />The major irrigation works of the Vijayanagara rulers include Raya<br />Canal, Basavanna Canal, Turthu Canal and the huge tank at Kamalapura.<br />These irrigation works are still in use.<br /> <br />Elephant Stable<br />-----------------------<br />Located outside the Zenana Enclosure, on the East, is an oblong<br />structure of considerable size, called the Elephant stables. Among the<br />many civil structures of the place, this building is a fine example of<br />Indo-Islamic style of architecture.<br />It has a greater Islamic character about it. The building consists of<br />eleven large rooms with very high ceilings. Large domes crown ten of<br />these. These domes are of brick and mortar, and are of different<br />shapes drum-shaped, ribbed and octagonal. The superstructure of the<br />central upper pavilion is lost. It probably had a Hindu Shikhara in<br />consonance with the Indo-Islamic architecture.<br />The rooms were used as Elephant stables. The elephants were tied to<br />the chairs hanging from the centre of the ceiling as can be made out<br />from the iron hooks embedded in some of the ceilings. These were not<br />the military elephants but were the ceremonial ones which were used by<br />royal household. Apart from the royal elephants, temples also had<br />elephants of their own to perform various pujas. One such elephant can<br />still be seen in Hampi.<br /><br />Prasanna Virupaksha Temple<br />--------------------------<br />More popularly known as Underground Virupaksha Temple, this is<br />situated to the west of the Danaik's Enclosure. A large broken loose<br />slab containing an inscription which records a grant to the temple of<br />Prasanna Virupaksha by King Krishna Deva Raya on the occasion of his<br />coronation.<br />The temple faces east and is much below the present ground level. The<br />temple is much dilapidated. The large and wide two-tiered gupura on<br />the east has no superstructure extant. The main sanctum has many axial<br />mantapas. The easternmost of these is a pillared seven-aisled<br />maha-mantapa with a tall and tapering dipa or dhwaja stambha<br />protruding through its roof top. To the north and south of the mantapa<br />are the remnants of corridor with pillars of the heavy early cubical<br />type as in Ganagitti Temple.<br />The floor of the maha mantapa, the other axial mantapas as well as<br />the main sanctum are under water. The maha-mantapa leads to the<br />three-aisled ardha-mantapa, the large cubical pillars of which are<br />also of an early type, with cubical base, octagonal shafts, a thin<br />pionted kumbha and large idol. The kalyana-mantapa at the south-west<br />corner of the temple is an ornate one in the typical Vijayanagara style.<br /> <br />Balakrishna Temple<br />--------------------<br />Krishnadevaraya built this temple in 1513 A.D. to commemorate his<br />victory over Prataparudra Gajapati, the ruler of Orissa. During the<br />battle he seized an image of child Krishna and brought it to<br />Vijayanagara as war trophy. He then built this temple to consecrate<br />the image. An inscription describing the conquest and the consecration<br />of this temple on 16 February 1515 by Krishnadevaraya is found on a<br />slab in front of this temple. Built in the centre of a courtyard, the<br />temple possesses a sanctum, an antechamber, an ardha mantapa, a<br />circumambulatory passage, a pillared hall with three entrances and an<br />open pillared mantapa, in addition to a number of other shrines for<br />the attendant deities. The sanctum is at present empty. The image of<br />Balakrishna showing him as a child holding butter in the right hand is<br />now resting in the Government Museum at Madras.<br />The inner sides of the entrance exhibit beautifully sculptured Apsaras<br />standing on mythical animals and holding scrolls filled with panels<br />showing the ten incarnations of the lord. Like all major temple<br />complexes, Krishnapura, a suburb, is developed around this temple. The<br />bazaar in front is now a lush paddy field.<br /><br />Stepped Tank<br />--------------------<br />One of the beautiful remains in the Durbar area is tile Stepped Tank<br />built in chlorite schist, used by the royals and for religious<br />purposes. The small but neat tank is about 22 square meters and about<br />7 meters deep. It has five distinct tiers, each fitted with steps set<br />in a pleasing pattern. The mason marks on the individual blocks<br />indicating the direction, the row and the location of the steps reveal<br />that the layout of this stepped tank was well thought out in advance<br />and all the different block stones were prepared in accordance with<br />the plan elsewhere and assembled on the site later. This tank was<br />discovered during the recent excavations.<br />A bigger tank measuring roughly 73 meters by 27 meters is at the<br />entrance into the Durbar area, and located to the Northwest of the<br />Queen's bath. The common people probably used this tank.<br /><br />Kadalekalu Ganesha Temple<br />-------------------------<br />On the slope of Hemakuta Hill, near the Sasivekalu Ganesha is another<br />monolith called in the same vein, the Kadalekalu (gram seed) Ganesha.<br />The huge seated God, carved in the round out of a massive boulder, is<br />about 4.5 metres high and is housed in a large shrine with a fine open<br />pillared mantapa in front. The tall, slender and graceful pillars are<br />of the ornate cubical Vijayanagara type with solid early corbels. The<br />mantapa is singularly classical in its architectural proportions and<br />has been admired by many architects and critics. The temple also forms<br />one of the important vintage points from which a good and picturesque<br />view could be had of the Hampi monuments.<br /> <br /> <br />Sasivekalu Ganesha Temple<br />-------------------------<br />On the slope of Hemakuta Hill beyond the Krishna Temple, there are two<br />huge stone images of Ganesha. First one is the Sasivekalu Ganesha<br />about 2.4 metres tall and ironically named as Sasivekalu or mustard<br />seed. The God is seated in a large open mantapa with plain rough<br />square pillars. The right hands hold the ankusa and broken tusk, while<br />the upper left holds a looped pasa or noose. The lower left hand and<br />the trunk are broken. The belly is tied with a snake. This Ganesha is<br />fashioned out of a single boulder in sitting position.<br /><br />King's Balance<br />-----------------<br />To the southwest of Vijayavitthala Temple, one can find the monument<br />popularly known as the King's Balance. It consists of two lofty carved<br />granite pillars about 15 feet high supporting a stone beam about 12<br />feet, provided with three hoops on the underside. One of the pillars<br />has a bas-relief depicting a king and two queens, possibly Krishna<br />Deva Raya and his consorts.<br />Also known as Tula Bhara or Tula Purushadana, the balance was used to<br />weigh the kings of Vijayanagara on certain occasions like solar or<br />lunar eclipse, New years day and coronation day against precious<br />diamonds, gems, gold, silver, etc. and distribute them to the Brahmins.<br /><br /><br /><br />Places of Interest in HOSPET<br />----------------------------<br /><br />TB Dam.<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sivaram Kannan"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Dear Kavitha,<br />    <br />    That was exquisite.

Land of granites and pillars.<br />  <br />  Hotels are there at Hospet which is some 7 kms before hampi. <br />  <br />  Details are :<br />  <br />  The Drive from Bangalore to Hampi<br />  ---------------------------------<br />  The drive from Bangalore to Hampi is a pleasant one. You start off <br />on<br />  NH 4 and continue driving on it till Chitradurga. A right turn just<br />  after Chitradurga gets you onto NH 13 that runs from there to<br />  Sholapur. NH 13 is very sparsely populated with an odd truck or <br />tempo,<br />  the road surfaces though aren&#39;t as good as NH 4 but are pretty <br />okay.<br />  Watch out for farmers spreading their crops across the roads though<br />  From: Hospet to Badami the route gets onto state highways after<br />  Hungund. Driving on these roads needs caution as they are very <br />narrow.<br />  The road surfaces though are exceptionally good. In Badami the <br />streets<br />  are very narrow and a large SUV may have trouble getting through.<br />  <br />  <br />  Places of Interest in Chitradurga &#40;200 Kms &#40;NH4&#41;&#41;<br />  ----------------------------------<br />  <br />  Chitradurga Fort<br />  -----------------<br />  The Historic Fort is a marvel of military architecture that made <br />it<br />  impregnable by the Nayak PaLayagars. It has 19 gateways, 38 <br />posterior<br />  entrances, a palace, a mosque, granaries, oil pits, four secret<br />  entrances and water tanks. Amidst rocky surroundings inside the <br />fort<br />  complex on the hill are many temples. It is on a hilltop with a <br />good<br />  view of the surrounding plains. The place is renowned for its <br />Kallina<br />  Kote &#40;"the place of the stone fort"&#41;, and is home to the "Fort of<br />  Seven Rounds" &#40;??? ??????? ????&#41;, built with large stones. In the <br />hill<br />  fort there are temples of the Sampige Siddeshwara, Hidimbeshwara &#40;a<br />  cave shrine&#41;, Ekanathamma, Phalguneshwara, Gopalakrishan etc., <br />amidst<br />  thick rocky surroundings.<br />  	<br />  Obavvana Kindi &#40;The crack&#41;<br />  ---------------------<br />  During the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the city of Chitradurga was<br />  besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali. A chance sighting of a woman<br />  entering the Chitradurga fort through a crack hole in the rocks <br />led to<br />  a clever plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through the crack<br />  hole. The defense guard on duty of the port near that crack hole <br />had<br />  just gone home as usual asking his wife to guard till he is back <br />from<br />  his lunch. The wife of that guard, Obavva while in her temporary <br />seat,<br />  noticed the soldiers emerging out of this crack, Obavva was not<br />  perturbed. As she was carrying with her, the Onake &#40;a wooden long <br />club<br />  meant for pounding paddy grains&#41; she killed and quietly moved the<br />  dead, so that hundreds of them entered and fell, without raising <br />any<br />  suspicion. The guard, Obavva&#39;s husband, upon his return from his <br />lunch<br />  was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and<br />  hundreds of dead bodies of the enemy fleet around her. The passage<br />  still remains as a historical witness for the story, beside the<br />  Tanniru DoNi -a small water source which holds cold water all round<br />  the year. Though her sincere brave attempt saved the fort this <br />time,<br />  Madakari could not resist the attack of 1799 by Hyder Ali. The <br />fort of<br />  Chitradurga was lost for Hyder Ali once for all.    <br />   <br />  Vaani Vilas Sagara:  <br />  ---------------------<br />  It is also called Mari Kanive is a dam near Hiriyur Taluk,<br />  Chitradurga District, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the<br />  oldest dam in the state.The dam was built by the Mysore Maharajas<br />  pre-independence across the river Vedavathi. The dam is an <br />exquisite<br />  piece of architecture, an engineering marvel for that time, and<br />  provides water to lots of surrounding cities, towns and villages,<br />  which are largely dry lands of the Deccan area of Central <br />Karnataka.<br />  This dam is the source of domestic water for Hiriyur and <br />Chitradurga.<br />  It irrigates more than 100 km? of land in Hiriyur and Challakere<br />  taluks through right and left bank canals. The dam was constructed <br />by<br />  a team led by an Engineer called &#39;Tara Chand Dalal&#39; at the order of<br />  his Highness the Maharaja of Mysore Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV<br />  The dam has been a tourist attraction for many years, but has been<br />  apparently neglected as a prime tourist destination. Recently, <br />though,<br />  the development work undertaken by the forest department to restore<br />  the nearby forest cover, and the &#39;panchavati&#39; gardens - a garden of<br />  medicinal plants with the old Indian cultural theme has improved <br />the<br />  tourist figures, making it a popular weekend picnic spot. The<br />  &#39;panchavati&#39; garden has medicinal plants lined up representing<br />  cultural themes - the &#39;Rashis&#39;, &#39;Sapta swaras&#39;, &#39;Nava grahas&#39; and <br />many<br />  more. The tourists who visit Chitradurga and Hosdurga often visit <br />Mari<br />  kanive on the way. The historic Maarikaamba temple here also <br />attracts<br />  many tourists. The place is around 20 Km drive from Hiriyur on a<br />  deviation from NH4 &#40;Bangalore -Pune National Highway&#41;.<br />   <br />  Murugha Rajendra Bruhanmatha<br />  ------------------------------<br />  The first Murugha Rajendra Mutha at Chitradurga was built on the<br />  Chinmuladri hills by Palegar Bichugatti Bharamanna Nayaka for Guru<br />  Shanthaveera Swamiji of the 8th Pontiff of Murugha tradition. <br />Later it<br />  was shifted to the present mutt in 1703 AD which is situated at the<br />  left side of Chitradurga - Davanagere road near M.K. Hatti. Now the<br />  27th Pontiff of the order Sri Shivamurthy Murugha Rajendra <br />Sharanaru<br />  prerides over the muth. The muth is engaged in propagating<br />  Basavadharma. It runs Schools, Colleges, Hostels, Orphanage , Free<br />  food homes, apart from organizing religious, Social and Cultural<br />  function. It arranges mass marriage, widow remarriages, intercaste<br />  marriages for the benefit of people. The Murugha Vana in the <br />premises<br />  of the mutt is a beautiful botanical garden.<br />   <br />  Chandravalli Gardens<br />  ------------------------------<br />  Chandravalli is an ancient Historical site situated in the <br />western<br />  part of the Chinmuladri hills. A motorable road to the left on<br />  Chitradurga - Holalkere high way leads us to Chandravalli Valley.<br />  Archaelogical discoveries made in the Ankali Mutha are found here. <br />The<br />  sites of Historical excavation, Tiger boulder, Siddeshwara temple,<br />  Ankli Mutha, Panchalingeswara Cave Temple, Dhavalappanagudda and <br />the<br />  Chandravalli Lake are the worth seeing place here.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Places of Interest in HAMPI<br />  ----------------------------------<br />  <br />  AchyutaRaya Temple<br />  -----------------------<br />  This temple can be reached either from Kodanda Rama Temple through<br />  the Bazaar wrongly called "Soolai Bazaar" or "Courtesan Street" or<br />  from the Virupaksha Bazaar by climbing the steps next to the<br />  monolithic Nandi at the end of the bazaar. Achyutaraya Temple is a<br />  large complex built by an officer of the King Achyutaraya, <br />Salakaraju<br />  Tirumaladeva. This temple is better known as Achyutaraya temple, in<br />  whose period it was built rather than the name of the deity<br />  "Tiruvengalanatha" or Lord Venkateshwara.<br />   <br />  Stone Chariot<br />  -----------------------<br />  Though inside the Vijayavittala Temple complex, the Stone Chariot<br />  gets our special attention because it deserves. One will fall <br />short of<br />  words if he/she tries to describe the beauty of this wonderful<br />  man-made piece of art. Situated to the east of the hall, Stone <br />chariot<br />  has stone wheels which some believe actually rotate. We have not<br />  tested it tough. <br />  The chariot is a miniature temple. Though some believe it is <br />carved<br />  out of a single rock, it is not the case. It resembles the temple<br />  chariots or rathas in which the idols of the temple are taken out <br />on a<br />  traditional procession. <br />  <br />  Shri Vijayavitthala Temple<br />  ---------------------------<br />  If one wants to witness the competition between man and <br />Vishwakarma<br />  &#40;the Architect God of Hindus&#41;, this is the place on earth. Any <br />number<br />  of words would fail to do justice to this wonderful monument <br />dedicated<br />  to Lord Vitthala or Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that Lord Vishnu <br />found<br />  it too grand to live in and thus returned to his own humble home. <br />The<br />  Stone Chariot is situated to the east of the temple hall. By far, <br />this<br />  is the most amazing monument in Hampi and is portrayed as the icon <br />for<br />  Hampi.<br />  The construction of this temple started during the reign of King<br />  Krishna Deva Raya in the year 1513 AD. The project was so colossal<br />  that the additions continued for almost five decades until the <br />Empire<br />  fell down in the year 1565 AD.<br />  Built mainly on the original Drividian Temple architecture, this<br />  temple has all the stuff a typical South Indian temple would have.<br />  There is small a main inner sanctum where the deity idol&#40;s&#41; are<br />  placed. Only the chief priest of the temple is permitted inside <br />this<br />  sanctum. The smaller sanctum is followed by a bigger outer shrine<br />  where the general public is allowed. The monumental decoration of <br />the<br />  temple can be seen mainly in this bigger outer house.  <br />  The temple stands, within high walls with 3 gateways on the east,<br />  south and north. The temple stands on a strong stone basement with<br />  richly carved designs of the King&#39;s army and dancing girls. The<br />  dancing halls and kalyanamantapas in the corners are equally worth<br />  noticing.<br />  The carvings on this temple give an insight into the <br />architectural<br />  splendour achieved by the artisans of Vijayanagara Empire. The <br />temple<br />  consists of 56 musical pillars. When tapped gently, these pillars<br />  produce musical sounds. These pillars are popularly known as <br />Musical<br />  Pillars or SaReGaMa pillars after the Saptha Swaras of the Indian<br />  Classical Music.<br />    <br />  Reaching there  <br />  Vitthala temple complex is situated 2 km east of Hampi <br />Bazaar. There<br />  are signs giving directions at frequent intervals which one can <br />follow<br />  to reach there.<br />    <br />  <br />  Hazari Rama Temple<br />  -----------------------<br />  This temple for Lord Rama is popularly called "Hazari Rama Temple" <br />or<br />  "Hazara Rama Temple" because of the large number of Ramayana <br />panels on<br />  the walls. This temple is believed to have been the private place <br />of<br />  worship of the Royal family.<br />  Originally, the temple consisted of a sanctum, an ardha mantapa <br />and a<br />  pillared hall to which an open porch with tall and elegant pillars <br />was<br />  added subsequently. A high wall encloses the entire complex with <br />the<br />  main entrances set on the east. To the south is a small doorway, <br />which<br />  leads to the Durbar Area. The pillar hall is notable for its unique<br />  pillars in black-stone. They are set on a raised stone platform in <br />the<br />  middle of the hall. The tall and elegant pillars of the open porch <br />are<br />  also worth a second look. The other structures in this temple <br />complex<br />  are a shrine for Devi and Utsava Mantapa.<br />  As the name indicates, this temple is famous for its many Ramayana<br />  panels. This is the only temple in Hampi where the exterior walls <br />have<br />  boldly chiselled bas-reliefs. These bas-reliefs are narrative in<br />  nature. The Ramayana epic is carved in detail. Incidents in the <br />story<br />  like Dasaratha performing a sacrifice to beget sons, the birth of<br />  Rama, his exile into the forest, the abduction of Sita and the<br />  ultimate fight between Rama and Ravana are all carved in a vivid<br />  manner. In these panels, the story of Rama and through it the <br />triumph<br />  of good over evil is brought out. The genesis of Hampi dates back <br />to<br />  the age Ramayana when it was the monkey kingdom Kishkindha.<br />  This temple now unused is situated in the royal enclosure of the <br />city<br />  and was probably the king&#39;s private shrine. The enclosure walls of <br />the<br />  temple are exceptional in a way that they are both carved on the<br />  outside as well as inside. The outer friezes depict horses, <br />elephants,<br />  dancing girls and infantry in procession; the inner panels show <br />scenes<br />  from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The enclosure wall also has <br />panels<br />  on the exterior side. The boldly carved panels are in five <br />horizontal<br />  rows, one above the other, representing a procession of elephants <br />with<br />  riders and attendants, prancing horses with riders and rider less<br />  horses led by grooms, wrestlers and soldiers in procession <br />witnessed<br />  by a few seated royal figures. These panels represent symbolically <br />the<br />  power of the rulers and the might of their fighting forces paraded<br />  annually at the time of the Dusshera festival.<br />  On the wall of the god&#39;s sanctum are two rare depictions of Vishnu <br />as<br />  the Buddha. Though the temple is small it is a fine example of the<br />  skill of Vijayanagara&#39;s sculptors. Only master craftsmen can coax<br />  filigree and lace out of Deccan stone. <br />  <br />  Shri Virupaksha Temple<br />  -----------------------<br />  The Virupaksha temple is located at the foot of the hill called<br />  Hemakuta Hill is the core of the village of Hampi. The temple, <br />often<br />  called Pampapathi temple, is the most sacred of the temples of this<br />  place. Historically speaking, this temple has an uninterrupted <br />history<br />  from about the 7th century. The temple contains the shirines of <br />Lord<br />  Shiva, Pampa and Bhuvaneshwari. What was once a small shrine, in<br />  course of time, developed into a large complex under the <br />Vijayanagara<br />  rulers. At present, the main temple consists of a Sanctum, three <br />ante<br />  chambers, a pillared hall and a Mukha Mantapa also called Ranga<br />  Mantapa or an open pillared hall. A pillared cloister, entrance<br />  gateways, courtyards, attendant shrines and other manttapas <br />surround<br />  the temple. In 1510 A.D. Krishnadevaraya added the above-mentioned<br />  Ranga Mantapa.<br />  The Ranga mantapa consists of 38 pillars, relieved with <br />sculptures.<br />  These pillars are divided into two vertical sections - the first is<br />  cut to resemble a rearing Yali - a mythical lion, standing on a<br />  Makara, while the second section is basically square with small<br />  relief, depicting mostly Shaiva themes. These pillars are<br />  aesthetically composed and skilfully constructed.<br />  The central ceiling of the Ranga Mantapa is of substantial size. <br />The<br />  ceiling as well as the beams supporting the ceilings is covered <br />with<br />  painted panels. The panel depicts themes from the Mahabharatha, the<br />  Ramayana and the Shiva Puranas as well as from the contemporary <br />life.<br />  Starting at the entrance of the temple is Virupaksha Bazaar or<br />  market, largest of the many bazaars of Vijayanagara. Each major <br />Temple<br />  complex had its own bazaar around which a township developed. This <br />is<br />  the only bazaar around which a township of a sort still exists. <br />This<br />  bazaar is flanked by the main gopura of Virupaksha temple called<br />  Bishtappa&#39;s gopura on the one end and the monolithic Nandi at the<br />  other end. The 9 storied, 53 meters high gopura adds elegance to <br />the<br />  732 meters long and 28 meters wide Virupaksha Bazaar. <br />  The other temple of significance in this complex is the shrine for<br />  Goddess Bhuvaneshwari. This shrine was rebuilt in the Vijayanagara<br />  days, over an 11th century temple. This temple is chiefly noted for<br />  its marvelously worked door-frame, pillars and articulately <br />chiseled<br />  ceiling panels.<br />   <br />  Ugra Narasimha<br />  -----------------------<br />  This image of Lakshmi-Narasimha, popularly called Ugranarasimha,<br />  meaning Narasimha of terrifying countenance, is hewn out of a rock<br />  in-situ. According to an inscription found here, it was executed in<br />  1528 A.D. during the rule of Krishnadevaraya. Originally, the icon<br />  bore a smaller image of Lakshmi sitting on his lap. This gigantic<br />  image, 6.7 meters in height, was mutilated and the figure of <br />Lakshmi<br />  was entirely damaged and vandalized in 1565 A.D. Narasimha with an<br />  articulately chiseled and well delineated mane and large bulging <br />eyes<br />  and broad chest still retains His awesome charm. He is seated on <br />the<br />  coils of the snake Adisesha, who rises behind him with seven hoods,<br />  which serve as a canopy. The entire image is set within a Makara<br />  torana, or arch, with a lion-mask above the hoods of Adisesha.<br />  The statue of Lakshmi can now be found at Kamalapura Museum.<br />  As mentioned above, the whole statue of Narasimha and Lakshmi was <br />cut<br />  in a single boulder. While other kingdoms further southwards used<br />  Schist, a soft stone as the medium of their constructions, the<br />  Sangamas decided to go in for granite as the building material for<br />  their temples. The hard granite was available on the site in plenty<br />  and was economic. Granite, being hard, was not suitable for the<br />  delicate filigree work that could be carved on Schist. What the<br />  artists had to sacrifice on the delicacy of the work was <br />compensated<br />  by the massiveness of the sculptures. The statue of Ugra Narasimha <br />is<br />  a perfect example of what they achieved in volume which they could <br />not<br />  in delicacy.<br />   <br />  Water Channels<br />  -----------------------<br />  The Palace area is dotted with innumerable water tanks of various<br />  sizes. In fact, the whole of Hampi ruins has very many water tanks.<br />  All these tanks were supplied with water by a well-planned water<br />  supply system.<br />  Water from the Kamalapura tank feeds the main stone aqueduct <br />running<br />  east to West in the royal enclosure. First it feeds the large <br />public<br />  tank and then the stepped tank. Later the main stone aqueduct <br />branches<br />  off to North and West, which in turn feed nineteen other small and <br />big<br />  tanks all over the royal enclosure. At the point of branching off <br />of<br />  the main stone aqueduct, a well was dug to enable water supply in <br />case<br />  the water supply from Kamalapura tank ceased. The drain and waste<br />  water from the royal enclosure was taken out through underground <br />stone<br />  slab-lime concrete drainage channels either directly or through a <br />huge<br />  drain found on the southern side adjoining the walled garden.<br />  The major irrigation works of the Vijayanagara rulers include Raya<br />  Canal, Basavanna Canal, Turthu Canal and the huge tank at <br />Kamalapura.<br />  These irrigation works are still in use.<br />   <br />  Elephant Stable<br />  -----------------------<br />  Located outside the Zenana Enclosure, on the East, is an oblong<br />  structure of considerable size, called the Elephant stables. Among <br />the<br />  many civil structures of the place, this building is a fine <br />example of<br />  Indo-Islamic style of architecture.<br />  It has a greater Islamic character about it. The building <br />consists of<br />  eleven large rooms with very high ceilings. Large domes crown ten <br />of<br />  these. These domes are of brick and mortar, and are of different<br />  shapes drum-shaped, ribbed and octagonal. The superstructure of the<br />  central upper pavilion is lost. It probably had a Hindu Shikhara in<br />  consonance with the Indo-Islamic architecture.<br />  The rooms were used as Elephant stables. The elephants were tied <br />to<br />  the chairs hanging from the centre of the ceiling as can be made <br />out<br />  from the iron hooks embedded in some of the ceilings. These were <br />not<br />  the military elephants but were the ceremonial ones which were <br />used by<br />  royal household. Apart from the royal elephants, temples also had<br />  elephants of their own to perform various pujas. One such elephant <br />can<br />  still be seen in Hampi.<br />  <br />  Prasanna Virupaksha Temple<br />  --------------------------<br />  More popularly known as Underground Virupaksha Temple, this is<br />  situated to the west of the Danaik&#39;s Enclosure. A large broken <br />loose<br />  slab containing an inscription which records a grant to the temple <br />of<br />  Prasanna Virupaksha by King Krishna Deva Raya on the occasion of <br />his<br />  coronation.<br />  The temple faces east and is much below the present ground level. <br />The<br />  temple is much dilapidated. The large and wide two-tiered gupura on<br />  the east has no superstructure extant. The main sanctum has many <br />axial<br />  mantapas. The easternmost of these is a pillared seven-aisled<br />  maha-mantapa with a tall and tapering dipa or dhwaja stambha<br />  protruding through its roof top. To the north and south of the <br />mantapa<br />  are the remnants of corridor with pillars of the heavy early <br />cubical<br />  type as in Ganagitti Temple.<br />  The floor of the maha mantapa, the other axial mantapas as well as<br />  the main sanctum are under water. The maha-mantapa leads to the<br />  three-aisled ardha-mantapa, the large cubical pillars of which are<br />  also of an early type, with cubical base, octagonal shafts, a thin<br />  pionted kumbha and large idol. The kalyana-mantapa at the south-<br />west<br />  corner of the temple is an ornate one in the typical Vijayanagara <br />style.<br />   <br />  Balakrishna Temple<br />  --------------------<br />  Krishnadevaraya built this temple in 1513 A.D. to commemorate his<br />  victory over Prataparudra Gajapati, the ruler of Orissa. During the<br />  battle he seized an image of child Krishna and brought it to<br />  Vijayanagara as war trophy. He then built this temple to consecrate<br />  the image. An inscription describing the conquest and the <br />consecration<br />  of this temple on 16 February 1515 by Krishnadevaraya is found on a<br />  slab in front of this temple. Built in the centre of a courtyard, <br />the<br />  temple possesses a sanctum, an antechamber, an ardha mantapa, a<br />  circumambulatory passage, a pillared hall with three entrances and <br />an<br />  open pillared mantapa, in addition to a number of other shrines for<br />  the attendant deities. The sanctum is at present empty. The image <br />of<br />  Balakrishna showing him as a child holding butter in the right <br />hand is<br />  now resting in the Government Museum at Madras.<br />  The inner sides of the entrance exhibit beautifully sculptured <br />Apsaras<br />  standing on mythical animals and holding scrolls filled with panels<br />  showing the ten incarnations of the lord. Like all major temple<br />  complexes, Krishnapura, a suburb, is developed around this temple. <br />The<br />  bazaar in front is now a lush paddy field.<br />  <br />  Stepped Tank<br />  --------------------<br />  One of the beautiful remains in the Durbar area is tile Stepped <br />Tank<br />  built in chlorite schist, used by the royals and for religious<br />  purposes. The small but neat tank is about 22 square meters and <br />about<br />  7 meters deep. It has five distinct tiers, each fitted with steps <br />set<br />  in a pleasing pattern. The mason marks on the individual blocks<br />  indicating the direction, the row and the location of the steps <br />reveal<br />  that the layout of this stepped tank was well thought out in <br />advance<br />  and all the different block stones were prepared in accordance with<br />  the plan elsewhere and assembled on the site later. This tank was<br />  discovered during the recent excavations.<br />  A bigger tank measuring roughly 73 meters by 27 meters is at the<br />  entrance into the Durbar area, and located to the Northwest of the<br />  Queen&#39;s bath. The common people probably used this tank.<br />  <br />  Kadalekalu Ganesha Temple<br />  -------------------------<br />  On the slope of Hemakuta Hill, near the Sasivekalu Ganesha is <br />another<br />  monolith called in the same vein, the Kadalekalu &#40;gram seed&#41; <br />Ganesha.<br />  The huge seated God, carved in the round out of a massive boulder, <br />is<br />  about 4.5 metres high and is housed in a large shrine with a fine <br />open<br />  pillared mantapa in front. The tall, slender and graceful pillars <br />are<br />  of the ornate cubical Vijayanagara type with solid early corbels. <br />The<br />  mantapa is singularly classical in its architectural proportions <br />and<br />  has been admired by many architects and critics. The temple also <br />forms<br />  one of the important vintage points from which a good and <br />picturesque<br />  view could be had of the Hampi monuments.<br />   <br />   <br />  Sasivekalu Ganesha Temple<br />  -------------------------<br />  On the slope of Hemakuta Hill beyond the Krishna Temple, there are <br />two<br />  huge stone images of Ganesha. First one is the Sasivekalu Ganesha<br />  about 2.4 metres tall and ironically named as Sasivekalu or mustard<br />  seed. The God is seated in a large open mantapa with plain rough<br />  square pillars. The right hands hold the ankusa and broken tusk, <br />while<br />  the upper left holds a looped pasa or noose. The lower left hand <br />and<br />  the trunk are broken. The belly is tied with a snake. This Ganesha <br />is<br />  fashioned out of a single boulder in sitting position.<br />  <br />  King&#39;s Balance<br />  -----------------<br />  To the southwest of Vijayavitthala Temple, one can find the <br />monument<br />  popularly known as the King&#39;s Balance. It consists of two lofty <br />carved<br />  granite pillars about 15 feet high supporting a stone beam about 12<br />  feet, provided with three hoops on the underside. One of the <br />pillars<br />  has a bas-relief depicting a king and two queens, possibly Krishna<br />  Deva Raya and his consorts.<br />  Also known as Tula Bhara or Tula Purushadana, the balance was <br />used to<br />  weigh the kings of Vijayanagara on certain occasions like solar or<br />  lunar eclipse, New years day and coronation day against precious<br />  diamonds, gems, gold, silver, etc. and distribute them to the <br />Brahmins.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Places of Interest in HOSPET<br />  ----------------------------<br />  <br />  TB Dam.<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sivaram Kannan"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      Dear Kavitha,<br />      <br />      That was exquisite.

Land of granites and pillars.<br /><br />Hotels are there at Hospet which is some 7 kms before hampi.<br /><br />Details are :<br /><br />The Drive from Bangalore to Hampi<br />---------------------------------<br />The drive from Bangalore to Hampi is a pleasant one. You start off on<br />NH 4 and continue driving on it till Chitradurga. A right turn just<br />after Chitradurga gets you onto NH 13 that runs from there to<br />Sholapur. NH 13 is very sparsely populated with an odd truck or tempo,<br />the road surfaces though aren't as good as NH 4 but are pretty okay.<br />Watch out for farmers spreading their crops across the roads though<br />From: Hospet to Badami the route gets onto state highways after<br />Hungund. Driving on these roads needs caution as they are very narrow.<br />The road surfaces though are exceptionally good. In Badami the streets<br />are very narrow and a large SUV may have trouble getting through.<br /><br />Places of Interest in Chitradurga (200 Kms (NH4))<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />Chitradurga Fort<br />-----------------<br />The Historic Fort is a marvel of military architecture that made it<br />impregnable by the Nayak PaLayagars. It has 19 gateways, 38 posterior<br />entrances, a palace, a mosque, granaries, oil pits, four secret<br />entrances and water tanks. Amidst rocky surroundings inside the fort<br />complex on the hill are many temples. It is on a hilltop with a good<br />view of the surrounding plains. The place is renowned for its Kallina<br />Kote ("the place of the stone fort"), and is home to the "Fort of<br />Seven Rounds" (??? ??????? ????), built with large stones. In the hill<br />fort there are temples of the Sampige Siddeshwara, Hidimbeshwara (a<br />cave shrine), Ekanathamma, Phalguneshwara, Gopalakrishan etc., amidst<br />thick rocky surroundings.<br /><br />Obavvana Kindi (The crack)<br />---------------------<br />During the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the city of Chitradurga was<br />besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali. A chance sighting of a woman<br />entering the Chitradurga fort through a crack hole in the rocks led to<br />a clever plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through the crack<br />hole. The defense guard on duty of the port near that crack hole had<br />just gone home as usual asking his wife to guard till he is back from<br />his lunch. The wife of that guard, Obavva while in her temporary seat,<br />noticed the soldiers emerging out of this crack, Obavva was not<br />perturbed. As she was carrying with her, the Onake (a wooden long club<br />meant for pounding paddy grains) she killed and quietly moved the<br />dead, so that hundreds of them entered and fell, without raising any<br />suspicion. The guard, Obavva's husband, upon his return from his lunch<br />was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and<br />hundreds of dead bodies of the enemy fleet around her. The passage<br />still remains as a historical witness for the story, beside the<br />Tanniru DoNi -a small water source which holds cold water all round<br />the year. Though her sincere brave attempt saved the fort this time,<br />Madakari could not resist the attack of 1799 by Hyder Ali. The fort of<br />Chitradurga was lost for Hyder Ali once for all.<br /><br />Vaani Vilas Sagara:<br />---------------------<br />It is also called Mari Kanive is a dam near Hiriyur Taluk,<br />Chitradurga District, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the<br />oldest dam in the state.The dam was built by the Mysore Maharajas<br />pre-independence across the river Vedavathi. The dam is an exquisite<br />piece of architecture, an engineering marvel for that time, and<br />provides water to lots of surrounding cities, towns and villages,<br />which are largely dry lands of the Deccan area of Central Karnataka.<br />This dam is the source of domestic water for Hiriyur and Chitradurga.<br />It irrigates more than 100 km? of land in Hiriyur and Challakere<br />taluks through right and left bank canals. The dam was constructed by<br />a team led by an Engineer called 'Tara Chand Dalal' at the order of<br />his Highness the Maharaja of Mysore Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV<br />The dam has been a tourist attraction for many years, but has been<br />apparently neglected as a prime tourist destination. Recently, though,<br />the development work undertaken by the forest department to restore<br />the nearby forest cover, and the 'panchavati' gardens - a garden of<br />medicinal plants with the old Indian cultural theme has improved the<br />tourist figures, making it a popular weekend picnic spot. The<br />'panchavati' garden has medicinal plants lined up representing<br />cultural themes - the 'Rashis', 'Sapta swaras', 'Nava grahas' and many<br />more. The tourists who visit Chitradurga and Hosdurga often visit Mari<br />kanive on the way. The historic Maarikaamba temple here also attracts<br />many tourists. The place is around 20 Km drive from Hiriyur on a<br />deviation from NH4 (Bangalore -Pune National Highway).<br /><br />Murugha Rajendra Bruhanmatha<br />------------------------------<br />The first Murugha Rajendra Mutha at Chitradurga was built on the<br />Chinmuladri hills by Palegar Bichugatti Bharamanna Nayaka for Guru<br />Shanthaveera Swamiji of the 8th Pontiff of Murugha tradition. Later it<br />was shifted to the present mutt in 1703 AD which is situated at the<br />left side of Chitradurga - Davanagere road near M.K. Hatti. Now the<br />27th Pontiff of the order Sri Shivamurthy Murugha Rajendra Sharanaru<br />prerides over the muth. The muth is engaged in propagating<br />Basavadharma. It runs Schools, Colleges, Hostels, Orphanage , Free<br />food homes, apart from organizing religious, Social and Cultural<br />function. It arranges mass marriage, widow remarriages, intercaste<br />marriages for the benefit of people. The Murugha Vana in the premises<br />of the mutt is a beautiful botanical garden.<br /><br />Chandravalli Gardens<br />------------------------------<br />Chandravalli is an ancient Historical site situated in the western<br />part of the Chinmuladri hills. A motorable road to the left on<br />Chitradurga - Holalkere high way leads us to Chandravalli Valley.<br />Archaelogical discoveries made in the Ankali Mutha are found here. The<br />sites of Historical excavation, Tiger boulder, Siddeshwara temple,<br />Ankli Mutha, Panchalingeswara Cave Temple, Dhavalappanagudda and the<br />Chandravalli Lake are the worth seeing place here.<br /><br />Places of Interest in HAMPI<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />AchyutaRaya Temple<br />-----------------------<br />This temple can be reached either from Kodanda Rama Temple through<br />the Bazaar wrongly called "Soolai Bazaar" or "Courtesan Street" or<br />from the Virupaksha Bazaar by climbing the steps next to the<br />monolithic Nandi at the end of the bazaar. Achyutaraya Temple is a<br />large complex built by an officer of the King Achyutaraya, Salakaraju<br />Tirumaladeva. This temple is better known as Achyutaraya temple, in<br />whose period it was built rather than the name of the deity<br />"Tiruvengalanatha" or Lord Venkateshwara.<br /><br />Stone Chariot<br />-----------------------<br />Though inside the Vijayavittala Temple complex, the Stone Chariot<br />gets our special attention because it deserves. One will fall short of<br />words if he/she tries to describe the beauty of this wonderful<br />man-made piece of art. Situated to the east of the hall, Stone chariot<br />has stone wheels which some believe actually rotate. We have not<br />tested it tough.<br />The chariot is a miniature temple. Though some believe it is carved<br />out of a single rock, it is not the case. It resembles the temple<br />chariots or rathas in which the idols of the temple are taken out on a<br />traditional procession.<br /><br />Shri Vijayavitthala Temple<br />---------------------------<br />If one wants to witness the competition between man and Vishwakarma<br />(the Architect God of Hindus), this is the place on earth. Any number<br />of words would fail to do justice to this wonderful monument dedicated<br />to Lord Vitthala or Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that Lord Vishnu found<br />it too grand to live in and thus returned to his own humble home. The<br />Stone Chariot is situated to the east of the temple hall. By far, this<br />is the most amazing monument in Hampi and is portrayed as the icon for<br />Hampi.<br />The construction of this temple started during the reign of King<br />Krishna Deva Raya in the year 1513 AD. The project was so colossal<br />that the additions continued for almost five decades until the Empire<br />fell down in the year 1565 AD.<br />Built mainly on the original Drividian Temple architecture, this<br />temple has all the stuff a typical South Indian temple would have.<br />There is small a main inner sanctum where the deity idol(s) are<br />placed. Only the chief priest of the temple is permitted inside this<br />sanctum. The smaller sanctum is followed by a bigger outer shrine<br />where the general public is allowed. The monumental decoration of the<br />temple can be seen mainly in this bigger outer house.<br />The temple stands, within high walls with 3 gateways on the east,<br />south and north. The temple stands on a strong stone basement with<br />richly carved designs of the King's army and dancing girls. The<br />dancing halls and kalyanamantapas in the corners are equally worth<br />noticing.<br />The carvings on this temple give an insight into the architectural<br />splendour achieved by the artisans of Vijayanagara Empire. The temple<br />consists of 56 musical pillars. When tapped gently, these pillars<br />produce musical sounds. These pillars are popularly known as Musical<br />Pillars or SaReGaMa pillars after the Saptha Swaras of the Indian<br />Classical Music.<br /><br />Reaching there<br />Vitthala temple complex is situated 2 km east of Hampi Bazaar. There<br />are signs giving directions at frequent intervals which one can follow<br />to reach there.<br /><br /><br />Hazari Rama Temple<br />-----------------------<br />This temple for Lord Rama is popularly called "Hazari Rama Temple" or<br />"Hazara Rama Temple" because of the large number of Ramayana panels on<br />the walls. This temple is believed to have been the private place of<br />worship of the Royal family.<br />Originally, the temple consisted of a sanctum, an ardha mantapa and a<br />pillared hall to which an open porch with tall and elegant pillars was<br />added subsequently. A high wall encloses the entire complex with the<br />main entrances set on the east. To the south is a small doorway, which<br />leads to the Durbar Area. The pillar hall is notable for its unique<br />pillars in black-stone. They are set on a raised stone platform in the<br />middle of the hall. The tall and elegant pillars of the open porch are<br />also worth a second look. The other structures in this temple complex<br />are a shrine for Devi and Utsava Mantapa.<br />As the name indicates, this temple is famous for its many Ramayana<br />panels. This is the only temple in Hampi where the exterior walls have<br />boldly chiselled bas-reliefs. These bas-reliefs are narrative in<br />nature. The Ramayana epic is carved in detail. Incidents in the story<br />like Dasaratha performing a sacrifice to beget sons, the birth of<br />Rama, his exile into the forest, the abduction of Sita and the<br />ultimate fight between Rama and Ravana are all carved in a vivid<br />manner. In these panels, the story of Rama and through it the triumph<br />of good over evil is brought out. The genesis of Hampi dates back to<br />the age Ramayana when it was the monkey kingdom Kishkindha.<br />This temple now unused is situated in the royal enclosure of the city<br />and was probably the king's private shrine. The enclosure walls of the<br />temple are exceptional in a way that they are both carved on the<br />outside as well as inside. The outer friezes depict horses, elephants,<br />dancing girls and infantry in procession; the inner panels show scenes<br />from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The enclosure wall also has panels<br />on the exterior side. The boldly carved panels are in five horizontal<br />rows, one above the other, representing a procession of elephants with<br />riders and attendants, prancing horses with riders and rider less<br />horses led by grooms, wrestlers and soldiers in procession witnessed<br />by a few seated royal figures. These panels represent symbolically the<br />power of the rulers and the might of their fighting forces paraded<br />annually at the time of the Dusshera festival.<br />On the wall of the god's sanctum are two rare depictions of Vishnu as<br />the Buddha. Though the temple is small it is a fine example of the<br />skill of Vijayanagara's sculptors. Only master craftsmen can coax<br />filigree and lace out of Deccan stone.<br /><br />Shri Virupaksha Temple<br />-----------------------<br />The Virupaksha temple is located at the foot of the hill called<br />Hemakuta Hill is the core of the village of Hampi. The temple, often<br />called Pampapathi temple, is the most sacred of the temples of this<br />place. Historically speaking, this temple has an uninterrupted history<br />from about the 7th century. The temple contains the shirines of Lord<br />Shiva, Pampa and Bhuvaneshwari. What was once a small shrine, in<br />course of time, developed into a large complex under the Vijayanagara<br />rulers. At present, the main temple consists of a Sanctum, three ante<br />chambers, a pillared hall and a Mukha Mantapa also called Ranga<br />Mantapa or an open pillared hall. A pillared cloister, entrance<br />gateways, courtyards, attendant shrines and other manttapas surround<br />the temple. In 1510 A.D. Krishnadevaraya added the above-mentioned<br />Ranga Mantapa.<br />The Ranga mantapa consists of 38 pillars, relieved with sculptures.<br />These pillars are divided into two vertical sections - the first is<br />cut to resemble a rearing Yali - a mythical lion, standing on a<br />Makara, while the second section is basically square with small<br />relief, depicting mostly Shaiva themes. These pillars are<br />aesthetically composed and skilfully constructed.<br />The central ceiling of the Ranga Mantapa is of substantial size. The<br />ceiling as well as the beams supporting the ceilings is covered with<br />painted panels. The panel depicts themes from the Mahabharatha, the<br />Ramayana and the Shiva Puranas as well as from the contemporary life.<br />Starting at the entrance of the temple is Virupaksha Bazaar or<br />market, largest of the many bazaars of Vijayanagara. Each major Temple<br />complex had its own bazaar around which a township developed. This is<br />the only bazaar around which a township of a sort still exists. This<br />bazaar is flanked by the main gopura of Virupaksha temple called<br />Bishtappa's gopura on the one end and the monolithic Nandi at the<br />other end. The 9 storied, 53 meters high gopura adds elegance to the<br />732 meters long and 28 meters wide Virupaksha Bazaar.<br />The other temple of significance in this complex is the shrine for<br />Goddess Bhuvaneshwari. This shrine was rebuilt in the Vijayanagara<br />days, over an 11th century temple. This temple is chiefly noted for<br />its marvelously worked door-frame, pillars and articulately chiseled<br />ceiling panels.<br /><br />Ugra Narasimha<br />-----------------------<br />This image of Lakshmi-Narasimha, popularly called Ugranarasimha,<br />meaning Narasimha of terrifying countenance, is hewn out of a rock<br />in-situ. According to an inscription found here, it was executed in<br />1528 A.D. during the rule of Krishnadevaraya. Originally, the icon<br />bore a smaller image of Lakshmi sitting on his lap. This gigantic<br />image, 6.7 meters in height, was mutilated and the figure of Lakshmi<br />was entirely damaged and vandalized in 1565 A.D. Narasimha with an<br />articulately chiseled and well delineated mane and large bulging eyes<br />and broad chest still retains His awesome charm. He is seated on the<br />coils of the snake Adisesha, who rises behind him with seven hoods,<br />which serve as a canopy. The entire image is set within a Makara<br />torana, or arch, with a lion-mask above the hoods of Adisesha.<br />The statue of Lakshmi can now be found at Kamalapura Museum.<br />As mentioned above, the whole statue of Narasimha and Lakshmi was cut<br />in a single boulder. While other kingdoms further southwards used<br />Schist, a soft stone as the medium of their constructions, the<br />Sangamas decided to go in for granite as the building material for<br />their temples. The hard granite was available on the site in plenty<br />and was economic. Granite, being hard, was not suitable for the<br />delicate filigree work that could be carved on Schist. What the<br />artists had to sacrifice on the delicacy of the work was compensated<br />by the massiveness of the sculptures. The statue of Ugra Narasimha is<br />a perfect example of what they achieved in volume which they could not<br />in delicacy.<br /><br />Water Channels<br />-----------------------<br />The Palace area is dotted with innumerable water tanks of various<br />sizes. In fact, the whole of Hampi ruins has very many water tanks.<br />All these tanks were supplied with water by a well-planned water<br />supply system.<br />Water from the Kamalapura tank feeds the main stone aqueduct running<br />east to West in the royal enclosure. First it feeds the large public<br />tank and then the stepped tank. Later the main stone aqueduct branches<br />off to North and West, which in turn feed nineteen other small and big<br />tanks all over the royal enclosure. At the point of branching off of<br />the main stone aqueduct, a well was dug to enable water supply in case<br />the water supply from Kamalapura tank ceased. The drain and waste<br />water from the royal enclosure was taken out through underground stone<br />slab-lime concrete drainage channels either directly or through a huge<br />drain found on the southern side adjoining the walled garden.<br />The major irrigation works of the Vijayanagara rulers include Raya<br />Canal, Basavanna Canal, Turthu Canal and the huge tank at Kamalapura.<br />These irrigation works are still in use.<br /><br />Elephant Stable<br />-----------------------<br />Located outside the Zenana Enclosure, on the East, is an oblong<br />structure of considerable size, called the Elephant stables. Among the<br />many civil structures of the place, this building is a fine example of<br />Indo-Islamic style of architecture.<br />It has a greater Islamic character about it. The building consists of<br />eleven large rooms with very high ceilings. Large domes crown ten of<br />these. These domes are of brick and mortar, and are of different<br />shapes drum-shaped, ribbed and octagonal. The superstructure of the<br />central upper pavilion is lost. It probably had a Hindu Shikhara in<br />consonance with the Indo-Islamic architecture.<br />The rooms were used as Elephant stables. The elephants were tied to<br />the chairs hanging from the centre of the ceiling as can be made out<br />from the iron hooks embedded in some of the ceilings. These were not<br />the military elephants but were the ceremonial ones which were used by<br />royal household. Apart from the royal elephants, temples also had<br />elephants of their own to perform various pujas. One such elephant can<br />still be seen in Hampi.<br /><br />Prasanna Virupaksha Temple<br />--------------------------<br />More popularly known as Underground Virupaksha Temple, this is<br />situated to the west of the Danaik's Enclosure. A large broken loose<br />slab containing an inscription which records a grant to the temple of<br />Prasanna Virupaksha by King Krishna Deva Raya on the occasion of his<br />coronation.<br />The temple faces east and is much below the present ground level. The<br />temple is much dilapidated. The large and wide two-tiered gupura on<br />the east has no superstructure extant. The main sanctum has many axial<br />mantapas. The easternmost of these is a pillared seven-aisled<br />maha-mantapa with a tall and tapering dipa or dhwaja stambha<br />protruding through its roof top. To the north and south of the mantapa<br />are the remnants of corridor with pillars of the heavy early cubical<br />type as in Ganagitti Temple.<br />The floor of the maha mantapa, the other axial mantapas as well as<br />the main sanctum are under water. The maha-mantapa leads to the<br />three-aisled ardha-mantapa, the large cubical pillars of which are<br />also of an early type, with cubical base, octagonal shafts, a thin<br />pionted kumbha and large idol. The kalyana-mantapa at the south-west<br />corner of the temple is an ornate one in the typical Vijayanagara style.<br /><br />Balakrishna Temple<br />--------------------<br />Krishnadevaraya built this temple in 1513 A.D. to commemorate his<br />victory over Prataparudra Gajapati, the ruler of Orissa. During the<br />battle he seized an image of child Krishna and brought it to<br />Vijayanagara as war trophy. He then built this temple to consecrate<br />the image. An inscription describing the conquest and the consecration<br />of this temple on 16 February 1515 by Krishnadevaraya is found on a<br />slab in front of this temple. Built in the centre of a courtyard, the<br />temple possesses a sanctum, an antechamber, an ardha mantapa, a<br />circumambulatory passage, a pillared hall with three entrances and an<br />open pillared mantapa, in addition to a number of other shrines for<br />the attendant deities. The sanctum is at present empty. The image of<br />Balakrishna showing him as a child holding butter in the right hand is<br />now resting in the Government Museum at Madras.<br />The inner sides of the entrance exhibit beautifully sculptured Apsaras<br />standing on mythical animals and holding scrolls filled with panels<br />showing the ten incarnations of the lord. Like all major temple<br />complexes, Krishnapura, a suburb, is developed around this temple. The<br />bazaar in front is now a lush paddy field.<br /><br />Stepped Tank<br />--------------------<br />One of the beautiful remains in the Durbar area is tile Stepped Tank<br />built in chlorite schist, used by the royals and for religious<br />purposes. The small but neat tank is about 22 square meters and about<br />7 meters deep. It has five distinct tiers, each fitted with steps set<br />in a pleasing pattern. The mason marks on the individual blocks<br />indicating the direction, the row and the location of the steps reveal<br />that the layout of this stepped tank was well thought out in advance<br />and all the different block stones were prepared in accordance with<br />the plan elsewhere and assembled on the site later. This tank was<br />discovered during the recent excavations.<br />A bigger tank measuring roughly 73 meters by 27 meters is at the<br />entrance into the Durbar area, and located to the Northwest of the<br />Queen's bath. The common people probably used this tank.<br /><br />Kadalekalu Ganesha Temple<br />-------------------------<br />On the slope of Hemakuta Hill, near the Sasivekalu Ganesha is another<br />monolith called in the same vein, the Kadalekalu (gram seed) Ganesha.<br />The huge seated God, carved in the round out of a massive boulder, is<br />about 4.5 metres high and is housed in a large shrine with a fine open<br />pillared mantapa in front. The tall, slender and graceful pillars are<br />of the ornate cubical Vijayanagara type with solid early corbels. The<br />mantapa is singularly classical in its architectural proportions and<br />has been admired by many architects and critics. The temple also forms<br />one of the important vintage points from which a good and picturesque<br />view could be had of the Hampi monuments.<br /><br /><br />Sasivekalu Ganesha Temple<br />-------------------------<br />On the slope of Hemakuta Hill beyond the Krishna Temple, there are two<br />huge stone images of Ganesha. First one is the Sasivekalu Ganesha<br />about 2.4 metres tall and ironically named as Sasivekalu or mustard<br />seed. The God is seated in a large open mantapa with plain rough<br />square pillars. The right hands hold the ankusa and broken tusk, while<br />the upper left holds a looped pasa or noose. The lower left hand and<br />the trunk are broken. The belly is tied with a snake. This Ganesha is<br />fashioned out of a single boulder in sitting position.<br /><br />King's Balance<br />-----------------<br />To the southwest of Vijayavitthala Temple, one can find the monument<br />popularly known as the King's Balance. It consists of two lofty carved<br />granite pillars about 15 feet high supporting a stone beam about 12<br />feet, provided with three hoops on the underside. One of the pillars<br />has a bas-relief depicting a king and two queens, possibly Krishna<br />Deva Raya and his consorts.<br />Also known as Tula Bhara or Tula Purushadana, the balance was used to<br />weigh the kings of Vijayanagara on certain occasions like solar or<br />lunar eclipse, New years day and coronation day against precious<br />diamonds, gems, gold, silver, etc. and distribute them to the Brahmins.<br /><br />Places of Interest in HOSPET<br />----------------------------<br /><br />TB Dam.<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sivaram Kannan"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Dear Kavitha,<br />   <br />    That was exquisite.
