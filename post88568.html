			<div class="content">Dear Mr Venkatesh;<br /><br />I am writing this mail because the subject of Maduranayagam came up in our<br />below mail. Did you mean Marudhanayagam?

			<div class="content">heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net<br /><br />Tradition has many stories to tell of this remarkable man, who is <br />commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation for Khan Sahib. <br />He was born in the Rammnad country and was originally a Hindu of the <br />Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took Service under a <br />European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed, served under <br />another European (who educated him), went to the Nawab's court, rose <br />rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and eventually, as has <br />been seen, became Commandant of all the Company's sepoys. His <br />executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report (see <br />below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and entitled 'A <br />view of the English interests in India'--which was republished in <br />Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and Madura 'his whole <br />administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was <br />unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were happily <br />combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge from <br />punishment.' It concludes by saying that his example shows <br />that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or complexion.'<br /><br /><br />Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the country, <br />renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very moderate sum <br />of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of 1759 and began <br />by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting avenues through <br />their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they fled, or <br />executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He went on to <br />reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had sobered all <br />the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even had the <br />audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without the knowledge <br />or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he offered to <br />lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven lakhs per <br />annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was enraged at this, <br />or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his masters-- <br />he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began to collect <br />troops.<br /><br />He rabels and is hanged, 1764 <br />In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him and he was <br />besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all deserted <br />him, but he held out until October 1764 with great energy and skill, <br />renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--he is said <br />to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and constantly employed <br />3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault with a <br />loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers) killed and wounded. <br />At the end of that time little real progress against him had been <br />made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded, but he was <br />treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in charge of the <br />French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles Campbell, who <br />commanded the English among the besiegers. He was ignominiously <br />hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of Madura, and his <br />body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was afterwards <br />erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to the left of the <br />read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and is known <br />as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'<br /><br />His character<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>hi <br />  <br />  the best book on this yusuf khan alias maduranayakam is from asian <br />  educational services<br />  &#40; those red leather books with gold embossed names that you see&#41;<br />  <br />  <br />  as swetha said that was a troubled time and you cant really pin <br />down <br />  a hero or a villian<br />  <br />  but I think this guy was a conteemprory of the marudhu sagodararkaL<br />  <br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran" <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Dear Mr Venkatesh;<br />    <br />    That was a fantastic article, really informative. <br />Marudhanayagam&#39;s <br />  life is<br />    very similar to the Mel Gibson movie "Braveheart".

			<div class="content">Mr Venkatesh;<br /><br />This is really a lot of information about Marudanayagam!!!<br />What a fantastic character this man must have been. He has been a<br />Hindu,learnt his 3 R's in a christian household,had an affair with a<br />Frenchwoman,married a parangi, and converted to Islam. Has there ever been a<br />more diverse individual? Maybe a complete book in English about this person<br />would be a best seller. The only way for letting the world know about our<br />heroes would be to write their memoirs in English and sell them abroad<br />through a renowned publisher. If only wishes were horses...<br />May our fabled land produce more Marudanayagam's<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 2/22/06, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net<br /> <br />  Tradition has many stories to tell of this remarkable man, who is<br />  commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation for Khan Sahib.<br />  He was born in the Rammnad country and was originally a Hindu of the<br />  Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took Service under a<br />  European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed, served under<br />  another European &#40;who educated him&#41;, went to the Nawab&#39;s court, rose<br />  rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and eventually, as has<br />  been seen, became Commandant of all the Company&#39;s sepoys. His<br />  executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report &#40;see<br />  below&#41; from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and entitled &#39;A<br />  view of the English interests in India&#39;--which was republished in<br />  Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and Madura &#39;his whole<br />  administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />  unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were happily<br />  combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge from<br />  punishment.&#39; It concludes by saying that his example shows<br />  that &#39;wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or complexion.&#39;<br /> <br /> <br />  Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />  The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the country,<br />  renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very moderate sum<br />  of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of 1759 and began<br />  by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting avenues through<br />  their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they fled, or<br />  executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He went on to<br />  reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had sobered all<br />  the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even had the<br />  audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without the knowledge<br />  or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he offered to<br />  lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven lakhs per<br />  annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was enraged at this,<br />  or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his masters--<br />  he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began to collect<br />  troops.<br /> <br />  He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />  In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him and he was<br />  besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all deserted<br />  him, but he held out until October 1764 with great energy and skill,<br />  renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense--he is said<br />  to have &#39;entirely repaired&#39; its east face and constantly employed<br />  3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault with a<br />  loss of 120 Europeans &#40;including nine officers&#41; killed and wounded.<br />  At the end of that time little real progress against him had been<br />  made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded, but he was<br />  treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in charge of the<br />  French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles Campbell, who<br />  commanded the English among the besiegers. He was ignominiously<br />  hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of Madura, and his<br />  body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was afterwards<br />  erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to the left of the<br />  read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and is known<br />  as &#39;Khan Sahib&#39;s pallivasal.&#39;<br /> <br />  His character<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"<br />   wrote:<br />   <br />   <br />    hi<br />   <br />    the best book on this yusuf khan alias maduranayakam is from asian<br />    educational services<br />    &#40; those red leather books with gold embossed names that you see&#41;<br />   <br />   <br />    as swetha said that was a troubled time and you cant really pin<br />  down<br />    a hero or a villian<br />   <br />    but I think this guy was a conteemprory of the marudhu sagodararkaL<br />   <br />    venketesh<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      Dear Mr Venkatesh;<br />     <br />      That was a fantastic article, really informative.<br />  Marudhanayagam&#39;s<br />    life is<br />      very similar to the Mel Gibson movie "Braveheart".

Did you mean Marudhanayagam? There is a mosque<br />    near<br />        my<br />          home in<br />            Madurai where they say his head is buried.

This Marudhanayagam was<br />  also<br />    a<br />          convert and<br />            they say the British could not kill him. Every time they<br />    thought<br />          they had<br />            killed him he came back! That is why the next time they<br />    killed<br />        him<br />          they<br />            separated his head from the body and buried them<br />  separately.<br />    I<br />          dont know<br />            where they buried his body.<br />            Can anybody elaborate on this?
