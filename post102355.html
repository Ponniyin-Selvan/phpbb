			<div class="content">Hi Diwakar,<br /><br />I dont know how you feel that "thiruvasagam has been<br />butchered." But I think he has only glorified<br />Thiruvasagam by rendering it in western classical<br />music.<br /><br />Last week I was in Paris and met my manager who is an<br />American and came down there for the meeting. We were<br />talking about this music and I presented him a CD. He<br />said that he already knew about this and it was<br />announced in the national radio in the USA as a first<br />attempt of its kind.<br /><br />Now the whole world talks about "Thiruvasagam" which<br />is only a glorification and adds a feather to our<br />hats. If an ancient Tamil poetry can be rendered in a<br />different musical form, how much precious it is and<br />imagine the vision the poet had too.<br /><br />If you have listened the 2nd song: No one could have<br />done "namachivaya vazga, nathanthal vazga" in such a<br />melting way!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- dhiwakar baskaran  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Venkatesh,<br /> <br />  oru vaasagam sonnaalum thiruvaasagamaa sonnenga.. i<br />  too am of the same opinion.

			<div class="content">dear Venkateswaran kasirajan,<br /><br />Good that even an American is aware of that... but all that i would tell us is what is called as "MARKETING"..Nothing more than this..<br /><br />Marketing is essential to get the initial numbers going or as what they call in cinema parlance as "Good Opening".. but , still i would maintain that justice has not been done to Manickavasagar....<br /><br />that is too evident in the packaging too . if you notice the packaging contains, pictures of ilaiyaraja, and not manickavasagar. Now don't tell me that , ther is no picture of manickavasagar, whati mean a picture is that an artist's impression . if that is the case, we do not have the photo of even any god.. there is not even a representatio of Shiva even in the form of Lingam.<br /><br />My opinion is that , ilaiyaraja has been packaged rather than Thiruvasagam.<br /><br />it is a god's sent gift for Ilaiyaraja who has not been able to release his Symphony earlier. it is a chance for him to portray to the world about his Genius. , though he might not have intentionally done that.. but it has turned out to be that.<br /><br />i would still maintain that in the rendition, "THE ESSENCE OF THIRUVASAGAM HAS BEEN LOST". now don'tt ell me that even foreigners appreciate it and that is the success of it.. Let me tel you, if we want a foreigner's appreciation, then it means still we favour slavery though in a different form.<br /><br />If acceptance and applause of foreigners is essential then there are numerous other lyrics that could have been used rather than Thiruvasagam...<br /><br />With Regards<br /><br />B.

			<div class="content">Dear Dhiwakar,<br /><br />I accept some of your views.<br /><br />When I bought the CD, I found that the period in which<br />the songs were written were not mentioned. But they<br />have mentioned that it was translated into English<br />during 19th Century.<br /><br />What they have done is to put icons of the chief<br />artists on the back side of the cover.<br /><br />I think we can forgive errors, in the light of the<br />bravity and magnanimousity of the work and Ilayaraja<br />definitely deserves his portrait on the front page.<br /><br />There are some people who classify everything as<br />'marketing' and dont look beyond that. I guess even<br />when Manicavasagar published his work, there might<br />have been some critics who remarked it as marketing...<br />What is cheap marketing and what is literature class<br />is decided by generations to come..

			<div class="content">Ok Guys, we need not criticize two geniuses Manickavasagar and<br />Ilayaraja. We are not qualified for that.<br />Different people have different opinion. Even Thiruvalluvar was criticised.<br />Let us stop here.<br /><br />Venkateswaran Kasirajan wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Dhiwakar,<br /> <br /> I accept some of your views.<br /> <br /> When I bought the CD, I found that the period in which<br /> the songs were written were not mentioned. But they<br /> have mentioned that it was translated into English<br /> during 19th Century.<br /> <br /> What they have done is to put icons of the chief<br /> artists on the back side of the cover.<br /> <br /> I think we can forgive errors, in the light of the<br /> bravity and magnanimousity of the work and Ilayaraja<br /> definitely deserves his portrait on the front page.<br /> <br /> There are some people who classify everything as<br /> &#39;marketing&#39; and dont look beyond that. I guess even<br /> when Manicavasagar published his work, there might<br /> have been some critics who remarked it as marketing...<br /> What is cheap marketing and what is literature class<br /> is decided by generations to come.. Today we stand<br /> here rendering Thiruvasagam in western classical<br /> music, that glorifies the poet a thousand years later.<br /> <br /> <br /> Best regards,</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Let me say it before I analyse it, I loved the music, it is a great<br />work.<br /><br />Now the Criticism.<br /><br />Instead of the music being a setting for Thiruvasagam, I felt that<br />irrespective of the lyrical composition, the music would have still<br />been great. So it is just Ilaiyaraj's musical artistry that comes<br />through and not whatever is the individual's souls expectation of<br />Thiruvasagam's spiritual essence. But then it could be argued that<br />each soul vibrates to a different tune. If so, then a "maestro"<br />should be able to touch all such souls in one way or the other.<br /><br />Media appreciation: It is not practical in today's world to ignore<br />the media or a global market. Every era has its own media and market<br />which do decide the success of a creation.<br /><br />Take for example Sekkiyazhar, he just elaborated in more reachable<br />form the existing works a Thiruthondar thogai/thiruvandhadhi. Thanks<br />to that he is canonised as the 64th Nayanmaar. In fact I would vote<br />to make A.P Nagarajan as the 65th Nayanmaar, for he did the same work<br />as Sekkiyar, for his "Thiruvilaiyadal", "Thiruvarutselvar" etc., are<br />the media from which many of this generation had thier initiation<br />into the saivite canon.<br /><br />I remember that many of the common people had a new found<br />appreciation of Devaram after "Thalapathy" was released with "Kunitha<br />Puruvamum.." implanted in the Rakkamma song.<br /><br />Shankar's Kadalan had a song from "Kutrala Kuravanji" - "Indariyo.."<br />And when "Oothukadu Venkatsubbiyers Alaipayudhey" featured in<br />Maniratnam's movie, I heard a comment in the theatre " Vairamuthu<br />ennama ezhutharuru paa" about that song <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So I am all for marketing old wines in new bottles, it will be a gain<br />to all parties concerned.
