			<div class="content">Religion is personal right. Every person has right to convert to any <br />religion he wants(provided he is not forced and misguided).<br />I don't agree calling oneself a Hindu,Muslim or Christian just bcos <br />one was born to Hindu,Muslim or Christian parent. Religion is <br />something u got to believe. If some one feels he is more attracted to <br />any other faith he has every right to do it. Thats our constitution- <br />Secular.<br />So it is duty of the government to take care the religious conversion <br />dosen't take place by force or for material benefits.<br />At the same time we as citizens should respect its individual right of <br />any person to preach and try to spread his religion and at the same <br />time, the right of person to convert to another faith. But the catch <br />is, it should be within some limits. I dont like Christians coming <br />into temple or temple region(Tirupati example) to propagate their <br />faith or a activist like bajrang dal who resort to communal <br />violence(to the level of killing people and raping nun in public) to <br />reconvert people of other faith to Hinduism.<br /><br />What about Guathama Bhudda, one of the greatest human beings ever born <br />in this world. When he had problem with the society around , he went <br />on a journey and he found a religion. It doesnt always mean a person <br />has to fight within his faith. Its a personal choice!<br /><br />Though at personal level I dont believe in conversion, I dont want to <br />indulge in critizising people who convert for it is a individual <br />right to change faith and I respect that right.<br /><br />Vairam<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Thirumalai Vinjamoor Venkatesh <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam,<br />  <br />  Let me clarify.

So being born into aÃ‚Â family of ardent <br />believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â (yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as his <br />inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, why <br />he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he didÃ‚Â not <br />haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />fight from within.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist.

They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they mixed <br />no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for this, <br />whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â too. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledgeÃ‚Â nor the <br />guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar or</div></blockquote>Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the faith.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Ã‚Â <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  ----- Original Message ----<br />  From: Vairam <br />  To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships ravana....<br />  <br />  <br />  Venkatesh,<br />  Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />  very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He also <br />  didnt oppose the different treatment&#40;different food system in school <br />  for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children&#41;. So every leader has <br />  +ves and -ves.<br />  So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included is <br />  not a right argument here.<br />  Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were</div></blockquote>different but <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>still the motive should be appreciated.<br />  I hope we don&#39;t argue more on who should be included and who <br />shouldn&#39;t <br />  be.<br />  <br />  Regards<br />  Vairam<br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Thirumalai Vinjamoor <br />Venkatesh <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Nanda, <br />    <br />    IÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â am surprised that you sayÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â EVR chose to fight, instead of <br />  gettingÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />  religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the faith and fight. He <br />did <br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all <br />  wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â "practising"ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â believed in God <br />and fought <br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />    <br />    In fact, whileÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â veryÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â valid <br />regarding <br />  the irrationalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and illogicalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â methods being followed, <br />IÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â think that <br />  he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â or tenets of Hinduism, <br />  before deciding to take onÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â it. On the other hand, all those four <br />  above andÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â thoseÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  <br />scriptures than EVR <br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the <br />  faith. <br />    <br />    So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we canÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â give to EVR is that, he <br />did <br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel with <br />  true rationalism.<br />    <br />    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or Pillayar <br />  withÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â chappals?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the discriminating <br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods?

Okay, he did not get converted to another<br />    religion, but he could not stay within the faith and fight. He did<br />    become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other<br />    hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all<br />    were "practising" Hindus, who very much believed in God and fought<br />    with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />     <br />      In fact, while some of EVR&#39;s argument were very valid regarding<br />    the irrational and illogical methods being followed, I think that<br />    he did not understand the true scriptures or tenets of Hinduism,<br />    before deciding to take on it. On the other hand, all those four<br />    above and those unsung heroes, understood the scriptures than EVR<br />    and that is what made them fight while still remaining within the<br />    faith.<br />     <br />      So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we can give to EVR is that, he did<br />    not get converted into another religion.

			<div class="content">Vairam,<br /><br />IÂ see your point. Even I am not against anyone who is converting to anotherÂ religion. I amÂ only questioning theseÂ methods used in the propaganda.Â In fact I believe in one Supreme God who is the Masterof the Entire Universe. CallÂ Him, Vishnu or Siva or the GodÂ saidby JesusÂ or Prophet, they are all one and the same. And do you know whoÂ said this. The Azhwars (and Nayanmars too but I dont have the reference of the songs). <br /><br />I have quoted this before.

Some one garland the idols with chappal<br />2. Some one do false propaganda denigrating the God of a particular religion<br /><br />The 2nd one is what is being done by the Missionaries, with the help of theGovernment and the Media houses, which is what I denounce.<br /><br />Hope I clarified.

Every person has right to convert to any <br />religion he wants(provided he is not forced and misguided).<br />I don't agree calling oneself a Hindu,Muslim or Christian just bcos <br />one was born to Hindu,Muslim or Christian parent. Religion is <br />something u got to believe. If some one feels he is more attracted to <br />any other faith he has every right to do it. Thats our constitution- <br />Secular.<br />So it is duty of the government to take care the religious conversion <br />dosen't take place by force or for material benefits.<br />At the same time we as citizens should respect its individual right of <br />any person to preach and try to spread his religion and at the same <br />time, the right of person to convert to another faith. But the catch <br />is, it should be within some limits. I dont like Christians coming <br />into temple or temple region(Tirupati example) to propagate their <br />faith or a activist like bajrang dal who resort to communal <br />violence(to the level of killing people and raping nun in public) to <br />reconvert people of other faith to Hinduism.<br /><br />What about Guathama Bhudda, one of the greatest human beings ever born <br />in this world. When he had problem with the society around , he went <br />on a journey and he found a religion. It doesnt always mean a person <br />has to fight within his faith. Its a personal choice!<br /><br />Though at personal level I dont believe in conversion, I dont want to <br />indulge in critizising people who convert for it is a individual <br />right to change faith and I respect that right.<br /><br />Vairam<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Thirumalai Vinjamoor Venkatesh <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam,<br />  <br />  Let me clarify.

Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />  religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â the faith and fight. He <br />did <br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all <br />  wereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â "practising"Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â believed in God <br />and fought <br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />    <br />    In fact, whileÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument wereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â veryÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â valid <br />regarding <br />  the irrationalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â and illogicalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â methods being followed, <br />IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â think that <br />  he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â or tenets of Hinduism, <br />  before deciding to take onÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â it. On the other hand, all those four <br />  above andÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â thoseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â theÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  <br />scriptures than EVR <br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining withinÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â the <br />  faith. <br />    <br />    So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we canÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â give to EVR is that, he <br />did <br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel with <br />  true rationalism.<br />    <br />    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or Pillayar <br />  withÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â chappals?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the discriminating <br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins <br />are <br />  notÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â taking <br />on <br />  theÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â discriminating Brahmins, heÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â and other fellow atheists have <br />taken <br />  upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they cannot <br />  sustain the take. <br />    <br />    So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />  fought for theÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />faith.<br />    Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 11:25:26 AM<br />    Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />ravana....<br />    <br />    <br />    Please do add "Periyar" to this list.

All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />    Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />    achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to <br />the <br />    credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />    but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />liberation <br />    through surrender.<br />    <br />    What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about <br />    Buddhism?

I dont like Christians coming<br />into temple or temple region(Tirupati example) to propagate their<br />faith or a activist like bajrang dal who resort to communal<br />violence(to the level of killing people and raping nun in public) to<br />reconvert people of other faith to Hinduism.<br /><br />What about Guathama Bhudda, one of the greatest human beings ever born<br />in this world. When he had problem with the society around , he went<br />on a journey and he found a religion. It doesnt always mean a person<br />has to fight within his faith. Its a personal choice!<br /><br />Though at personal level I dont believe in conversion, I dont want to<br />indulge in critizising people who convert for it is a individual<br />right to change faith and I respect that right.<br /><br />Vairam<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Thirumalai Vinjamoor Venkatesh<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam,<br /> <br />  Let me clarify.

			<div class="content">Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that both <br />EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.<br /><br />I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt them, in <br />TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any faith. In <br />fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />other side. <br /><br />Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it with <br />knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know how to <br />do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.<br /><br />I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love to <br />aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on Amazon).<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Thirumalai Vinjamoor Venkatesh <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Vairam,<br />  <br />  Let me clarify.

It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />  makes no sense to argue that EVR fought &#39;within&#39; or &#39;without&#39; <br />  boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any faith. <br />In <br />  fact Gandhi&#39;s own disagreement with EVR was this &#39;eye for an eye&#39; <br />  approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />  other side. <br />  <br />  Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it with <br />  knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know how <br />to <br />  do.

Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />based <br />  teaching system.Ã‚Â He too had faultered here and there. But remember, <br />  but for RajajiÃ‚Â and UVSÃ‚Â Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚Â all the <br />  oppressedÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />  happened now.Ã‚Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.<br />    <br />    And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for the <br />  social cause. IÃ‚Â only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />  within the faith. AsÃ‚Â all of us know, his parentsÃ‚Â and ancestors <br />were <br />  all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚Â family of ardent <br />  believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as his <br />  inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />  believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, why <br />  he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />didÃ‚Â not <br />  haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />  fight from within.<br />    <br />    I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist. But my <br />  upfront question was why toÃ‚Â garland the idols with chappals, just <br />  toÃ‚Â exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚Â And is this act, not <br />similar <br />  to whatÃ‚Â a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚Â the churches today. When a <br />  Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚Â this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />  Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />    <br />    This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />  Sunnambu".Ã‚Â &#40;PleaseÃ‚Â do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />  towardsÃ‚Â you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />  decried in my previous post&#41;<br />    <br />    Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />  league ofÃ‚Â those who fought forÃ‚Â social upliftment while remaining <br />  within the fight.Ã‚Â And remember, to comeÃ‚Â out of the faith and fight <br />  against it is a very easy, butÃ‚Â think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />  Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚Â had to face whileÃ‚Â fighting for the <br />  cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />  particular.Ã‚Â Needless toÃ‚Â say that this extends to everyone <br />  whoÃ‚Â fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚Â socialÃ‚Â equality while <br />  remaining within the faith. <br />    <br />    Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â Nayanmars,Ã‚Â impress EVR. <br />  Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />  discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they <br />mixed <br />  no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />  theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />  theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />  this, whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from <br />  theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â too. <br />    <br />    SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledgeÃ‚Â nor <br />  the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar <br />  or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the <br />faith.<br />    Ã‚Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: Vairam <br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships ravana....<br />    <br />    <br />    Venkatesh,<br />    Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />    very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.

Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />based <br />  teaching system.Ã‚Â He too had faultered here and there. But remember, <br />  but for RajajiÃ‚Â and UVSÃ‚Â Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚Â all the <br />  oppressedÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />  happened now.Ã‚Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.<br />    <br />    And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />the <br />  social cause. IÃ‚Â only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />  within the faith. AsÃ‚Â all of us know, his parentsÃ‚Â and ancestors were <br />  all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚Â family of ardent <br />  believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as his <br />  inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />  believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, why <br />  he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />didÃ‚Â not <br />  haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />  fight from within.<br />    <br />    I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist. But my <br />  upfront question was why toÃ‚Â garland the idols with chappals, just <br />  toÃ‚Â exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚Â And is this act, not similar <br />  to whatÃ‚Â a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚Â the churches today. When a <br />  Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚Â this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />  Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />    <br />    This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />  Sunnambu".Ã‚Â &#40;PleaseÃ‚Â do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />  towardsÃ‚Â you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />  decried in my previous post&#41;<br />    <br />    Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />  league ofÃ‚Â those who fought forÃ‚Â social upliftment while remaining <br />  within the fight.Ã‚Â And remember, to comeÃ‚Â out of the faith and fight <br />  against it is a very easy, butÃ‚Â think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />  Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚Â had to face whileÃ‚Â fighting for the <br />  cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />  particular.Ã‚Â Needless toÃ‚Â say that this extends to everyone <br />  whoÃ‚Â fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚Â socialÃ‚Â equality while <br />  remaining within the faith. <br />    <br />    Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â Nayanmars,Ã‚Â impress EVR. <br />  Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />  discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they <br />mixed <br />  no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />  theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />  theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />  this, whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from <br />  theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â too. <br />    <br />    SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledgeÃ‚Â nor <br />  the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar <br />  or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the <br />faith.<br />    Ã‚Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: Vairam <br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships ravana....<br />    <br />    <br />    Venkatesh,<br />    Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />    very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.

Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />    religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the faith and fight. He <br />  did <br />    become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />other <br />    hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />Iyer, <br />  all <br />    wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â "practising"ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â believed in God <br />  and fought <br />    with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />      <br />      In fact, whileÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â veryÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â valid <br />  regarding <br />    the irrationalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and illogicalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â methods being followed, <br />  IÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â think that <br />    he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â or tenets of Hinduism, <br />    before deciding to take onÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â it. On the other hand, all those four <br />    above andÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â thoseÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  <br />  scriptures than EVR <br />    and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />  withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the <br />    faith. <br />      <br />      So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we canÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â give to EVR is that, he <br />  did <br />    not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />one <br />    should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel <br />with <br />    true rationalism.<br />      <br />      And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />well, <br />    then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />  Pillayar <br />    withÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â chappals?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the <br />  discriminating <br />    Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />Brahmins <br />  are <br />    notÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â taking <br />  on <br />    theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â discriminating Brahmins, heÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and other fellow atheists <br />  have taken <br />    upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />  cannot <br />    sustain the take. <br />      <br />      So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />    fought for theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />  faith.<br />      ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      ----- Original Message ----<br />      From: Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />      To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />      Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 11:25:26 AM<br />      Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />  ravana....<br />      <br />      <br />      Please do add "Periyar" to this list.

It is not right to oppose anything blindly.

Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />  based <br />    teaching system.Ã‚Â He too had faultered here and there. But <br />remember, <br />    but for RajajiÃ‚Â and UVSÃ‚Â Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚Â all the <br />    oppressedÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />    happened now.Ã‚Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />them.<br />      <br />      And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />    social cause. IÃ‚Â only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />    within the faith. AsÃ‚Â all of us know, his parentsÃ‚Â and ancestors <br />were <br />    all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚Â family of <br />ardent <br />    believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚Â &#40;yes, I would termÃ‚Â it as <br />his <br />    inability&#41; to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />    believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚Â reasons given, toÃ‚Â explain, <br />why <br />    he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />  didÃ‚Â not <br />    haveÃ‚Â either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />to <br />    fight from within.<br />      <br />      I amÃ‚Â even fine with the fact that heÃ‚Â became an atheist. But <br />my <br />    upfront question was why toÃ‚Â garland the idols with chappals, <br />just <br />    toÃ‚Â exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚Â And is this act, not <br />similar <br />    to whatÃ‚Â a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚Â the churches today. When a <br />    Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚Â this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />is <br />    Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.<br />      <br />      This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />    Sunnambu".Ã‚Â &#40;PleaseÃ‚Â do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />    towardsÃ‚Â you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />    decried in my previous post&#41;<br />      <br />      Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />    league ofÃ‚Â those who fought forÃ‚Â social upliftment while <br />remaining <br />    within the fight.Ã‚Â And remember, to comeÃ‚Â out of the faith and <br />fight <br />    against it is a very easy, butÃ‚Â think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />    Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚Â had to face whileÃ‚Â fighting for <br />the <br />    cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />    particular.Ã‚Â Needless toÃ‚Â say that this extends to everyone <br />    whoÃ‚Â fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚Â socialÃ‚Â equality <br />while <br />    remaining within the faith. <br />      <br />      Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â Nayanmars,Ã‚Â impressEVR. <br />    Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />    discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚Â they <br />  mixed <br />    no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />    theÃ‚Â extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate <br />in <br />    theÃ‚Â name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />    this, whileÃ‚Â others can given ample references from <br />    theÃ‚Â NayanmarsÃ‚Â too. <br />      <br />      SimplyÃ‚Â put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />knowledgeÃ‚Â nor <br />    the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚Â an <br />AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar <br />    or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚Â while remaining with in the <br />  faith.<br />      Ã‚Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      ----- Original Message ----<br />      From: Vairam <br />      To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />      Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 12:16:32 PM<br />      Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships ravana....<br />      <br />      <br />      Venkatesh,<br />      Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />very <br />      very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.

Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />      religion, but he could not stay withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the faith and fight. <br />He <br />    did <br />      become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />      hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />    all <br />      wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â "practising"ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â believed in <br />God <br />    and fought <br />      with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.<br />        <br />        In fact, whileÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â some of EVR&#39;s argument <br />wereÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â veryÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â valid <br />    regarding <br />      the irrationalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and illogicalÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â methods being followed, <br />    IÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â think that <br />      he did not understand the true scripturesÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â or tenets of <br />Hinduism, <br />      before deciding to take onÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â it. On the other hand, all those <br />four <br />      above andÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â thoseÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  <br />    scriptures than EVR <br />      and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />    withinÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â the <br />      faith. <br />        <br />        So <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, the only credit that we canÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â give to EVR is that, <br />he <br />    did <br />      not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />      should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn&#39;t gel <br />  with <br />      true rationalism.<br />        <br />        And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />      then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />    Pillayar <br />      withÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â chappals?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â  If EVR&#39;s grudge was against the <br />    discriminating <br />      Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />  Brahmins <br />    are <br />      notÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />toÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â taking <br />    on <br />      theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â discriminating Brahmins, heÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â and other fellow atheists <br />    have taken <br />      upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />    cannot <br />      sustain the take. <br />        <br />        So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />who <br />      fought for theÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />    faith.<br />        ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        ----- Original Message ----<br />        From: Nandakumar Selvaraj <br />        To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />        Sent: Friday, 10 October, 2008 11:25:26 AM<br />        Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: village which worships <br />    ravana....<br />        <br />        <br />        Please do add "Periyar" to this list.

All epic based vilains be it <br />Ravana <br />  or <br />        Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />        achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is <br />to <br />    the <br />        credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style <br />    evil <br />        but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />    liberation <br />        through surrender.<br />        <br />        What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />    about <br />        Buddhism?
