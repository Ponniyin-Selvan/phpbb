Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates.

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />      happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />      There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />       <br />        Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />       <br />        1. Huns invasion<br />        The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />      the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />      as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />      made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />      reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />      their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />      North India.<br />       <br />        2. After Harshavardhana<br />        After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />      of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />      republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />      republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />      India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />      any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />      into small states.<br />        If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />      could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />      disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />      power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />       <br />        3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />        The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />      numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />      decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />      decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />      annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />      part against Muslim invasion.<br />        But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />      Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />      Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />      way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />      Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />      India.<br />       <br />        4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />        After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />      North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />      were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />      the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />      didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />      any contacts with Northwest India?<br />        When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />      temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />      temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />      kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />      East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />      conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />      to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />       <br />        5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />        Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />      nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />      of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />      in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />      commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />      rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />      of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />        The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />      inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />      capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />      Rajput hands.<br />        The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />      Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />      Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />      as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />      these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />      general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />      over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />      came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />      fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />      army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />      plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />      army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />      costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />      poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />      been removed.<br />       <br />        The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />      Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />      apparently different.<br />       <br />        6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />        Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />      King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />      taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />      and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />      title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />        To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />      marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />      Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />      success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />      when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />      many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />      troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />        This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />      changed history.<br />       <br />        7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />        The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />      Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />      Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />      present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />      grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />      Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />      battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />      spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />      and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />      sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />      Vijayanagara.<br />        The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />      some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />      the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />      caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />      the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />      the last great southern empire in India.<br />       <br />        8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />        The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />      1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />      aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />      Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />      Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />      leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />      Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />      Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />      Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />        After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />      themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />      years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br />       <br />        Thanks,<br />        Dhamo<br />       <br />        ---------------------------------<br />        Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br />  <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        ---------------------------------<br />        Yahoo!

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!

What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History. <br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered <br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go backto <br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle <br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North <br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they <br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers. <br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas hada <br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and <br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great <br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from <br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas <br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other <br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast.Cholas <br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga <br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded <br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled anarea<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty <br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could <br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of <br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his <br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to <br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi andhis<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s <br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had <br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different. <br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India, <br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41; <br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree <br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle. <br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, <br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held <br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a <br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of <br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that <br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under AhmadShah <br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favourof the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the <br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended,and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar. <br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them. <br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Nothing can be forced in to anyone. I do not think any of the schools is teaching history now a days. they usually ask the students to read in the class( atleast that's how my teachers taught me).<br /><br />I feel the reason why tamil history is neglected in the history books are either the persons setting the syallabi is not aware of history of tamil nadu(which is very unlikely) or they would have felt there is not enough visual evidence for the history( some thing like Qutub Minar, Agra Fort, Shivaji's fort at Maharastra). There are very few monuments to tell the students to explain the glory of it like Tanjai Periya Koil, Mamallapuram.<br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />Rahul,<br /><br />Well said, point taken.. but again, if the child needs to have interest in history, then it should start at home..

It should be fun learning history. then it can be taught in 11th and 12th. There is already enough pressure to get marks..history should relieve the pressure and bring an element of fun to the experience. Learning about Ashoka, Krishnadeva raya, Indus valley civilisation should be fun. Exams should not be conducted on where Ashoka planted trees and who was the last Mughal emperor.<br /><br />History is learnt to keep our culture alive and let the present generation learn about past mistakes.

Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!

I do not think any of the schools isteaching history now a days. they usually ask the students to read in the class( atleast that's how my teachers taught me).  <br /><br />I feel the reason why tamil history is neglected in the history books areeither the persons setting the syallabi is not aware of history of tamil nadu(which is very unlikely) or they would have felt there is not enough visual evidence for the history( some thing like Qutub Minar, Agra Fort, Shivaji's fort at Maharastra). There are very few monuments to tell the studentsto explain the glory of it like Tanjai Periya Koil, Mamallapuram. <br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br /><br />Rahul,<br /><br />Well said, point taken.. but again, if the child needs to have interestin history, then it should start at home..

It should be fun learning history. then it can be taught in 11th and 12th. There is already enough pressure to get marks..history should relieve the pressure and bring an element of fun to the experience. Learning about Ashoka, Krishnadeva raya, Indus valley civilisation should be fun. Exams should notbe conducted on where Ashoka planted trees and who was the last Mughal emperor. <br /><br />History is learnt to keep our culture alive and let the present generation learn about past mistakes.

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History. <br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered <br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent butthat<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire andit got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to <br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle <br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North <br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they <br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslimrulers. <br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This causedthe<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a <br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at leastplayed a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and <br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain aGreat <br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from <br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas <br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other <br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas <br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga <br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar.

I do not think any of the schools is teaching history now a days. they usually ask the students to read in the class( atleast that's how my teachers taught me).<br /><br />I feel the reason why tamil history is neglected in the history books are either the persons setting the syallabi is not aware of history of tamil nadu(which is very unlikely) or they would have felt there is not enough visual evidence for the history( some thing like Qutub Minar, Agra Fort, Shivaji's fort at Maharastra). There are very few monuments to tell the students to explain the glory of it like Tanjai Periya Koil, Mamallapuram.<br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />Rahul,<br /><br />Well said, point taken.. but again, if the child needs to have interest in history, then it should start at home..

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years.

			<div class="content">I have observed in many instances, a person very good about historical facts or culture is not recognised by his environment itself. We can see many people who lack interest in History or culture and they merely excuse themselves as these things are old and those things are not of any importance to their personal growth.<br /><br />We find very less persons interested in taking pride of our own historial acheivments and past glory. Many people try to emulate the western practices and feel guilt and shame in following our age old customs.<br /><br />The most irony is if someone takes time to explain things about History of temple or its architectural importance normally he gets very less audience to hear and the person's effort or that knowledge is considered as waste of time.<br /><br /><acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym> awareness of our glorious past should be emphasised to all. Actually we are slowing loosing a lot to modernisation, our habits, our culture, our food, our architecture, our dress and the list is pretty long. To be frank the pride of our habits is not within ourselves and most Indians complain about the Indian habits.<br /><br />The most painful thing is slowing the great native Literature works are being read in English through its translations only. Our language has a well defined Grammer and its beauty and excellence has no match, and we still like to read through its translations just like a foreigner.<br /><br />Thanks & Regards,<br />Dhamo<br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> its such a comical thing, that many people dont know about the crowning glory and achievements of our ancestors.. this is very much like a vadivel joke..<br /><br />Ferway overseas  wrote: Dear Friends,<br /><br />You know one thing<br />I ask two days before my staff reg age of tanjavoor temple he said about 135 years old<br />You know the tragedy he was studied in famous school in tirupur<br />this is how our history live in school<br /><br />Thanks & Regards<br /><br />Jegadheesh M<br /><br />Manivell Tex<br />37, MGR Nagar<br />P.N.

I do not think any of the schools is teaching history now a days. they usually ask the students to read in the class( atleast that's how my teachers taught me).<br /><br />I feel the reason why tamil history is neglected in the history books are either the persons setting the syallabi is not aware of history of tamil nadu(which is very unlikely) or they would have felt there is not enough visual evidence for the history( some thing like Qutub Minar, Agra Fort, Shivaji's fort at Maharastra). There are very few monuments to tell the students to explain the glory of it like Tanjai Periya Koil, Mamallapuram.<br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />Rahul,<br /><br />Well said, point taken.. but again, if the child needs to have interest in history, then it should start at home..

It should be fun learning history. then it can be taught in 11th and 12th. There is already enough pressure to get marks..history should relieve the pressure and bring an element of fun to the experience. Learning about Ashoka, Krishnadeva raya, Indus valley civilisation should be fun. Exams should not be conducted on where Ashoka planted trees and who was the last Mughal emperor.<br /><br />History is learnt to keep our culture alive and let the present generation learn about past mistakes. It should not be forced upon.

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History. <br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered <br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;tgo back to <br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle <br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back tosmall<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North <br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they <br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers. <br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a <br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have atleast played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and <br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are greatin their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great <br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from <br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled smallkingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas <br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other <br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni.Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas <br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;ttry their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga <br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded <br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty <br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed thatthey could <br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of <br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his <br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to <br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguardof Sanga&#39;s <br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rivalto Babur had <br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the FirstBattle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different. <br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India, <br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41; <br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree <br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panicamong the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle. <br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, <br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held <br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured inthe<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a <br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory forthe<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of <br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagarcity hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding itback, that <br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah <br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the <br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar. <br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their pastglorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them. <br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!

It should be fun learning history. then it can be taught in 11th and 12th. There is already enough pressure to get marks..history should relieve the pressure and bring an element of fun to the experience. Learning about Ashoka, Krishnadeva raya, Indus valley civilisation should be fun. Exams should not be conducted on where Ashoka planted trees and who was the last Mughal emperor.<br /><br />History is learnt to keep our culture alive and let the present generation learn about past mistakes. It should not be forced upon. The child should be happy learning history.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br />On 9/14/06, AVANISHIAPPAN SHRISUPRIYA  wrote: Hi Suganya mam<br />You are very Correct and True .<br />and we can also study a history in 11th and 12 th too.Our Syllabus are repeated from the beginning to end as a History Student in Schools I too know and experienced this<br /><br />Our History syllabus wants to be changed and give a chance to our froth coming generations to know abt our greatest personalities of Our beloved nation and it also encourages them to be Patriot towards our nation too.<br /><br />Sorry Friendz -If any thing I said Wrong<br /><br />Thanks for giving this chance in this debate<br /><br /><br />Anbudan<br />Supriyaa<br />New Member Of this Group From: Tiruppur<br />Suganya madam - Ennaium Koncham namma groupil ullavarkalluku Introduce Panni Vaingalen - Plz<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Suganya  wrote:<br /><br />Rahul,<br /><br />Edhukku 2 years extra aaganum....<br /><br />History as a subject it comes from standards 1st to 10th.

Those events makes us to think, &#39;Why it<br />    happened like that? What would have happened if it was otherwise?&#39;<br />    There are many such incidents in Indian History.<br />     <br />      Listing out some that I consider to be very crucial.<br />     <br />      1. Huns invasion<br />      The Huns invasions by the end of 5th century caused<br />    the end to the Great Imperial Gupta Empire. Guptas age is considered<br />    as Golden age. They resisted the Huns to a greater extent but that<br />    made them weak, caused the disintegration of their empire and it got<br />    reduced to multiple Independent kingdoms. Guptas didn&#39;t go back to<br />    their glorious past. They were the last prominent dynasty that ruled<br />    North India.<br />     <br />      2. After Harshavardhana<br />      After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle<br />    of the sixth century C.E., North India reverted back to small<br />    republics and small monarchial states. Harsha united the small<br />    republics to form a great empire that includes most of the North<br />    India. He ruled for 41 years. After Harsha&#39;s death, apparently without<br />    any heirs, his empire died with him. The kingdom disintegrated rapidly<br />    into small states.<br />      If anyone would have inherited the empire found by Harsha, they<br />    could have easily lasted for at least one or two centuries. The<br />    disintegration of the Harsha&#39;s Empire and the chaos created by the<br />    power vacuum in North India really helped the Invading Muslim rulers.<br />     <br />      3. Pallavas-Chalukyas wars<br />      The rivalry between the Pallavas and Chalukyas caused<br />    numerous battles from 7th Century to 8th century. This caused the<br />    decline of both the Empires. Neither Pallavas nor Chalukyas had a<br />    decisive victory. If Chalukyas had eliminated Pallavas they could have<br />    annexed some parts of North India or they would have at least played a<br />    part against Muslim invasion.<br />      But Pallavas had two enemies to face &#40;Chalukyas and<br />    Pandyas&#41; that paved way for their decline and the emergence of<br />    Imperial Chola Empire. Chalukyas and Pallavas are great in their own<br />    way, but rivalry between them didn&#39;t allow them to maintain a Great<br />    Empire and more importantly their presence made no impact on the North<br />    India.<br />     <br />      4. North and South India&#39;s political disconnection.<br />      After the Great Harshavardhana no other king from<br />    North India emerged to form an Empire, they ruled small kingdoms and<br />    were quite often engaged in war among themselves. By the 9th Century,<br />    the South India was under the rule of Imperial Cholas. Why the Cholas<br />    didn&#39;t tried to annex some parts of Northwest India. Whether they had<br />    any contacts with Northwest India?<br />      When the Tanjore&#39;s Great Temple and other chola<br />    temples were built, in the same century Somnath temple and other<br />    temples were devastated and looted by Mahmud of Ghazni. Why Crusade<br />    kind of wars didn&#39;t happened? Rajendra conquered North India along the<br />    East coast, why such an effort was not done towards West Coast. Cholas<br />    conquered Southeast Asian Kingdoms, but why they didn&#39;t try their hand<br />    to save the North India where numerous Temples were destroyed.<br />     <br />      5.Babur&#39;s Battles with Rajput Rana Sanga<br />      Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless<br />    nights because of continuing worries over Rana Sanga, the Rajput ruler<br />    of Mewar. The Rajputs had, prior to Babur&#39;s intervention, succeeded<br />    in conquering some of territory of the Sultanate. They ruled an area<br />    commonly known as "Rajputana". It was not a unified kingdom, but<br />    rather a confederacy of principalities, under the informal suzerainty<br />    of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.<br />      The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties<br />    inflicted by Lodhi on Babur&#39;s forces, and believed that they could<br />    capture Delhi, and possibly all Hindustan, bringing it back into Hindu<br />    Rajput hands.<br />      The two armies fought each other forty miles west of Agra at<br />    Khanwa. In a possibly apocryphal tale referred in Antiquities of<br />    Rajasthan, Babur is supposed to have sent about 1,500 choice cavalry<br />    as an advance guard to attack Sanga. Sanga&#39;s Rajputs heavily defeated<br />    these. Babur then wanted to discuss peace terms. Sanga sent his<br />    general Silhadi &#40;Shiladitya&#41; to the parley. Babur is said to have won<br />    over this general by promising him an independent kingdom. Silhadi<br />    came back and reported that Babur did not want peace and preferred to<br />    fight. The Battle of Khanwa began on March 17, 1527 Silhadi and his<br />    army left the field. Whatever the truth of this tale, it seems<br />    plausible that a treacherous Tomar who led the vanguard of Sanga&#39;s<br />    army at Khanwa went over to Babur, causing Sanga to retreat and<br />    costing him a likely victory. Within a year he was dead, probably<br />    poisoned by one of his own ministers, and a major rival to Babur had<br />    been removed.<br />     <br />      The Battle of Khanwa is more important than the First Battle of<br />    Panipat, for if Rana Sanga had won, India&#39;s history would have been<br />    apparently different.<br />     <br />      6. Second Battle of Panipat-1556<br />      Hemu &#40;Hemchandra&#41; was a military chief of the Afghan<br />    King Muhammad Adil Shah was seeking to expel the Mughals from India,<br />    taking advantage of Humayun&#39;s death, Hemu marched to Agra and Delhi<br />    and occupied it without difficulty, and became the ruler under the<br />    title &#39;Raja Vikramaditya&#39;.<br />      To counter this, Bairam Khan &#40;Akbar&#39;s guardian&#41;<br />    marched towards Delhi. On November 5 both the armies met at Panipat.<br />    Hemu with a large army including 1,500 war elephants had initial<br />    success. There was a pitched battle and Hemu was on a winning spree<br />    when a stray arrow struck him in the eye. He fell unconscious. As in<br />    many other battles, the loss of the leader caused panic among the<br />    troops and turned the tide of the battle. The Mughals won the battle.<br />      This is an example of a one-day event that could have<br />    changed history.<br />     <br />      7. Battle of Talikota &#40;January 26, 1565&#41;<br />      The Deccan sultanates of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,<br />    Bijapur and Golconda who had formed a grand alliance, met the<br />    Vijayanagar army at Talikota, on the banks of the Krishna River, in<br />    present day Karnataka state. Some minor Hindu kingdoms that held<br />    grudges against the Vijayanagara Empire also aided the sultanates.<br />    Rama Raya the chief of Vijayanagar army was captured in the<br />    battlefield and beheaded; his head was put on display as a trophy on a<br />    spear. The entire Vijayanagar army was struck with panic and disarray<br />    and started retreating resulting a complete victory for the<br />    sultanates. What followed was pillaging and the destruction of<br />    Vijayanagara.<br />      The loss was more than, that it should have been, for<br />    some reasons they occupants of the Splendid Vijayanagar city hearing<br />    the defeat in war fled and didn&#39;t thought of holding it back, that<br />    caused its complete destruction. The battle spelt the death knell for<br />    the large Hindu kingdoms in India, and it also started the decline of<br />    the last great southern empire in India.<br />     <br />      8. Third Battle of Panipat<br />      The Third Battle of Panipat took place on January 14,<br />    1761 at Panipat, between the Maratha forces of north-western India<br />    aiding their allies, the Mughals, and Afghan forces under Ahmad Shah<br />    Abdali. The match up would have been rather one sided in favour of the<br />    Marathas had not their own cavalry decided to charge prematurely<br />    leading to their defeat. Both forces were so heavily attrited that the<br />    Mughal Empire fell, the expansion of the Maratha&#39;s power ended, and<br />    Ahmad Shah&#39;s Durrani Empire suffered continual attacks by the growing<br />    Sikh power and eventually retired to the north of Kandahar.<br />      After this war, the Marathas faced problems within<br />    themselves and they never again came back to their past glorious<br />    years. They resisted the Britishers, but that was too much for them.<br />     <br />      Thanks,<br />      Dhamo<br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Get your email and more, right on the new Yahoo.com<br /><br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      ---------------------------------<br />      Yahoo!
