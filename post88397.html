			<div class="content">But, <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> indeed fight agaist Gazni, in his way back to <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram">GKC</acronym> after <br />vanquishing Pala's and Kosala's.<br /><br />Creating something is tough, but sustaining it is more tough, thats <br />where all kingdoms, went down. Name it, Cholas, Cheras, or Pandyas. <br />This needs Valour, values and genius. Cholas lacked valour in Raja <br />Raja III, which proved fatal.

			<div class="content">Very true...every system tends towards instability. Nothing is more <br />permanent than change itself - it would call for great flair and <br />governance to keep together a kingdom of such size and complexity. <br />We are talking of kings holding together people under their rule for <br />century's together...On the flip side - imagine the power and <br />absolute power at that..no wonder the princes were tutored by <br />eminent gurus and kings advised by illustrious ministers to let them <br />not stray from the right path - when democratic governments cannot <br />deliver theirs and people lose faith within even their elected <br />terms..<br /><br />the need for a king - as advised by the great beeshma:<br /><br />"Beeshma said: Â…Neither kingship nor<br />king was there in the beginning, neither<br />scepter nor the bearer of the scepter. All<br />people protected one another another by means of<br />righteous conduct (dharma). Thus, while<br />protecting one another by means of righteous<br />conduct, O Bharata, men eventually<br />fell into a state of spiritual lassitude<br />[weariness]. Then delusion overcame<br />themÂ… their sense of righteous conduct<br />was lost. When understanding was lost,<br />all menÂ… became victims of greed."<br /><br />Later the god Vishnu chooses "Â… that one person among mortals who<br />alone is worthy of high eminence." A man named Virajas is brought<br />forth and he becomes the first king.<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>After reading through <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> &#39;Colas&#39; I am somehow convinced that we <br />  have given short change to the Chola kings who followed <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>.
