			<div class="content">I am reading a fantastic book by John Keay called<br />'India - A History'. Not just a history but an actual<br />analysis of the artifacts and the inscriptions through<br />which the history is derived, peppered with very<br />interesting anecdotes of the various archeologists and<br />linguists who have helped unravel the history of<br />India. Currently I am reading the history of India<br />around 300AD and I find it interesting to note that he<br />has written extensively on the cultural influence of<br />India in the south east Asian countries. He uses the<br />evidences of the travellers and the actual settlements<br />in Malay peninsula and the Mekong valley area. He uses<br />references from Chinese resources which mention the<br />Indian settlements in these areas during the first<br />centuries after Christ. Infact the Funan dynasty in<br />the Khmer region (includes Vietnam and Cambodia) is<br />said to have been founded by a Indian Brahmin named<br />Kaudiniya and his Khmer queen Naga Soma in the first<br />century AD. There have been reports of the<br />missionaries sent by Asoka who were the first bearers<br />of Indian civilization in these areas. Keay also<br />mentions of an island named Mathura in Indonesia which<br />clearly is inspired by the Indian city names of<br />Mathura/Madurai. There were merchant communities that<br />operated in these areas from the Greaco-Roman times<br />and there is proof in the form of the Roman coins<br />found and the inscriptions found in these areas (in<br />Pallava scripts, which are nothing but Tamil-Brahmi).<br />What Keay argues is that Indians never ruled these<br />areas but were mainly traders and there may have been<br />raids by Indian kings in these areas to protect the<br />trade interests(from Pallavas to Cholas). But these<br />areas were Indianized to a higher level due to<br />influence of the Hindu epics and the presence of the<br />trading community which usually settled down and never<br />thought of going back home.<br />Thus I think it is very doubtful that the Pallavas<br />built anything on Java/Sumatra and the article cited<br />has very thin evidence as to that fact. Infact I see<br />an article on a local Hindu king using the pallava<br />scripts and I am not sure how that authenticates that<br />the Pallavas built anything on these islands. If there<br />is a inscription in Pallava script naming Mahendra<br />varman, that is iron-clad evidence of this fact not<br />just the usage of Pallava script(which was used from<br />the second century AD much before pallavas).<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />"'I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, Sir,' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself you see.'"<br />-Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div>

			<div class="content">not sure if this was discussed earlier - the writings are supposed <br />to be in pallava script with some more not yet deciphered.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/frm00160.html">http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/frm00160.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Dear friends<br />There are ruins of numerous Hindu temples I find scattered in this <br />archipelic country, especially in the island of Jawa and I am told <br />that the most ancient of them are the ones built by the Pallavas <br />during 6th / 7th Century. I suppose that of St.Arasu / Mahendra <br />Pallava period. Here is a piece authenticating what I hear often, <br />published in the Jakarta Post recently.<br /><br />Western Java's history written on stones<br /><br />By Ida Indawati Khouw <br /><br />Many may be unaware that flood problems in the capital Jakarta,date <br />back to ancient times. The evidence is on ancient boulders, which <br />also show that Jakarta was part of the ancient Tarumanagara kingdom. <br /><br />JAKARTA (JP): The capital, along with neighboring Bogor and the <br />Banten area, once formed part of Tarumanagara (1), the oldest <br />Kingdom in Java. <br /><br />Jakarta was the site of the most important ancient monument, the <br />Tugu, one of seven stone monuments dating back to the Kingdom. <br /><br />Tarumanagara existed between the fifth century and the seventh <br />century. The area where the substantial monument was found was <br />a village of Batu Tumbuh in present-day Tugu subdistrict in North <br />Jakarta. <br /><br />Besides praising the revered Tarumanagara King Purnawarman, the opal-<br />shaped Tugu boulder told of the digging of a water channel, called <br />Gomati, near the place where the monument was found. <br /><br />The stone also described another water channel, Candrabhaga (2), <br />also built during the era of the kingdom. It is believed the two <br />channels were near the present Cakung River in the Tugu area. <br /><br />The story, which was written in the South Indian Pallava script of <br />the Sanskrit language (3), said the digging of the 11-kilometer <br />Gomati "river" which passed through the Brahman priests' lodgings <br />was completed within 21 days and the priests were rewarded with <br />1,000 cattle. <br /><br />The boulder does not tell the purpose of the project, but experts <br />surmise it was to cope with flooding or an irrigation system for <br />crops. <br /><br />Experts say the historical evidence makes it unsurprising that <br />modern-day Jakarta is drenched by devastating floods during the <br />annual rainy season. <br /><br />The evidence is slim, but archeologist Hasan Djafar from the <br />University of Indonesia said the two ideas about the use of the <br />channels seemed the most reasonable. <br /><br />"The surface of Jakarta's land is one meter to two meters lower than <br />the sea level, compared to centuries ago when some areas were equal <br />to the level. So, it's reasonable to assume that flooding also <br />occurred in the fifth century like this year." <br /><br />He speculated that residents were also involved in farming during <br />the kingdom era. <br /><br />"Hulls of rice used as a mixture for bricks of ancient temples were <br />found at the archeological sites of Cibuaya and Batujaya villages in <br />Bogor (West Java)," he said. <br /><br />"It indicates that hulls of rice were abundant, meaning that paddy <br />fields existed at that time." <br /><br />Historian Adolf Heuken questioned whether the original construction <br />was a river. <br /><br />"It's so surprising that an 11-kilometer river could be built within <br />only 21 days, or it is just a ditch?" he said in his book Sumber- <br />sumber Asli Sejarah Jakarta (The Original Sources of Jakarta <br />History). <br /><br />But the king's prize of 1,000 cattle indicated that the project was <br />a great achievement, he said. <br /><br />Heuken said the project showed that people at the time had the <br />capability of digging long water channels, and were also able to <br />breed livestock. <br /><br />Besides the Pallava scripts, a picture of a priest's trident rod was <br />also carved in the monument, functioning to separate the beginning <br />and the end of lines, Heuken said. <br /><br />"It could be that the rod has symbolic or magical meaning," he said. <br /><br />The stone was found in 1879 at Batu Tumbuh, which literally <br />means "emerging stone". <br /><br />"It is said that the stone appeared suddenly after a monthlong <br />period of rain. I think the monument appeared after the soil was <br />eroded by rain," said a resident of the Tugu area, Samuel Quico. <br /><br />Hasan said Tugu subdistrict, and thus the present Jakarta area, was <br />only part of the Kingdom, which spanned over much of present day <br />Jakarta -- ranging from Banten in the west, Karawang in the east and <br />Sukabumi in the south. <br /><br />Experts are still searching for the kingdom's capital as no <br />archeological proof has been uncovered. Many believe it was at the <br />Tugu area but others consider the likely site in Bekasi (4), about <br />40 kilometers east of Jakarta. <br /><br />It is also notable that the seven monuments dating back to the third <br />century only mention one king, Purnawarman (5). <br /><br />Four other monuments at Bogor's Ciaruteun, Kebon Kopi and Jambu, and <br />Cidanghiang in the Pandeglang area about 120 kilometers southwest of <br />Jakarta, also praise Purnawarman as a great and powerful king. <br /><br />Images on two other stones, the Muara Cianten and Pasir Awi <br />monuments of Bogor, remain indecipherable up to the present. <br /><br />The eight-ton Ciaruteun stone was named after the river where it was <br />found in 1863. It is now well protected by the Bogor administration, <br />which built a structure to protect the stone from the elements. <br /><br />It is not easy to reach remote Kampung Muara village -- visitors <br />must use a muddy, unpaved road, and pass along a wooden bridge with <br />some of its slats missing. <br /><br />The four lines written in Pallava tell of two footprints carved in <br />it, and note their similarity to those of the Hindu god <br />Vishnu, "These are the footprints of His Majesty Purnawarman, the <br />brave king," the inscription reads. <br /><br />Unfortunately, inscriptions bearing no relation to history -- such <br />as "Ina, I love you" -- have been written on the stone. <br /><br />Located nearby is the Kebon Kopi stone with the engraving of a <br />couple of big footprints of Purnawarman, akin to those of the strong <br />Airwata elephant. <br /><br />Footprints and more praise of Purnawarman are also at the Jambu <br />monument. The Cidanghiang stone bears only two lines of inscription <br />about Purnawarman, who is proclaimed the standard for rulers around <br />the world. <br /><br />Hasan said the footprints found at almost of the monuments have been <br />interpreted by some as a seal, while others believed they were a <br />fertility symbol. <br /><br />He said Purnawarman's identification with Vishnu showed that the <br />king was Hindu. <br /><br />"Based on reports from China, written by traveler Fa Hsien, it was <br />known that the Tarumanagara people followed Hindu and Buddhist <br />teachings. But he also found some professed 'dirty' religion, <br />probably referring to prehistoric beliefs." <br /><br />Another interesting aspect is that the scripts were written in <br />Pallava/Sanskrit, proving that Tarumanagara was exposed to <br />foreign cultures. <br /><br />It is unclear what language was used by the local population, of <br />Mongoloid and Australoid-Melanoid extraction. <br /><br />"The local language is probably what developed into the Sundanese <br />or Javanese languages," Hasan said. <br /><br />Research has failed to reveal exactly when Tarumanagara came to <br />an end. <br /><br />"At present it is believed that the kingdom finally related to the <br />expansion of the Buddhist Sriwijaya kingdom from Sumatra, as <br />dates back to year 686 and says that Sriwijaya did its utmost to <br />shown by Kota Kapur monument of Bangka island," Hasan said. "It <br />subjugate Java which did not bow to Sriwijaya." <br /><br />From: <br />The Jakarta Post</div>

			<div class="content">Think I stirred the hornet's nest here.<br />1. There is a mention of a Tamil-brahmi inscription in<br />mamandur which is deciphered by Iravatham Mahadeven<br />and dated as the later part of the 2nd century AD. As<br />per the timelines, Pallavas does not appear on the<br />horizon till the middle of the third century AD and<br />they start using the Tamil-Brahmi right away. Meaning,<br />the script is already available for usage. But it<br />would be interesting to see the kind of changes they<br />introduced. But as per my readings, tamil-brahmi is<br />what is referred as pallava scripts by the south<br />eastern historians. I am open to change my view if<br />there is evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />2.My contention is that the merchantile contact with<br />the south east asia is what is responsible for the<br />introduction of the script in these areas and Pallavas<br />has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />3. The only known military raid(atleast to me) is by<br />Rajendra I and by one of his successors which resulted<br />in more contacts with SE Asia and more intermingling<br />between the Indian settlers and the natives. This<br />resulted in the formation of communities with mixed<br />Hindu/Buddhist heritage and influenced heavily by<br />Indic culture.<br /><br />4. There were Hindu kings who ruled in SE Asia and<br />this is the reason for the fantastic temples still<br />found as ruins. And the reason for a lot of hindu epic<br />reliefs in buddhist temples like borobadur, Angor<br />Wat(which was converted to a buddhist temple) etc.<br /><br />Back to John Keay, he calls the 'wars' of Rajaraja and<br />Rajendra as raids for plunder and cites an inscription<br />by the Chalukyas lamenting the loss of wealth due to<br />the plunder of Chola forces. Also cites from the<br />sources in Sri Lanka about Rajaraja's plunder of<br />Anurathapura and equates it with raids by, hold your<br />breath, Mohamed of Ghazni. I know, I know I am going<br />to take a lot of flak for this, but barring the<br />comparison, I tend to think that war is ugly and there<br />is always the possibility that plunder was a necessity<br />to bring other people to submission.<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />"'I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, Sir,' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself you see.'"<br />-Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div>

The way the script worked remained unchanged. <br />  <br />  <br />  i have also uploading two files &#40; sourced from various sources on <br />  the net ofcourse&#41; which trace the evolution of most SEA scripts <br />from <br />  pallava prototype which again evolved from brahmi<br />  <br />  would leave the rest to the learned scholars to comment upon.<br />  <br />  rgds<br />  vj<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Venkateswaran K <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    Is there any evidence of usage of pallava script<br />    during 2nd cent.

Not just a history but an<br />      actual<br />      analysis of the artifacts and the inscriptions<br />      through<br />      which the history is derived, peppered with very<br />      interesting anecdotes of the various archeologists<br />      and<br />      linguists who have helped unravel the history of<br />      India. Currently I am reading the history of India<br />      around 300AD and I find it interesting to note that<br />      he<br />      has written extensively on the cultural influence of<br />      India in the south east Asian countries. He uses the<br />      evidences of the travellers and the actual<br />      settlements<br />      in Malay peninsula and the Mekong valley area. He<br />      uses<br />      references from Chinese resources which mention the<br />      Indian settlements in these areas during the first<br />      centuries after Christ. Infact the Funan dynasty in<br />      the Khmer region &#40;includes Vietnam and Cambodia&#41; is<br />      said to have been founded by a Indian Brahmin named<br />      Kaudiniya and his Khmer queen Naga Soma in the first<br />      century AD. There have been reports of the<br />      missionaries sent by Asoka who were the first<br />      bearers<br />      of Indian civilization in these areas. Keay also<br />      mentions of an island named Mathura in Indonesia<br />      which<br />      clearly is inspired by the Indian city names of<br />      Mathura/Madurai. There were merchant communities<br />      that<br />      operated in these areas from the Greaco-Roman times<br />      and there is proof in the form of the Roman coins<br />      found and the inscriptions found in these areas &#40;in<br />      Pallava scripts, which are nothing but<br />      Tamil-Brahmi&#41;.<br />      What Keay argues is that Indians never ruled these<br />      areas but were mainly traders and there may have<br />      been<br />      raids by Indian kings in these areas to protect the<br />      trade interests&#40;from Pallavas to Cholas&#41;. But these<br />      areas were Indianized to a higher level due to<br />      influence of the Hindu epics and the presence of the<br />      trading community which usually settled down and<br />      never<br />      thought of going back home. <br />      Thus I think it is very doubtful that the Pallavas<br />      built anything on Java/Sumatra and the article cited<br />      has very thin evidence as to that fact. Infact I see<br />      an article on a local Hindu king using the pallava<br />      scripts and I am not sure how that authenticates<br />      that<br />      the Pallavas built anything on these islands. If<br />      there<br />      is a inscription in Pallava script naming Mahendra<br />      varman, that is iron-clad evidence of this fact not<br />      just the usage of Pallava script&#40;which was used from<br />      the second century AD much before pallavas&#41;.<br />      <br />      Muthu Prakash R<br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />      <br />      <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --> <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />      <br />      "&#39;I can&#39;t explain myself, I&#39;m afraid, Sir,&#39; said<br />      Alice, &#39;because I&#39;m not myself you see.&#39;" <br />      -Alice in Alice In Wonderland<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />     <br />    <br />  <br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />  _______________<br />    Never miss an email again!<br />    Yahoo!

"    =================================  SPS wrote earlier :  I have been reading extensively on Rajendra Chozha.  Summarising : He was called Rajendra Chozha devar in the 4th yr  inscription of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> (989 AD). Means he should havebeen grown up by  then.    Rajendra was the c-in-c for Kanthalurchalai conquest :: 988 AD.  Means he was all along in the limelight for about 25 years till <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>  installed him in Chozha throne in 1012, after Big temple consecration  in  1010 and then he had an excellent innings - in the North and Overseas.    Rajendra accomplished two things which his father desired :  (1) brought India mudi and Sundara haaram from Rohana hills, Lanka;  (2) Conquering Manyakedam @ Gulbargha :: <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> vowed not to take part in  Jalakkreedai till he conquored Manyakedam!    Rajendra conquored not only Then-Madurai (Pandyas) but also Vada  Madurai (Madura of Lord Krishna!) - confirms his Meykeerthi. He was a  good friend of Bojarajan of Ujjain (Vikramaditha famous), along with  whom he fought against Md Gazni. Fearing the might of  Rajendra, Gazni left for Somnathpur and ransacked there.    His ganges expeditionwas not a mere pilgrimage. His commanders  overstayed  and ruled certain parts of North! (as pointed by his name-sake!)    <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> consolidated Chozha holdings. But Rajendra expanded them beyond the  dreams of any Tamil Kings.   Marghazhi Thiruvadhirai is his birth star. Annabishekam at Gangai  Konda  Chozhapuram on that day - ARUDRA DARSANAM - is very famous even today.    Another interesting thing : In <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s period, his Queen Olgamadevigifted  a  Aadalvallan (Nataraja) to Big Temple with 9 Sadais and Ganges in it.  Present one in Big temple is having 10 sadais. Original piece is not  there. Apart from this, there are very few Natarajas which had Ganges  in the sadai till <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s period.    After Rajendra's Ganges expedition only, it has become aMUST and  praactice to include Ganges in the Nataraja's sadai.  ======================I know, I know I am going  to take a lot of flak for this, but barring the  comparison, I tend to think that war is ugly and there  is always the possibility that plunder was a necessity  to bring other people to submission.
