			<div class="content">Hi<br />i for one have come from one of the most casteist areas of tamil nadu.<br />a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news every year for the <br />high tensions prevailing during the ther function. the government has <br />cancelled the ther rather than shed blood sometimes.<br /><br />the swarna murthy temple is owned by the sivaganga queen, was rebuilt <br />and embellished with sculpture by the nagarathars.<br />but the fight is between the thevar cast and the dalits.<br /><br />where did the bramhin come into this?<br />the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the picture.<br /><br />this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the bramhin community of <br />creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945 was not the <br />bramhin if you take village wise.<br />the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars and the vandayars <br />in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the reddiars in mid <br />tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the thevars in the <br />south etc....<br />they controlled the village temple, they ran the local school and <br />generally decided who had to do what. if you observe without bias <br />these caste configurations still prevail in these areas.<br />the aim of the 'justice party' was to target braminism not in village <br />level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />a huge bramhin migration to the city , their aptitude for learning <br />caused a huge power shift in favour of them in british india. the <br />justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled them towards <br />greener pastures.<br /><br />like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer. my family was <br />closely involved in the justice party in the early years.<br /><br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash <br />R"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Sathish<br />  <br />  Having some familiarity with the tamil movement in the last 150 <br />  years and read through a few of the books, here are my comments.<br />  <br />  1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south Tamilnadu as a <br />  antidote to the active missionary activities in these areas. Refer <br />  Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a movement fostered <br />  primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with the Athinams of <br />  these areas to counter the conversion activities and promote <br />Saivism <br />  as an active alternative.<br />  2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the Saivism is based on <br />  the fact that it lead to the contact with &#39;low&#39; castes and the <br />  language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the &#39;exclusivity&#39; of <br />  sanskrit.<br />  3. This happens about 150 years back and if you look into the <br />  history of the ascendent &#39;low&#39; castes/high castes of these times <br />  &#40;like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc&#41;, they ended up building <br />  temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests and the pooja was <br />  done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my Kuladeivam temple is <br />  in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on my talks with the <br />  poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for atleast 3-4 <br />  generations. This is also recorded in the Hardgrave&#39;s history on <br />  Nadars and Caldwell&#39;s history on Thirunelveli &#40;both are available <br />  and in print&#41;. This is true in any number of temples built by the <br />  low/high castes for the siru as well as perunthivangal. <br />  4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the society in terms of <br />  prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating the Brahmins who <br />  were already there as the highest caste. When that was found to not <br />  yield results, they sort of &#39;rebelled&#39; and asserted themselves by <br />  building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />  5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most of you here for <br />  the kind of reaction espoused by DK &#40;the Justice party before that&#41; <br />  is actually surprising. To understand the kind of oppression that <br />  went through in the rural areas of southern TN in the late last <br />  century, you need to read the histories mentioned above along with <br />  the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references to it in <br />  U.Ve.Sa&#39;s &#39;En sarithiram&#39;, the journals of the Saveriraya pillai <br />  &#40;who converted to Christianity&#41; etc. It is no use just expressing <br />  outrage at Periyar without understanding the context. <br />  Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of avoiding the <br />  Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the DK. If you look <br />  into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he comes from a <br />very <br />  religious background with a lot of compassion for the downtrodden. <br />  Only when he realized that it is not possible to change the system <br />  from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to break up the <br />entire <br />  system and built it anew. There his opposition for Ramayan and <br />other <br />  established scriptures which need to be tossed aside and a new <br />  society to be built. We know what happened to that now.<br />  <br />  The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a Tamil, for better or <br />  worse and it is not a &#39;religious fundamentalist&#39; movement but a <br />  nationalist movement trying to free the masses from years of <br />  oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the people together <br />  and build a new society. How much good/bad came out of it is <br />  debatable. <br />  <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogpost.com">http://sibipranav.blogpost.com</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - As an aside my father spent a day in the police station during <br />  the 1964 agitations for taking part in a anti-hindi rally in <br />  Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly forbidden him to <br />  do any such things again. There ended my family&#39;s association with <br />  this movement. <br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Since I could not lay my hands on any of the information <br />  pertaining to<br />    the basis of Jan 14 being tamil new year &#40;again i should admit I <br />  might<br />    not be doing a good search&#41;, I started searching for Maraimalai<br />    adigal, since he was one of the key person in the 1921 convention.<br />    <br />    Not much I could get, but came across an interesting book by <br />  Sumathi<br />    ramaswamy, titled &#39;Passion of the Tongue - Language Devotion in <br />  Tamil<br />    India, 1891Â–1970&#39; published in the year 1997. This book is <br />  available<br />    in the link below -<br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol">http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId ... and=eschol</a><!-- m --><br />    <br />    I didnt go through the entire book, but a quick scan on a few <br />  pages, i<br />    got something. I should admit, my understanding could be totally <br />  wrong<br />    or I would have missed the context. Scholars in this group can <br />  correct me.<br />    <br />    - The need for Tamil Passion came as an offshoot of religious<br />    fundamentalism. If I understand right, anti-brahminism<br />    - Indian National Congress was full of active brahmins and the<br />    non-brahmin community feared this prosperity of brahmins.<br />    - To alienate the brahmins or the aryan influence, a need was <br />felt <br />  to<br />    come out with a Tamil based culture - glorifying Tamil, calling <br />  tamil<br />    as &#39;Taniththamizh&#39; &#40;without mix of Sanskrit&#41;, &#39;theivath thamizh&#39;<br />    taking the language to godliness.<br />    - This continued to the movement to clear tamil of other langauge <br />  mix,<br />    like english, sanskrit and persian &#40;?&#41; and make the tamil language<br />    pure. Thats when pure tamil movement was started<br />    - Many stalwarts including Maraimalai adigal were part of this<br />    movement. they were not atheist but said that siva is a tamil god <br />  and<br />    not a aryan god. This gave raise to the Saiva sidhantham. later<br />    Periya, Anna et al are said to have adopted this thani tamil<br />    ideology.This gave raise to the draidian movement. &#40;but I am not <br />  sure<br />    how the atheism came in&#41;<br />    <br />    Good to know that Maraimalai adigal has published nearly 54 books,<br />    both in english and tamil.<br />    <br />    Someon said that only mylapore ,mambalam people accepted aryan <br />  theory<br />    and this book says that the non-brahmins of tamil nadu wanted to<br />    alienate brahmins who are aryans. I am totally confused <img src="/images/smilies/frown.gif" alt=":&#40;" title="Sad" /> manda<br />    kayuthu...<br />    <br />    The best part is - The tamil purist said tamil has a religion of <br />  their<br />    own and a person is considered a &#39;Tamilan&#39; only if his uyir porul <br />  aavi<br />    is tamil. They also add that people who came from outside with <br />  tamil<br />    not as their mother tongue, and still love tamil, they are also<br />    tamilan. Whoever wishes to learn and love tamil is also &#39;tamilan&#39;.<br />    <br />    BUT....tamil brahmins are not tamilan!!!!!!!!<br />    <br />    yaravathu indha book-a fulla padichi enakku theliva <br />  sollungalen......<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Satish<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    -</div></blockquote></div>

It makes me very hesitant to share views<br />  on similar subjects any more.<br />  ==============================<br />  <br />  I am sure you have acknowledged the sensitivity of the subject <br />  already ..<br />  <br />  <br />  There are ample fresh things to discuss, share and cherish..<br />  <br />  Let us look forward ..<br />  <br />  NOW IN GENERAL I AM ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT : <br />  <br />  Indira Vizha - Chithra Pournami + Rohini combination ... the <br />  romantic idea of the Tamils more than 2000 years, posted in my <br />  earlier mail ... has gone un-noticed .... !<br />  <br />  regards / sps<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  If they read the books to<br />    understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />    positive, or could not tell public what was true about<br />    Ramayana and what was not? I have known westerners,<br />    completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana and<br />    were very impressed by qualities they found. They did<br />    find issues too but not like the mindset the DKites<br />    had.<br />    <br />    I realize you want to close the thread, as this is not<br />    going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am just<br />    disappointed that you chose to see one member&#39;s stance<br />    only and conclude based on that.<br />    <br />    Noone is disputing the need for anti religious, anti<br />    caste struggle that started with EVR&#39;s leadership. But<br />    to continue the line of hate propoganda and label all<br />    believers as &#39;kattu mirandis&#39; and &#39;mutttaals&#39; is<br />    outdated and uncivilised. To do away with &#39;give and<br />    take respect&#39; is even more uncivilised. I have<br />    attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />    also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />    most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />    something alternate, just calling &#39;kadavul illai&#39; is<br />    not what one believes in. Second in western countries<br />    you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />    other person &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattumirandi&#39;. If you think<br />    they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate that<br />    and attack the abuse, not the belief system.<br />    <br />    Malathi<br />    --- Sivapathasekaran  wrote: <br />    <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi<br />      Mahadevan <br />       wrote: <br />        <br />        SPS I would correct what you said a little, one<br />      should<br />        read and understand more not just on Periyar, Anna<br />      and<br />        Kalignar, but on *anyone* we choose to comment or<br />        develop strong feelings around.

			<div class="content">Ravi,<br />You mention " if DK was not there, the rampant practices of casteisum would<br />have<br />deteriorated the country". Having lived outside Tamil Nadu for the majority<br />of my life<br />I can say with some degree of confidence that TN is probably one of the most<br />casteist<br />states along with Bihar and UP.

To do away with &#39;give and<br />  take respect&#39; is even more uncivilised. I have<br />  attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />  also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />  most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />  something alternate, just calling &#39;kadavul illai&#39; is<br />  not what one believes in. Second in western countries<br />  you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />  other person &#39;muttal&#39; and &#39;kattumirandi&#39;. If you think<br />  they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate that<br />  and attack the abuse, not the belief system.<br />  <br />  I am stopping here, and again am very disappointed<br />  that a balance is not brought to this debate before<br />  conclusion. It makes me very hesitant to share views<br />  on similar subjects any more.<br />  <br />  Malathi<br /><br />  --- Sivapathasekaran  wrote: <br />  <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --> , Malathi<br />    Mahadevan <br />     wrote: <br />      <br />      SPS I would correct what you said a little, one<br />    should<br />      read and understand more not just on Periyar, Anna<br />    and<br />      Kalignar, but on *anyone* we choose to comment or<br />      develop strong feelings around.
