The object of the attack<br />was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial<br />monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after<br />settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.<br /><br />Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second<br />time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east<br />recognised his power and sought his friendship.<br /><br />After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His<br />major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya Bahu<br />was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra sent<br />a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The Cholas<br />won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities.<br />Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost<br />territories.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Try the all-new Yahoo!
