The king, a <br />devout<br />  saivite, wanted all the vaishnavas to accept that Siva was above<br />  Narayana and say it loudly. One of his ministers, a vaishnavite, to<br />  avoid the harassement to simple folks, told the king to make <br />Ramanuja<br />  accept Siva&#39;s supremacy, as he was their most visible and prominent<br />  guru.

			<div class="content">Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK. Actually according <br />to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the stories of <br />all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni until <br />Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the Chola King to <br />recite Siva's name as supreme. <br /><br />The story goes thus: (As taken from the book "Guruparampara Prabhavam")<br /><br />..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri for his <br />bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and informed that <br />the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about the <br />Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the foremost <br />disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of the <br />meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya and hence he <br />silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with Periya <br />Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the Chola King in <br />the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples of <br />Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked them to <br />prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though Ramanuja did <br />not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that Koorathazhwan has <br />already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure by his <br />other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of his Acharya <br />(Periya Nambi) and his Sishya (Koorathazhwan), left for Melkote in <br />present day Karnataka.<br /><br />Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However, there was a <br />minister by name "Naalooran" in King's court, who was once supposed to <br />have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified him <br />(traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery to utmost <br />concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to be <br />deciphered) as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained Koorathazhwan to <br />write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The wording that <br />Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam nAsthi". <br />Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course Koorathazhwan did <br />write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha param". <br />Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than 'sivam". In older days the <br />words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam was larger <br />in measurement than sivam. <br /><br />On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked the eyes <br />of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi. However <br />Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my eyes. I will <br />do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and plucks it <br />himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain. <br /><br />This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-up in the <br />screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true. However we <br />cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for ourselves. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Humble Groups" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I just saw Kalaignar&#39;s note about the first scene.

			<div class="content">Mr Dinakaran,<br /><br />Let me answer your questions.<br /><br />1. Regarding the Tatoo: <br />Yes I saw that too. It is correct. The Srivaishnavites will bear the <br />marks of Sangu on their Left Shoulder and Chakra on their Right <br />shoulder. This signifies that, person has completely surrendered to <br />Vishnu and has accepted Him as his Sole-Saviour. <br /><br />To reflect a little on this, this act of getting the Sangu-Chakram <br />marks embossed is called "samAsrayaNam". The equivalent of this is <br />the "thAli" that the women wears from their husband. Here the husband <br />is supposed to be the Sole Saviour of the women and she is supposed <br />to only rely on her husband for everything. Philosophically, in <br />Srivaishnavism, it is considered that all jeevAthmAs are female in <br />Nature and the only Male is the Supreme Being, which in this case is <br />Vishnu. So when one gets the "samAshrayaNam" done, he is supposed to <br />be faithful only to Vishnu and not to anyone else.<br /><br />This is why you see that staunch Srivaishnavites do not go to any <br />Siva temple. Rest assured it is not fanaticism, but utmost loyalty to <br />Vishnu considered as their husband. Like any chaste woman would treat <br />any other men (other than her husband) with respect, but will never <br />look forward to them for anything, the Srivaishnavites as a practice, <br />go and pray only at the Vishnu Temples, though inherently the respect <br />is there for all gods, be it Siva or Muruga or Ganapathi.<br /><br />2. Beard and Moustache: <br /><br />Together, both are allowed but none in isolation. I honestly do not <br />know what is the significance of this. But that is the practice that <br />I know. I cant have a moustache alone. However if one grows them <br />together, it is okay. Probably some Brahminical Ritualistic <br />significance! Any other learned member can throw some light on this.<br /><br />However the buzz is that Kamal had contact some Vaishnavite scholars <br />in Triplicane and other places. So if he still has taken such a scene <br />like King asking Ramanuja instead of Koorathazhwan to recite the <br />verses, it is nothing but a GLOBAL SCREW-UP!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Rahul dhinakaran" <br /> wrote: <br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Mr.Venkatesh;<br />  That is a truly wonderful account of whats written in the <br />Prabhavam.

Knowing well about the<br />    Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the <br />foremost<br />    disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of the<br />    meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya and <br />hence he<br />    silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with <br />Periya<br />    Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the Chola <br />King in<br />    the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples of<br />    Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked them <br />to<br />    prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though Ramanuja <br />did<br />    not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that Koorathazhwan <br />has<br />    already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure by <br />his<br />    other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of his <br />Acharya<br />    &#40;Periya Nambi&#41; and his Sishya &#40;Koorathazhwan&#41;, left for Melkote in<br />    present day Karnataka.<br />   <br />    Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However, there <br />was a<br />    minister by name "Naalooran" in King&#39;s court, who was once <br />supposed to<br />    have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified him<br />    &#40;traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery to <br />utmost<br />    concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to be<br />    deciphered&#41; as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained <br />Koorathazhwan to<br />    write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The <br />wording that<br />    Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam nAsthi".<br />    Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course Koorathazhwan <br />did<br />    write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha <br />param".<br />    Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than &#39;sivam". In older days <br />the<br />    words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam was <br />larger<br />    in measurement than sivam.<br />   <br />    On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked the <br />eyes<br />    of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi. <br />However<br />    Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my eyes. I <br />will<br />    do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and <br />plucks it<br />    himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.<br />   <br />    This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-up in <br />the<br />    screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true.

			<div class="content">Mr Venketesh<br /><br />The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial debate going on <br />between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The thenkalais claim that <br />vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only after Ramanuja, but <br />only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in the Guruparampara. <br />The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated from Pillai <br />Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br /><br />This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the <br />other's views. Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters into a <br />philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup <br />regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on that <br />debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it is <br />subject to a debate.<br /><br />Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. He <br />attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines <br />which all the historians accept unopposed.<br /><br />Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the <br />Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though <br />within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that <br />Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and got <br />it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was <br />reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere (may be in <br />this group itself) that He was reinstated during the times of Nayak <br />kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.<br /><br />Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as <br />Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of <br />Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the <br />history. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br />  so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />  <br />  i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41; instruments used on ramanuja <br />  himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were discovered in a <br />  secret chamber in the last decade<br />  <br />  .
