			<div class="content">MESSAGE NO 201 FROM ARCHIVES REPOSTED:<br /><br />Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> as<br />compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -<br /><br />* Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards<br />this event and the author would have supported one side - portraying<br />the other as the evil force. Kalki's own <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is no exception to this.<br /><br />But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will<br />be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />(refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is the<br />murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why when<br />you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too at<br />the end of 5th volume !<br /><br />* Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero Â– but in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) becomes a<br />hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted Arulmozhi<br />to be recognized as a hero in his novel Â– the name Ponniyin<br />selvan is<br />derived from him Â– but an `all perfect' figure he<br />portrayed only<br />helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology of<br />events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi Â– who is a character in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />and<br />Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> Paranjothi character is used to<br />introduce many characters in the Novel Â– but the real hero is<br />Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar<br />technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own creator !<br /><br />* Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in<br />timeline (invariably). For example, in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> the last part happens after<br />a gap of 9 years. But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> portrays events continuously for a period of<br />6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out who<br />was doing what for almost every day Â– for a period of 6 months.<br /><br />* Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur Â– and yet Â–<br />with master<br />craftsmanship Â– will link them in a very logical order Â– as<br />pages<br />move byÂ…<br /><br />* Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />researched topic<br /><br />* This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds of<br />love between human beings portrayed Â–<br />- Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other since<br />their first sight.<br />- Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />Amudhan<br />- Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />vanathi<br />- Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi<br />- Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali<br />- Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />- Aditya's love towords Nandhini<br />- Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini<br />- Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini<br />- Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan<br /><br />Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, two<br />sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do Â– given the<br />wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays<br /><br /><br />* <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> has different heros at<br />different points of timeÂ…<br />- In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />- In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />- In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />- Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he becomes<br />royal heir etc)<br />- During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />Thus it is close to real life in which different people become heros<br />at different points of time.<br /><br />* Surprise ! <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> seems to have no villains ! (or rather everybody seem<br />to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a villi but<br />after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ? Remember<br />Â–<br />they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect their<br />leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />cruelty of Pandiya's murder Â– this can be understood.<br />In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with possible<br />realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.<br /><br />I initially though of writing a small mail Â– but this is close to<br />becoming an article. I can write many things like thisÂ….and yet<br />may<br />not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />historic novel ever written.<br /><br />Your comments are welcome.<br />Cheers !<br />Gokul.</div>

The entire novel will be moving towards<br />      this event and the author would have supported one side -<br />    portraying<br />      the other as the evil force. Kalki&#39;s own <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> is no exception to<br />    this.<br />     <br />      But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is different in this respect - to a careful observer it<br />will<br />      be evident that the novel does&#39;nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />      felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />      &#40;refer his conclusion to the novel&#41; - to many readers it is the<br />      murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why<br />    when<br />      you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />      dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too<br />    at<br />      the end of 5th volume !<br />     <br />      * Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero Â– but<br />in<br />      <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />      a small, insignificant and noble warrior &#40;Vandhiyathevan&#41; becomes<br />a<br />      hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted<br />    Arulmozhi<br />      to be recognized as a hero in his novel Â– the name Ponniyin<br />      selvan is<br />      derived from him Â– but an `all perfect&#39; figure he<br />      portrayed only<br />      helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology<br />    of<br />      events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />      compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi Â– who is a character in<br /><acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />      and<br />      Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> Paranjothi character is used to<br />      introduce many characters in the Novel Â– but the real hero is<br />      Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a<br />similar<br />      technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own<br />    creator !<br />     <br />      * Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks<br />in<br />      timeline &#40;invariably&#41;. For example, in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> the last part happens<br />    after<br />      a gap of 9 years. But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> portrays events continuously for a period<br />    of<br />      6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out<br />    who<br />      was doing what for almost every day Â– for a period of 6<br />months.<br />     <br />      * Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />      places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />      time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />      Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur Â– and yet Â–<br />      with master<br />      craftsmanship Â– will link them in a very logical order Â–<br />as<br />      pages<br />      move byÂ…<br />     <br />      * Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />      researched topic<br />     <br />      * This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds<br />    of<br />      love between human beings portrayed Â–<br />      - Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other<br />    since<br />      their first sight.<br />      - Poonguzhali&#39;s love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />      Amudhan<br />      - Arulmozhi&#39;s interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />      vanathi<br />      - Vanathi&#39;s love towords Arulmizhi<br />      - Amudhan&#39;s love towords Poonguzhali<br />      - Nandhini&#39;s love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />      - Aditya&#39;s love towords Nandhini<br />      - Parthibendhran&#39;s love towords Nandhini<br />      - Pazhuvettaraiyar&#39;s interest in Nandhini<br />      - Manimekalai&#39;s love towords Vandhiyathevan<br />     <br />      Initially I thought of categorizing them &#40;like one sided love, two<br />      sided love etc&#41; but I find that it is difficult to do Â– given<br />the<br />      wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays<br />     <br />     <br />      * <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />      dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> has different heros at<br />      different points of timeÂ…<br />      - In Pallipadai events &#40;Part I&#41; Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />      - In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />      Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />      - In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />      - Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />      Part IV and V &#40;During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he<br />    becomes<br />      royal heir etc&#41;<br />      - During the aftermath of floods &#40;Part IV&#41;, Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />      certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />      Thus it is close to real life in which different people become<br />    heros<br />      at different points of time.<br />     <br />      * Surprise ! <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> seems to have no villains ! &#40;or rather everybody<br />    seem<br />      to have enough justifications&#41; Nandhini might sound like a villi<br />    but<br />      after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />      reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ?<br />    Remember<br />      Â–<br />      they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect<br />    their<br />      leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />      undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />      cruelty of Pandiya&#39;s murder Â– this can be understood.<br />      In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with<br />    possible<br />      realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.<br />     <br />      I initially though of writing a small mail Â– but this is close<br />to<br />      becoming an article. I can write many things like thisÂ….and<br />yet<br />      may<br />      not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />      historic novel ever written.<br />     <br />      Your comments are welcome.<br />      Cheers !<br />      Gokul.</div></blockquote></div>

Considering <br />the<br />        cruelty of Pandiya&#39;s murder Â– this can be understood.<br />        In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with<br />      possible<br />        realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.<br />       <br />        I initially though of writing a small mail Â– but this is close<br />  to<br />        becoming an article. I can write many things like thisÂ….and<br />  yet<br />        may<br />        not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this <br />greatest<br />        historic novel ever written.<br />       <br />        Your comments are welcome.<br />        Cheers !<br />        Gokul.</div></blockquote></div>
