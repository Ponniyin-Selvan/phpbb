			<div class="content">Vedic Roots of Early Tamil Culture<br /><br /> <br />Summarized versions of this paper were presented at the Naimisha <br />Vedic Workshop, "Looking beyond the Aryan Invasion," organized by <br />Naimisha Foundation at Bangalore on March 12-13, 2001, and at the <br />National Seminar on Origins of United Vedic Culture organized by <br />Pragna Bharati and sponsored by the Indian Council of Historical <br />Research at Hyderabad on March 17-18, 2001. [*] <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In recent years attempts have been made to cast a new look at ancient <br />India. For too long the picture has been distorted by myopic colonial <br />readings of India's prehistory and early history, and more recently <br />by ill-suited Marxist models. One such distortion was the Aryan <br />invasion theory, now definitively on its way out, although its <br />watered-down avatars are still struggling to survive. It will no <br />doubt take some more timeÂ—and much more effort on the archaeological <br />frontÂ—for a new perspective of the earliest civilization in the North <br />of the subcontinent to take firm shape, but a beginning has been made.<br />We have a peculiar situation too as regards Southern India, and <br />particularly Tamil Nadu. Take any classic account of Indian history <br />and you will see how little space the South gets in comparison with <br />the North. While rightly complaining that "Hitherto most historians <br />of ancient India have written as if the south did not exist,"[ 1]<br />Vincent Smith in his Oxford History of India hardly devotes a few <br />pages to civilization in the South, that too with the usual <br />stereotypes to which I will return shortly. R. C. Majumdar's Advanced <br />History of India,[2] or A. L. Basham's The Wonder That Was India[3] <br />are hardly better in that respect. The first serious History of South <br />India,[4] that of K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, appeared only in 1947. Even <br />recent surveys of Indian archaeology generally give the South a <br />rather cursory treatment.<br />The Context<br />It is a fact that archaeology in the South has so far unearthed <br />little that can compare to findings in the North in terms of <br />ancientness, massiveness or sophistication : the emergence of urban <br />civilization in Tamil Nadu is now fixed at the second or third <br />century BC, about two and a half millennia after the appearance of <br />Indus cities. Moreover, we do not have any fully or largely excavated <br />city or even medium-sized town : Madurai, the ancient capital of the <br />Pandya kingdom, has hardly been explored at all ; Uraiyur, that of <br />the early Cholas, saw a dozen trenches ;[5] Kanchipuram, the <br />Pallavas' capital, had seventeen, and Karur, that of the Cheras, <br />hardly more ; Kaveripattinam,[6] part of the famous ancient city of <br />Puhar (the first setting of the Shilappadikaram epic), saw more <br />widespread excavations, yet limited with regard to the potential the <br />site offers. The same may be said of Arikamedu (just south of <br />Pondicherry), despite excavations by Jouveau-Dubreuil, Wheeler, and <br />several other teams right up to the 1990s.[7]<br />All in all, the archaeological record scarcely measures up to what <br />emerges from the Indo-Gangetic plainsÂ—which is one reason why <br />awareness of these excavations has hardly reached the general public, <br />even in Tamil Nadu ; it has heard more about the still superficial <br />exploration of submerged Poompuhar than about the painstaking work <br />done in recent decades at dozens of sites. (See a map of Tamil Nadu's <br />important archaeological sites below.)<br />But there is a second reason for this poor awareness : scholars and <br />politicians drawing inspiration from the Dravidian movement launched <br />by E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker ("Periyar") have very rigid ideas about <br />the ancient history of Tamil Nadu. First, despite all evidence to the <br />contrary, they still insist on the Aryan invasion theory in its most <br />violent version, turning most North Indians and upper-caste Indians <br />into descendants of the invading Aryans who overran the indigenous <br />Dravidians, and Sanskrit into a deadly rival of Tamil. Consequently, <br />they assert that Tamil is more ancient than Sanskrit, and <br />civilization in the South older than in the North. Thus recently, <br />Tamil Nadu's Education minister decried in the State Assembly those <br />who go "to the extent of saying that Dravidian civilization is part <br />of Hinduism" and declared, "The Dravidian civilization is older than <br />the Aryan."[8] It is not uncommon to hear even good Tamil scholars <br />utter such claims.<br />Now, it so happens that archaeological findings in Tamil Nadu, though <br />scanty, are nevertheless decisive. Indeed, we now have a broad <br />convergence between literary, epigraphic and archaeological evidence.<br />[9] Thus names of cities, kings and chieftains mentioned in Sangam <br />literature have often been confirmed by inscriptions and coins dating <br />back to the second and third centuries BC. Kautilya speaks in his <br />Arthashastra (c. fourth century BC) of the "easily travelled southern <br />land route," with diamonds, precious stones and pearls from the <br />Pandya country ;[10] two Ashokan rock edicts (II and XIII[11]) <br />respectfully refer to Chola, Pandya and Chera kingdoms <br />as "neighbours," therefore placing them firmly in the third century <br />BC ; we also have Kharavela's cave inscription near Bhubaneswar in <br />which the Kalinga king (c. 150 BC) boasts of having broken up <br />a "confederacy of the Dravida countries which had lasted for 113 <br />years."[12] From: all these, it appears that the earliest Tamil <br />kingdoms must have been established around the fourth century BC ; <br />again, archaeological findings date urban developments a century or <br />two later, but this small gap will likely be filled by more extensive <br />excavations. But there's the rub : beyond the fourth century BC and <br />back to 700 or 1000 BC, all we find is a megalithic period, and going <br />still further back, a neolithic period starting from about the third <br />millennium BC. While those two prehistoric periods are as important <br />as they are enigmatic, they show little sign of a complex culture,[*] <br />and no clear connection with the dawn of urban civilization in the <br />South.<br />Therefore the good minister's assertion as to the greater ancientness <br />of the "Dravidian civilization" finds no support on the ground. In <br />order to test his second assertion that that civilization is outside <br />Hinduism, or the common claim that so-called "Dravidian culture" is <br />wholly separate from so-called "Aryan" culture, let us take an <br />unbiased look at the cultural backdrop of early Tamil society and try <br />to make out some of its mainstays. That is what I propose to do <br />briefly, using not only literary evidence, but first, material <br />evidence from archaeological and numismatic sources as regards the <br />dawn of the Sangam age. I may add that I have left out the Buddhist <br />and Jain elements, already sufficiently well known, to concentrate on <br />the Vedic and Puranic ones, which are usually underemphasized. Also, <br />I will not deal here with the origin of South Indian people and <br />languages, or with the nature of the process often <br />called "Aryanization of the South" (I prefer the <br />word "Indianization," used in this context by an archaeologist[13]). <br />Those complex questions have been debated for decades, and will only <br />reach firm conclusions, I believe, with ampler archaeological <br />evidence.<br /><br /><br /><br />Map of some settlements of archelogical importance in Tamil Nadu<br /><br /><br /><br />Vedic & Puranic CultureÂ—Material Evidence<br />Culturally, the megalithic people of the South shared many beliefs <br />and practices with megalithic builders elsewhere in the subcontinent <br />and beyond. Yet certain practices and artefacts were at least <br />compatible with the Vedic world and may well have prepared for a <br />ready acceptance of Vedic conceptsÂ—a natural assimilative process <br />still observable in what has been called the "Hinduization" of <br />tribals. Thus several cists surrounded by stone-circles have four <br />vertical slabs arranged in the shape of a swastika.[14] The famous <br />3.5 metre-high figure of Mottur (in North Arcot district), carved out <br />of a granite slab, is "perhaps the first anthropomorphic <br />representation of a god in stone in Tamil Nadu."[15] Some megalithic <br />burials have yielded iron or bronze objects such as mother goddess, <br />horned masks, the trishul etc. As the archaeologist I. K. Sarma <br />observes, such objects are<br />intimately connected with the worship of brahmanical Gods of the <br />historical period, such as Siva, Kartikeya and later Amba. The <br />diadems of Adichanallur burials are like the mouth-pieces used by the <br />devotees of Murugan.[ 16]<br />The archaeologist K. V. Raman also notes :<br />Some form of Mother-Goddess worship was prevalent in the Megalithic <br />period ... as suggested by the discovery of a small copper image of a <br />Goddess in the urn-burials of Adichchanallur. More recently, in <br />Megalithic burials the headstone, shaped like the seated Mother, has <br />been located at two places in Tamil Nadu.[17]<br />Megalithic culture attached great importance to the cult of the dead <br />and ancestors, which parallels that in Vedic culture. It is also <br />likely that certain gods later absorbed into the Hindu pantheon, such <br />as Aiyanar (or Sastha), Murugan (the later Kartik), Korravai (Durga), <br />Naga deities, etc., were originally tribal gods of that period. <br />Though probably of later date, certain megalithic sites in the <br />Nilgiris were actually dolmen shrines, some of them holding Ganesh-<br />like images, others lingams.[ 18] Megalithic practices evocative of <br />later Hinduism are thus summarized by the British archaeologists <br />Bridget and Raymond Allchin :<br />The orientation of port-holes and entrances on the cist graves is <br />frequently towards the south. ... This demands comparison with later <br />Indian tradition where south is the quarter of Yama. Among the grave <br />goods, iron is almost universal, and the occasional iron spears and <br />tridents (trisulas) suggest an association with the god Siva. The <br />discovery in one grave of a trident with a wrought-iron buffalo fixed <br />to the shaft is likewise suggestive, for the buffalo is also <br />associated with Yama, and the buffalo demon was slain by the goddess <br />Durga, consort of Siva, with a trident. ... The picture which we <br />obtain from this evidence, slight as it is, is suggestive of some <br />form of worship of Siva.[ 19]<br />About the third century BC, cities and towns appear owing to yet <br />little understood factors ; exchanges with the Mauryan and Roman <br />empires seem to have played an important catalytic role, as also the <br />advent of iron. From: the very beginning, Buddhist, Jain and Hindu[*] <br />streaks are all clear.<br />Among the earliest evidences, a stratigraphic dig by I. K. Sarma <br />within the garbagriha of the Parasuramesvara temple at Gudimallam,[*] <br />brought to light the foundation of a remarkable Shivalingam of the <br />Mauryan period (possibly third century BC) : it was fixed within two <br />circular pithas at the centre of a square vastu-mandala. "The deity <br />on the frontal face of the tall linga reveals himself as a proto-<br />puranic Agni-Rudra"[20] standing on a kneeling devayana. If this <br />early date, which Sarma established on stratigraphic grounds and from <br />pottery sherds, is correct, this fearsome image could well be the <br />earliest such representation in the South.<br />Then we find "terracotta figures like Mother Goddess, Naga-linga <br />etc., from Tirukkampuliyur ; a seated Ganesa from Alagarai ; <br />Vriskshadevata and Mother Goddess from Kaveripakkam and Kanchipuram, <br />in almost certainly a pre-Pallava sequence."[21] Cult of a Mother <br />goddess is also noticed in the early levels at Uraiyur,[22] and at <br />Kaveripattinam, Kanchipuram and Arikamedu.[ 23] Excavations at <br />Kaveripattinam have brought to light many Buddhist artefacts, but <br />also, though of later date, a few figurines of Yakshas, of Garuda and <br />Ganesh.[24] Evidence of the Yaksha cult also comes from pottery <br />inscriptions at Arikamedu.[25]<br />The same site also yielded one square copper coin of the early <br />Cholas, depicting on the obverse an elephant, a ritual umbrella, the <br />Srivatsa symbol, and the front portion of a horse.[ 26] This is in <br />fact an important theme which recurs on many coins of the Sangam age<br />[27] recovered mostly from river beds near Karur, Madurai etc. <br />Besides the Srivatsa (also found among artefacts at Kanchipuram[28]), <br />many coins depict a swastika, a trishul, a conch, a shadarachakra, a <br />damaru, a crescent moon, and a sun with four, eight or twelve rays. <br />Quite a few coins clearly show a yagnakunda. That is mostly the case <br />with the Pandyas' coins, some of which also portray a yubastambha to <br />which a horse is tied as part of the ashvamedha sacrifice. As the <br />numismatist R. Krishnamurthy puts it, "The importance of Pandya coins <br />of Vedic sacrifice series lies in the fact that these coins <br />corroborate what we know from Sangam literature about the performance <br />of Vedic sacrifices by a Pandya king of this age."[29]<br />Finally, it is remarkable how a single coin often depicts symbols <br />normally associated with Lord Vishnu (the conch, the srivatsa, the <br />chakra) together with symbols normally associated with Lord Shiva <br />(the trishul, the crescent moon, the damaru).[30] Clearly, the <br />two "sects"Â—a very clumsy wordÂ—got along well enough. Interestingly, <br />other symbols depicted on these coins, such as the three- or six-<br />arched hill, the tree-in-railing, and the ritual stand in front of a <br />horse, are frequently found in Mauryan iconography.[31]<br />All in all, the material evidence, though still meagre, makes it <br />clear that Hindu concepts and cults were already integrated in the <br />society of the early historic period of Tamil Nadu side by side with <br />Buddhist and Jain elements. More excavations, for which there is <br />great scope, are certain to confirm this, especially if they <br />concentrate on ancient places of worship, as at Gudimallam. Let us <br />now see the picture we get from Sangam literature.<br />Vedic & Puranic CultureÂ—Literary Evidence<br />It is unfortunate that the most ancient Sangam compositions are <br />probably lost for ever ; we only know of them through brief <br />quotations in later works. An early text, the Tamil grammar <br />Tolkappiyam, dated by most scholars to the first or second century AD,<br />[*] is "said to have been modelled on the Sanskrit grammar of the <br />Aindra school."[32] Its content, says N. Raghunathan, shows that "the <br />great literature of Sanskrit and the work of its grammarians and <br />rhetoricians were well known and provided stimulus to creative <br />writers in Tamil.... The Tolkappiyam adopts the entire Rasa theory as <br />worked out in the Natya Sastra of Bharata."[33] It also refers to <br />rituals and customs coming from the "Aryans," a word which in Sangam <br />literature simply means North Indians of Vedic culture ; for <br />instance, the Tolkappiyam "states definitely that marriage as a <br />sacrament attended with ritual was established in the Tamil country <br />by the Aryas,"[ 34] and it uses the same eight forms of marriage <br />found in the Dharmashastras. Moreover, it mentions the caste system <br />or "fourfold jathis" in the form of "Brahmins, Kings, Vaishyas and <br />Vellalas,"[35] and calls Vedic mantras "the exalted expression of <br />great sages."[36]<br />The Tolkappiyam also formulates the captivating division of the Tamil <br />land into five regions (tinai ), each associated with one particular <br />aspect of love, one poetical expression, and also one deity : thus <br />the hills (kuriÃ±ji ) with union and with Cheyon (Murugan) ; the <br />desert (palai ) with separation and Korravai (Durga) ; the forests <br />(mullai ) with awaiting and Mayon (Vishnu-Krishna) ; the seashore <br />(neytal ) with wailing and Varuna ; and the cultivated lands <br />(marutam) with quarrel and Ventan (Indra). Thus from the beginning we <br />have a fusion of non-Vedic deities (Murugan or Korravai), Vedic gods <br />(Indra, Varuna) and later Puranic deities such as Vishnu (Mal or <br />Tirumal). Such a synthesis is quite typical of the Hindu temperament <br />and cannot be the result of an overnight or superficial influence ; <br />it is also as remote as possible from the separateness we are told is <br />at the root of so-called "Dravidian culture."<br />Expectedly, this fusion grows by leaps and bounds in classical Sangam <br />poetry whose composers were Brahmins, princes, merchants, farmers, <br />including a number of women. The "Eight Anthologies" of poetry (or <br />ettuttokai ) abound in references to many gods : Shiva, Uma, Murugan, <br />Vishnu, Lakshmi (named Tiru, which corresponds to Sri) and several <br />other Saktis.[37] The Paripadal, one of those anthologies, consists <br />almost entirely of devotional poetry to Vishnu. One poem[38] begins <br />with a homage to him and Lakshmi, and goes on to praise Garuda, Shiva <br />on his "majestic bull," the four-faced Brahma, the twelve Adityas, <br />the Ashwins, the Rudras, the Saptarishis, Indra with his "dreaded <br />thunderbolt," the devas and asuras, etc., and makes glowing <br />references to the Vedas and Vedic scholars.[39] So does the <br />Purananuru,[40] another of the eight anthologies, which in addition <br />sees Lord Shiva as the source of the four Vedas (166) and describes <br />Lord Vishnu as "blue-hued" (174) and "Garuda-bannered" (56).[41] <br />Similarly, a poem (360) of a third anthology, the Akananuru, declares <br />that Shiva and Vishnu are the greatest of gods[42]<br />Not only deities or scriptures, landmarks sacred in the North, such <br />as the Himalayas or Ganga, also become objects of great veneration in <br />Tamil poetry. North Indian cities are referred to, such as Ujjain, or <br />Mathura after which Madurai was named. Court poets proudly claim that <br />the Chera kings conquered North Indian kingdoms and carved their <br />emblem onto the Himalayas. They clearly saw the subcontinent as one <br />entity ; thus the Purananuru says they ruled over "the whole land / <br />With regions of hills, mountains, / Forests and inhabited lands / <br />Having the Southern Kumari / And the great Northern Mount / And the <br />Eastern and Western seas / As their borders...."[43]<br />The Kural (second to seventh century AD), authored by the celebrated <br />Tiruvalluvar, is often described as an "atheistic" text, a hasty <br />misconception. True, Valluvar's 1,330 pithy aphorisms mostly deal <br />with ethics (aram), polity (porul) and love (inbam), following the <br />traditional Sanskritic pattern of the four objects of human life : <br />dharma, artha, kama, and mokshaÂ—the last implied rather than <br />explicit. Still, the very first decade is an invocation to <br />Bhagavan : "The ocean of births can be crossed by those who clasp <br />God's feet, and none else"[44] (10) ; the same idea recurs later, for <br />instance in this profound thought : "Cling to the One who clings to <br />nothing ; and so clinging, cease to cling" (350). The Kural also <br />refers to Indra (25), to Vishnu's avatar of Vamana (610), and to <br />Lakshmi (e.g. 167), asserting that she will shower her grace only on <br />those who follow the path of dharma (179, 920). There is nothing very <br />atheistic in all this, and in reality the values of the Kural are <br />perfectly in tune with those found in several shastras or in the Gita.<br />[45]<br />Let us briefly turn to the famous Tamil epic Shilappadikaram (second <br />to sixth century ad), which relates the beautiful and tragic story of <br />Kannagi and Kovalan ; it opens with invocations to Chandra, Surya, <br />and Indra, all of them Vedic Gods, and frequently praises Agni, <br />Varuna, Shiva, Subrahmanya, Vishnu-Krishna, Uma, Kali, Yama and so <br />forth. There are mentions of the four Vedas and of "Vedic sacrifices <br />being faultlessly performed." "In more than one place," writes V. <br />Ramachandra Dikshitar, the first translator of the epic into <br />English, "there are references to Vedic Brahmans, their fire rites, <br />and their chanting of the Vedic hymns. The Brahman received much <br />respect from the king and was often given gifts of wealth and <br />cattle."[46] When Kovalan and Kannagi are married, they "walk around <br />the holy fire," a typically Vedic rite still at the centre of the <br />Hindu wedding. Welcomed by a tribe of fierce hunters on their way to <br />Madurai, they witness a striking apparition of Durga, who is <br />addressed equally as Lakshmi and SarasvatiÂ—the three Shaktis of the <br />Hindu trinity. There are numerous references to legends from the <br />Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Puranas. After worshipping at two <br />temples, one of Vishnu and the other of Shiva, the Chera king <br />Shenguttuvan goes to the Himalayas in search of a stone for Kannagi's <br />idol, and bathes it in the GangesÂ—in fact, the waters of Ganga and <br />those of Cauvery were said to be equally sacred. Similar examples <br />could be given from the Manimekhalai : even though it is a <br />predominantly Buddhist work, it also mentions many Vedic and Puranic <br />gods, and attributes the submergence of Puhar to the neglect of a <br />festival to Indra.<br />As the archaeologist and epigraphist R. Nagaswamy remarks, "The fact <br />that the literature of the Sangam age refers more to Vedic sacrifices <br />than to temples is a pointer to the popularity of the Vedic cults <br />among the Sangam Tamils."[47]<br />I should also make a mention of the tradition that regards Agastya, <br />the great Vedic Rishi, as the originator of the Tamil language. He is <br />said to have written a Tamil grammar, Agattiyam, to have presided <br />over the first two Sangams, and is even now honoured in many temples <br />of Tamil Nadu and worshipped in many homes. One of his traditional <br />names is "Tamil muni." The Shilappadikaram refers to him as "the <br />great sage of the Podiyil hill," and a hill is still today named <br />after him at the southernmost tip of the Western Ghats.<br />It would be tempting to continue with this enumeration, which could <br />easily fill a whole anthology. As a matter of fact, P. S. Subrahmanya <br />Sastri showed with a wealth of examples how "a knowledge of Sanskrit <br />literature from the Vedic period to the Classical period is essential <br />to understand and appreciate a large number of passages scattered <br />among the poems of Tamil literature."[48] Others have added to the <br />long list of such examples.[ 49] In other words, Vedic and Puranic <br />themes are inextricably woven into Sangam literature and therefore <br />into the most ancient culture of the Tamil land known to us.<br />Historical Period<br />The historical period naturally takes us to the great Pallava, Chola <br />and Pandya temples and to an overflowing of devotional literature by <br />the Alwars, the Nayanmars and other seekers of the Divine who <br />wandered over the length and breadth of the Tamil land, filling it <br />with bhakti. But here let us just take a look at the rulers. An <br />inscription records that a Pandya king led the elephant force in the <br />Mahabharata War on behalf of the Pandavas, and that early Pandyas <br />translated the epic into Tamil.[50] The first named Chera king, <br />Udiyanjeral, is said to have sumptuously fed the armies on both sides <br />during the War at Kurukshetra ; Chola and Pandya kings also voiced <br />such claimsÂ—of course they may be devoid of historical basis, but <br />they show how those kings sought to enhance their glory by connecting <br />their lineage to heroes of the Mahabharata. So too, Chola and Chera <br />kings proudly claimed descent from Lord Rama or from kings of the <br />Lunar dynastyÂ—in other words, an "Aryan" descent. <br />As regards religious practices, the greatest Chola king, Karikala, <br />was a patron of both the Vedic religion and Tamil literature, while <br />the Pandya king Nedunjelyan performed many Vedic sacrifices, and the <br />dynasty of the Pallavas made their capital Kanchi into a great centre <br />of Sanskrit learning and culture. K. V. Raman summarizes <br />the "religious inheritance of the Pandyas" in these words :<br />The Pandyan kings were great champions of the Vedic religion from <br />very early times.... According to the Sinnamanur plates, one of the <br />early Pandyan kings performed a thousand velvi or yagas Vedic <br />sacrifices.... Though the majority of the Pandyan kings were <br />Saivites, they extended equal patronage to the other faiths ... and <br />included invocatory verses to the Hindu Trinity uniformly in all <br />their copper-plate grants. The Pandyas patronised all the six systems <br />or schools of Hinduism.... Their religion was not one of narrow <br />sectarian nature but broad-based with Vedic roots. They were free <br />from linguistic or regional bias and took pride in saying that they <br />considered Tamil and Sanskritic studies as complementary and equally <br />valuable.[51]<br />This pluralism can already be seen in the two epics Shilappadikaram <br />and Manimekhalai, which amply testify that what we call today <br />Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism coexisted harmoniously. "The sectarian <br />spirit was totally absent,"[52] writes Ramachandra Dikshitar. "Either <br />the people did not look upon religious distinctions seriously, or <br />there were no fundamental differences between one sect and <br />another."[53]<br />That is also a reason why I have not stressed Buddhism and Jainism <br />here. Those two faiths were no doubt significant in the early stages <br />of Tamil society, but not as dominant as certain scholars insist upon <br />in an attempt to eclipse the Vedic and Puranic elements. Buddhism and <br />Jainism did contribute greatly in terms of religious thought, art and <br />science, but faded centuries later under the flood of Hindu bhakti ; <br />their insistence on world-shunning monasticism also did not agree <br />very well with the Tamil temperament, its cult of heroism and its <br />zest for life.<br />In any case, this superficial glance at Sangam literature makes it <br />clear at the very least that, in the words of John R. Marr, "these <br />poems show that the synthesis between Tamil culture and what may <br />loosely be termed Aryan culture was already far advanced.[ 54] <br />Nilakanta Sastri goes a step further and opines, "There does not <br />exist a single line of Tamil literature written before the Tamils <br />came into contact with, and let us add accepted with genuine <br />appreciation, the Indo-Aryan culture of North Indian origin."[55] <br />The Myth of Dravidian Culture<br />And yet, such statements do not go deep enough, as they still imply a <br />North-South contrast and an unknown Dravidian substratum over which <br />the layer of "Aryan" culture was deposited. This view is only milder <br />than that of the proponents of a "separate" and "secular" Dravidian <br />culture, who insist on a physical and cultural Aryan-Dravidian clash <br />as a result of which the pure "Dravidian" culture got swamped. As we <br />have seen, archaeology, literature and Tamil tradition all fail to <br />come up with the slightest hint of such a conflict. Rather, as far as <br />the eye can see into the past there is every sign of a deep cultural <br />interaction between North and South, which blossomed not through <br />any "imposition" but in a natural and peaceful manner, as everywhere <br />else in the subcontinent and beyond.<br />As regards an imaginary Dravidian "secularism" (another quite inept <br />word to use in the Indian context), it has been posited by many <br />scholars : Marr,[56] Zvelebil[57] and others characterize Sangam <br />poetry as "secular" and "pre-Aryan"[58] after severing its heroic or <br />love themes from its strong spiritual undercurrents, in a feat <br />typical of Western scholarship whose scrutiny always depends more on <br />the magnifying glass than on the wide-angle lens. A far more <br />insightful view comes from the historian M. G. S. Narayanan, who <br />finds in Sangam literature "no trace of another, indigenous, culture <br />other than what may be designated as tribal and primitive."[ 59] He <br />concludes :<br />The Aryan-Dravidian or Aryan-Tamil dichotomy envisaged by some <br />scholars may have to be given up since we are unable to come across <br />anything which could be designated as purely Aryan or purely <br />Dravidian in the character of South India of the Sangam Age. In view <br />of this, the Sangam culture has to be looked upon as expressing in a <br />local idiom all the essential features of classical "Hindu" culture.[ <br />60]<br />However, it is not as if the Tamil land passively received this <br />culture : in exchange it generously gave elements from its own rich <br />temperament and spirit. In fact, all four Southern States massively <br />added to every genre of Sanskrit literature, not to speak of the <br />signal contributions of a Shankara, a Ramanuja or a Madhwa. Cultural <br />kinship does not mean that there is nothing distinctive about South <br />Indian tradition ; the Tamil land can justly be proud of its ancient <br />language, culture and genius, which have a strong stamp and character <br />of their own, as anyone who browses through Sangam texts can <br />immediately see : for all the mentions of gods, more often than not <br />they just provide a backdrop ; what occupies the mind of the poets is <br />the human side, its heroism or delicate emotions, its bouncy <br />vitality, refined sensualism or its sweet love of Nature. "Vivid <br />pictures of full-blooded life exhibiting itself in all its varied <br />moods," as Raghunathan puts it. "One cannot but be impressed by the <br />extraordinary vitality, variety and richness of the poetic <br />achievement of the old Tamil."[61] Ganapathy Subbiah adds, "The <br />aesthetic quality of many of the poems is breathtakingly <br />refined."[62] It is true also that the Tamil language developed its <br />own literature along certain independent lines ; conventions of <br />poetry, for instance, are strikingly original and more often than not <br />different from those of Sanskrit literature. <br />More importantly, many scholars suggest that "the bhakti movement <br />began in the Tamil country and later spread to North India."[63] <br />Subbiah, in a profound study, not only challenges the <br />misconceived "secular" portrayal of the Sangam texts, but also the <br />attribution of the Tamil bhakti to a northern origin ; rather, he <br />suggests, it was distinctly a creation of Tamil culture, and Sangam <br />literature "a reflection of the religious culture of the Tamils."[64]<br />As regards the fundamental contributions of the South to temple <br />architecture, music, dance and to the spread of Hindu culture to <br />other South Asian countries, they are too well known to be repeated <br />here. Besides, the region played a crucial role in preserving many <br />important Sanskrit texts (a few Vedic recensions, Bhasa's dramas, the <br />Arthashastra for instance) better than the North was able to do, and <br />even today some of India's best Vedic scholars are found in Tamil <br />Nadu and Kerala.[*] As Swami Vivekananda put it, "The South had been <br />the repository of Vedic learning."[65]<br />In other words, what is loosely called Hinduism would not be what it <br />is without the South. To use the proverbial but apt image, the <br />outflow from the Tamil land was a major tributary to the great river <br />of Indian culture.<br />Conclusion<br />It should now be crystal clear that anyone claiming <br />a "separate," "pre-Aryan" or "secular" Dravidian culture has no <br />evidence to show for it, except his own ignorance of archaeology, <br />numismatics and ancient Tamil literature. Not only was there never <br />such a culture, there is in fact no meaning in the word "Dravidian" <br />except either in the old geographical sense or in the modern <br />linguistic sense ; racial and cultural meanings are as unscientific <br />as they are irrational, although some scholars in India remain <br />obstinately rooted in a colonial mindset.<br />The simple reality is that every region of India has developed <br />according to its own genius, creating in its own bent, but while <br />remaining faithful to the central Indian spirit. The Tamil land was <br />certainly one of the most creative, and we must hope to see more of <br />its generosity once warped notions about its ancient culture are out <br />of the way.<br />References <br />* I am grateful to Dr. K. V. Raman (also to Drs. Iravatham Mahadevan, <br />K. V. Ramesh and S. Kalyanaraman) for kindly suggesting some of the <br />sources I have used, and for providing me with important clues ; of <br />course I am solely responsible for my treatment of them and the <br />conclusions I suggest. May I add that this admittedly incomplete <br />overview is aimed mostly at the educated non-specialist Indian <br />public, and that I am myself a student of India, not a scholar.<br />(In this Web version, I have removed here all diacritical marks to <br />avoid confusions; they will be restored in the published version.)<br />* I use the word "culture" in its ordinary meaning, not in the <br />technical sense used by archaeologists, i.e. the totality of material <br />artefacts of a particular category of settlement.<br />[*] The word "Hindu" is as convenient as it is unsatisfactory ; I use <br />it in a broad sense that encompasses Vedic, Epic, Puranic culture, <br />but without being exclusive of Buddhist or Jain faiths.<br />* In the district of Chittoor (A.P.) near the present Tamil Nadu <br />border ; this area was then regarded as part of Tamilaga (which <br />extended as far north as present-day Tirupati).<br />* Sangam texts are notoriously hard to date and there is among <br />scholars nearly as much divergence of views as with Sanskrit texts. <br />Thus some date the Tolkappiyam as late as the fifth or sixth century <br />AD.<br />* I dare say that many more ancient texts remain to be discovered <br />among palm-leaf manuscripts in Tamil Nadu or Kerala (many of which <br />are being mindlessly lost or destroyed for want of active interest). <br />For instance, I was once shown in Kerala, among many ancient texts, a <br />thick palm-leaf manuscript of a Ramayana by ... Vyasa. (Some <br />traditions do mention it, but it has been regarded as lost.) Post-<br />Independence India has been prodigiously careless in preserving its <br />cultural heritage.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://micheldanino.voiceofdharma.com/tamilculture.html">http://micheldanino.voiceofdharma.com/tamilculture.html</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content">Vedic Roots of Early Tamil Culture<br /><br /> <br />Summarized versions of this paper were presented at the Naimisha <br />Vedic Workshop, "Looking beyond the Aryan Invasion," organized by <br />Naimisha Foundation at Bangalore on March 12-13, 2001, and at the <br />National Seminar on Origins of United Vedic Culture organized by <br />Pragna Bharati and sponsored by the Indian Council of Historical <br />Research at Hyderabad on March 17-18, 2001. [*] <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In recent years attempts have been made to cast a new look at ancient <br />India. For too long the picture has been distorted by myopic colonial <br />readings of India's prehistory and early history, and more recently <br />by ill-suited Marxist models. One such distortion was the Aryan <br />invasion theory, now definitively on its way out, although its <br />watered-down avatars are still struggling to survive. It will no <br />doubt take some more timeÂ—and much more effort on the archaeological <br />frontÂ—for a new perspective of the earliest civilization in the North <br />of the subcontinent to take firm shape, but a beginning has been made.<br />We have a peculiar situation too as regards Southern India, and <br />particularly Tamil Nadu. Take any classic account of Indian history <br />and you will see how little space the South gets in comparison with <br />the North. While rightly complaining that "Hitherto most historians <br />of ancient India have written as if the south did not exist,"[ 1]<br />Vincent Smith in his Oxford History of India hardly devotes a few <br />pages to civilization in the South, that too with the usual <br />stereotypes to which I will return shortly. R. C. Majumdar's Advanced <br />History of India,[2] or A. L. Basham's The Wonder That Was India[3] <br />are hardly better in that respect. The first serious History of South <br />India,[4] that of K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, appeared only in 1947. Even <br />recent surveys of Indian archaeology generally give the South a <br />rather cursory treatment.<br />The Context<br />It is a fact that archaeology in the South has so far unearthed <br />little that can compare to findings in the North in terms of <br />ancientness, massiveness or sophistication : the emergence of urban <br />civilization in Tamil Nadu is now fixed at the second or third <br />century BC, about two and a half millennia after the appearance of <br />Indus cities. Moreover, we do not have any fully or largely excavated <br />city or even medium-sized town : Madurai, the ancient capital of the <br />Pandya kingdom, has hardly been explored at all ; Uraiyur, that of <br />the early Cholas, saw a dozen trenches ;[5] Kanchipuram, the <br />Pallavas' capital, had seventeen, and Karur, that of the Cheras, <br />hardly more ; Kaveripattinam,[6] part of the famous ancient city of <br />Puhar (the first setting of the Shilappadikaram epic), saw more <br />widespread excavations, yet limited with regard to the potential the <br />site offers. The same may be said of Arikamedu (just south of <br />Pondicherry), despite excavations by Jouveau-Dubreuil, Wheeler, and <br />several other teams right up to the 1990s.[7]<br />All in all, the archaeological record scarcely measures up to what <br />emerges from the Indo-Gangetic plainsÂ—which is one reason why <br />awareness of these excavations has hardly reached the general public, <br />even in Tamil Nadu ; it has heard more about the still superficial <br />exploration of submerged Poompuhar than about the painstaking work <br />done in recent decades at dozens of sites. (See a map of Tamil Nadu's <br />important archaeological sites below.)<br />But there is a second reason for this poor awareness : scholars and <br />politicians drawing inspiration from the Dravidian movement launched <br />by E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker ("Periyar") have very rigid ideas about <br />the ancient history of Tamil Nadu. First, despite all evidence to the <br />contrary, they still insist on the Aryan invasion theory in its most <br />violent version, turning most North Indians and upper-caste Indians <br />into descendants of the invading Aryans who overran the indigenous <br />Dravidians, and Sanskrit into a deadly rival of Tamil. Consequently, <br />they assert that Tamil is more ancient than Sanskrit, and <br />civilization in the South older than in the North. Thus recently, <br />Tamil Nadu's Education minister decried in the State Assembly those <br />who go "to the extent of saying that Dravidian civilization is part <br />of Hinduism" and declared, "The Dravidian civilization is older than <br />the Aryan."[8] It is not uncommon to hear even good Tamil scholars <br />utter such claims.<br />Now, it so happens that archaeological findings in Tamil Nadu, though <br />scanty, are nevertheless decisive. Indeed, we now have a broad <br />convergence between literary, epigraphic and archaeological evidence.<br />[9] Thus names of cities, kings and chieftains mentioned in Sangam <br />literature have often been confirmed by inscriptions and coins dating <br />back to the second and third centuries BC. Kautilya speaks in his <br />Arthashastra (c. fourth century BC) of the "easily travelled southern <br />land route," with diamonds, precious stones and pearls from the <br />Pandya country ;[10] two Ashokan rock edicts (II and XIII[11]) <br />respectfully refer to Chola, Pandya and Chera kingdoms <br />as "neighbours," therefore placing them firmly in the third century <br />BC ; we also have Kharavela's cave inscription near Bhubaneswar in <br />which the Kalinga king (c. 150 BC) boasts of having broken up <br />a "confederacy of the Dravida countries which had lasted for 113 <br />years."[12] From: all these, it appears that the earliest Tamil <br />kingdoms must have been established around the fourth century BC ; <br />again, archaeological findings date urban developments a century or <br />two later, but this small gap will likely be filled by more extensive <br />excavations. But there's the rub : beyond the fourth century BC and <br />back to 700 or 1000 BC, all we find is a megalithic period, and going <br />still further back, a neolithic period starting from about the third <br />millennium BC. While those two prehistoric periods are as important <br />as they are enigmatic, they show little sign of a complex culture,[*] <br />and no clear connection with the dawn of urban civilization in the <br />South.<br />Therefore the good minister's assertion as to the greater ancientness <br />of the "Dravidian civilization" finds no support on the ground. In <br />order to test his second assertion that that civilization is outside <br />Hinduism, or the common claim that so-called "Dravidian culture" is <br />wholly separate from so-called "Aryan" culture, let us take an <br />unbiased look at the cultural backdrop of early Tamil society and try <br />to make out some of its mainstays. That is what I propose to do <br />briefly, using not only literary evidence, but first, material <br />evidence from archaeological and numismatic sources as regards the <br />dawn of the Sangam age. I may add that I have left out the Buddhist <br />and Jain elements, already sufficiently well known, to concentrate on <br />the Vedic and Puranic ones, which are usually underemphasized. Also, <br />I will not deal here with the origin of South Indian people and <br />languages, or with the nature of the process often <br />called "Aryanization of the South" (I prefer the <br />word "Indianization," used in this context by an archaeologist[13]). <br />Those complex questions have been debated for decades, and will only <br />reach firm conclusions, I believe, with ampler archaeological <br />evidence.<br /><br /><br /><br />Map of some settlements of archelogical importance in Tamil Nadu<br /><br /><br /><br />Vedic & Puranic CultureÂ—Material Evidence<br />Culturally, the megalithic people of the South shared many beliefs <br />and practices with megalithic builders elsewhere in the subcontinent <br />and beyond. Yet certain practices and artefacts were at least <br />compatible with the Vedic world and may well have prepared for a <br />ready acceptance of Vedic conceptsÂ—a natural assimilative process <br />still observable in what has been called the "Hinduization" of <br />tribals. Thus several cists surrounded by stone-circles have four <br />vertical slabs arranged in the shape of a swastika.[14] The famous <br />3.5 metre-high figure of Mottur (in North Arcot district), carved out <br />of a granite slab, is "perhaps the first anthropomorphic <br />representation of a god in stone in Tamil Nadu."[15] Some megalithic <br />burials have yielded iron or bronze objects such as mother goddess, <br />horned masks, the trishul etc. As the archaeologist I. K. Sarma <br />observes, such objects are<br />intimately connected with the worship of brahmanical Gods of the <br />historical period, such as Siva, Kartikeya and later Amba. The <br />diadems of Adichanallur burials are like the mouth-pieces used by the <br />devotees of Murugan.[ 16]<br />The archaeologist K. V. Raman also notes :<br />Some form of Mother-Goddess worship was prevalent in the Megalithic <br />period ... as suggested by the discovery of a small copper image of a <br />Goddess in the urn-burials of Adichchanallur. More recently, in <br />Megalithic burials the headstone, shaped like the seated Mother, has <br />been located at two places in Tamil Nadu.[17]<br />Megalithic culture attached great importance to the cult of the dead <br />and ancestors, which parallels that in Vedic culture. It is also <br />likely that certain gods later absorbed into the Hindu pantheon, such <br />as Aiyanar (or Sastha), Murugan (the later Kartik), Korravai (Durga), <br />Naga deities, etc., were originally tribal gods of that period. <br />Though probably of later date, certain megalithic sites in the <br />Nilgiris were actually dolmen shrines, some of them holding Ganesh-<br />like images, others lingams.[ 18] Megalithic practices evocative of <br />later Hinduism are thus summarized by the British archaeologists <br />Bridget and Raymond Allchin :<br />The orientation of port-holes and entrances on the cist graves is <br />frequently towards the south. ... This demands comparison with later <br />Indian tradition where south is the quarter of Yama. Among the grave <br />goods, iron is almost universal, and the occasional iron spears and <br />tridents (trisulas) suggest an association with the god Siva. The <br />discovery in one grave of a trident with a wrought-iron buffalo fixed <br />to the shaft is likewise suggestive, for the buffalo is also <br />associated with Yama, and the buffalo demon was slain by the goddess <br />Durga, consort of Siva, with a trident. ... The picture which we <br />obtain from this evidence, slight as it is, is suggestive of some <br />form of worship of Siva.[ 19]<br />About the third century BC, cities and towns appear owing to yet <br />little understood factors ; exchanges with the Mauryan and Roman <br />empires seem to have played an important catalytic role, as also the <br />advent of iron. From: the very beginning, Buddhist, Jain and Hindu[*] <br />streaks are all clear.<br />Among the earliest evidences, a stratigraphic dig by I. K. Sarma <br />within the garbagriha of the Parasuramesvara temple at Gudimallam,[*] <br />brought to light the foundation of a remarkable Shivalingam of the <br />Mauryan period (possibly third century BC) : it was fixed within two <br />circular pithas at the centre of a square vastu-mandala. "The deity <br />on the frontal face of the tall linga reveals himself as a proto-<br />puranic Agni-Rudra"[20] standing on a kneeling devayana. If this <br />early date, which Sarma established on stratigraphic grounds and from <br />pottery sherds, is correct, this fearsome image could well be the <br />earliest such representation in the South.<br />Then we find "terracotta figures like Mother Goddess, Naga-linga <br />etc., from Tirukkampuliyur ; a seated Ganesa from Alagarai ; <br />Vriskshadevata and Mother Goddess from Kaveripakkam and Kanchipuram, <br />in almost certainly a pre-Pallava sequence."[21] Cult of a Mother <br />goddess is also noticed in the early levels at Uraiyur,[22] and at <br />Kaveripattinam, Kanchipuram and Arikamedu.[ 23] Excavations at <br />Kaveripattinam have brought to light many Buddhist artefacts, but <br />also, though of later date, a few figurines of Yakshas, of Garuda and <br />Ganesh.[24] Evidence of the Yaksha cult also comes from pottery <br />inscriptions at Arikamedu.[25]<br />The same site also yielded one square copper coin of the early <br />Cholas, depicting on the obverse an elephant, a ritual umbrella, the <br />Srivatsa symbol, and the front portion of a horse.[ 26] This is in <br />fact an important theme which recurs on many coins of the Sangam age<br />[27] recovered mostly from river beds near Karur, Madurai etc. <br />Besides the Srivatsa (also found among artefacts at Kanchipuram[28]), <br />many coins depict a swastika, a trishul, a conch, a shadarachakra, a <br />damaru, a crescent moon, and a sun with four, eight or twelve rays. <br />Quite a few coins clearly show a yagnakunda. That is mostly the case <br />with the Pandyas' coins, some of which also portray a yubastambha to <br />which a horse is tied as part of the ashvamedha sacrifice. As the <br />numismatist R. Krishnamurthy puts it, "The importance of Pandya coins <br />of Vedic sacrifice series lies in the fact that these coins <br />corroborate what we know from Sangam literature about the performance <br />of Vedic sacrifices by a Pandya king of this age."[29]<br />Finally, it is remarkable how a single coin often depicts symbols <br />normally associated with Lord Vishnu (the conch, the srivatsa, the <br />chakra) together with symbols normally associated with Lord Shiva <br />(the trishul, the crescent moon, the damaru).[30] Clearly, the <br />two "sects"Â—a very clumsy wordÂ—got along well enough. Interestingly, <br />other symbols depicted on these coins, such as the three- or six-<br />arched hill, the tree-in-railing, and the ritual stand in front of a <br />horse, are frequently found in Mauryan iconography.[31]<br />All in all, the material evidence, though still meagre, makes it <br />clear that Hindu concepts and cults were already integrated in the <br />society of the early historic period of Tamil Nadu side by side with <br />Buddhist and Jain elements. More excavations, for which there is <br />great scope, are certain to confirm this, especially if they <br />concentrate on ancient places of worship, as at Gudimallam. Let us <br />now see the picture we get from Sangam literature.<br />Vedic & Puranic CultureÂ—Literary Evidence<br />It is unfortunate that the most ancient Sangam compositions are <br />probably lost for ever ; we only know of them through brief <br />quotations in later works. An early text, the Tamil grammar <br />Tolkappiyam, dated by most scholars to the first or second century AD,<br />[*] is "said to have been modelled on the Sanskrit grammar of the <br />Aindra school."[32] Its content, says N. Raghunathan, shows that "the <br />great literature of Sanskrit and the work of its grammarians and <br />rhetoricians were well known and provided stimulus to creative <br />writers in Tamil.... The Tolkappiyam adopts the entire Rasa theory as <br />worked out in the Natya Sastra of Bharata."[33] It also refers to <br />rituals and customs coming from the "Aryans," a word which in Sangam <br />literature simply means North Indians of Vedic culture ; for <br />instance, the Tolkappiyam "states definitely that marriage as a <br />sacrament attended with ritual was established in the Tamil country <br />by the Aryas,"[ 34] and it uses the same eight forms of marriage <br />found in the Dharmashastras. Moreover, it mentions the caste system <br />or "fourfold jathis" in the form of "Brahmins, Kings, Vaishyas and <br />Vellalas,"[35] and calls Vedic mantras "the exalted expression of <br />great sages."[36]<br />The Tolkappiyam also formulates the captivating division of the Tamil <br />land into five regions (tinai ), each associated with one particular <br />aspect of love, one poetical expression, and also one deity : thus <br />the hills (kuriÃ±ji ) with union and with Cheyon (Murugan) ; the <br />desert (palai ) with separation and Korravai (Durga) ; the forests <br />(mullai ) with awaiting and Mayon (Vishnu-Krishna) ; the seashore <br />(neytal ) with wailing and Varuna ; and the cultivated lands <br />(marutam) with quarrel and Ventan (Indra). Thus from the beginning we <br />have a fusion of non-Vedic deities (Murugan or Korravai), Vedic gods <br />(Indra, Varuna) and later Puranic deities such as Vishnu (Mal or <br />Tirumal). Such a synthesis is quite typical of the Hindu temperament <br />and cannot be the result of an overnight or superficial influence ; <br />it is also as remote as possible from the separateness we are told is <br />at the root of so-called "Dravidian culture."<br />Expectedly, this fusion grows by leaps and bounds in classical Sangam <br />poetry whose composers were Brahmins, princes, merchants, farmers, <br />including a number of women. The "Eight Anthologies" of poetry (or <br />ettuttokai ) abound in references to many gods : Shiva, Uma, Murugan, <br />Vishnu, Lakshmi (named Tiru, which corresponds to Sri) and several <br />other Saktis.[37] The Paripadal, one of those anthologies, consists <br />almost entirely of devotional poetry to Vishnu. One poem[38] begins <br />with a homage to him and Lakshmi, and goes on to praise Garuda, Shiva <br />on his "majestic bull," the four-faced Brahma, the twelve Adityas, <br />the Ashwins, the Rudras, the Saptarishis, Indra with his "dreaded <br />thunderbolt," the devas and asuras, etc., and makes glowing <br />references to the Vedas and Vedic scholars.[39] So does the <br />Purananuru,[40] another of the eight anthologies, which in addition <br />sees Lord Shiva as the source of the four Vedas (166) and describes <br />Lord Vishnu as "blue-hued" (174) and "Garuda-bannered" (56).[41] <br />Similarly, a poem (360) of a third anthology, the Akananuru, declares <br />that Shiva and Vishnu are the greatest of gods[42]<br />Not only deities or scriptures, landmarks sacred in the North, such <br />as the Himalayas or Ganga, also become objects of great veneration in <br />Tamil poetry. North Indian cities are referred to, such as Ujjain, or <br />Mathura after which Madurai was named. Court poets proudly claim that <br />the Chera kings conquered North Indian kingdoms and carved their <br />emblem onto the Himalayas. They clearly saw the subcontinent as one <br />entity ; thus the Purananuru says they ruled over "the whole land / <br />With regions of hills, mountains, / Forests and inhabited lands / <br />Having the Southern Kumari / And the great Northern Mount / And the <br />Eastern and Western seas / As their borders...."[43]<br />The Kural (second to seventh century AD), authored by the celebrated <br />Tiruvalluvar, is often described as an "atheistic" text, a hasty <br />misconception. True, Valluvar's 1,330 pithy aphorisms mostly deal <br />with ethics (aram), polity (porul) and love (inbam), following the <br />traditional Sanskritic pattern of the four objects of human life : <br />dharma, artha, kama, and mokshaÂ—the last implied rather than <br />explicit. Still, the very first decade is an invocation to <br />Bhagavan : "The ocean of births can be crossed by those who clasp <br />God's feet, and none else"[44] (10) ; the same idea recurs later, for <br />instance in this profound thought : "Cling to the One who clings to <br />nothing ; and so clinging, cease to cling" (350). The Kural also <br />refers to Indra (25), to Vishnu's avatar of Vamana (610), and to <br />Lakshmi (e.g. 167), asserting that she will shower her grace only on <br />those who follow the path of dharma (179, 920). There is nothing very <br />atheistic in all this, and in reality the values of the Kural are <br />perfectly in tune with those found in several shastras or in the Gita.<br />[45]<br />Let us briefly turn to the famous Tamil epic Shilappadikaram (second <br />to sixth century ad), which relates the beautiful and tragic story of <br />Kannagi and Kovalan ; it opens with invocations to Chandra, Surya, <br />and Indra, all of them Vedic Gods, and frequently praises Agni, <br />Varuna, Shiva, Subrahmanya, Vishnu-Krishna, Uma, Kali, Yama and so <br />forth. There are mentions of the four Vedas and of "Vedic sacrifices <br />being faultlessly performed." "In more than one place," writes V. <br />Ramachandra Dikshitar, the first translator of the epic into <br />English, "there are references to Vedic Brahmans, their fire rites, <br />and their chanting of the Vedic hymns. The Brahman received much <br />respect from the king and was often given gifts of wealth and <br />cattle."[46] When Kovalan and Kannagi are married, they "walk around <br />the holy fire," a typically Vedic rite still at the centre of the <br />Hindu wedding. Welcomed by a tribe of fierce hunters on their way to <br />Madurai, they witness a striking apparition of Durga, who is <br />addressed equally as Lakshmi and SarasvatiÂ—the three Shaktis of the <br />Hindu trinity. There are numerous references to legends from the <br />Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Puranas. After worshipping at two <br />temples, one of Vishnu and the other of Shiva, the Chera king <br />Shenguttuvan goes to the Himalayas in search of a stone for Kannagi's <br />idol, and bathes it in the GangesÂ—in fact, the waters of Ganga and <br />those of Cauvery were said to be equally sacred. Similar examples <br />could be given from the Manimekhalai : even though it is a <br />predominantly Buddhist work, it also mentions many Vedic and Puranic <br />gods, and attributes the submergence of Puhar to the neglect of a <br />festival to Indra.<br />As the archaeologist and epigraphist R. Nagaswamy remarks, "The fact <br />that the literature of the Sangam age refers more to Vedic sacrifices <br />than to temples is a pointer to the popularity of the Vedic cults <br />among the Sangam Tamils."[47]<br />I should also make a mention of the tradition that regards Agastya, <br />the great Vedic Rishi, as the originator of the Tamil language. He is <br />said to have written a Tamil grammar, Agattiyam, to have presided <br />over the first two Sangams, and is even now honoured in many temples <br />of Tamil Nadu and worshipped in many homes. One of his traditional <br />names is "Tamil muni." The Shilappadikaram refers to him as "the <br />great sage of the Podiyil hill," and a hill is still today named <br />after him at the southernmost tip of the Western Ghats.<br />It would be tempting to continue with this enumeration, which could <br />easily fill a whole anthology. As a matter of fact, P. S. Subrahmanya <br />Sastri showed with a wealth of examples how "a knowledge of Sanskrit <br />literature from the Vedic period to the Classical period is essential <br />to understand and appreciate a large number of passages scattered <br />among the poems of Tamil literature."[48] Others have added to the <br />long list of such examples.[ 49] In other words, Vedic and Puranic <br />themes are inextricably woven into Sangam literature and therefore <br />into the most ancient culture of the Tamil land known to us.<br />Historical Period<br />The historical period naturally takes us to the great Pallava, Chola <br />and Pandya temples and to an overflowing of devotional literature by <br />the Alwars, the Nayanmars and other seekers of the Divine who <br />wandered over the length and breadth of the Tamil land, filling it <br />with bhakti. But here let us just take a look at the rulers. An <br />inscription records that a Pandya king led the elephant force in the <br />Mahabharata War on behalf of the Pandavas, and that early Pandyas <br />translated the epic into Tamil.[50] The first named Chera king, <br />Udiyanjeral, is said to have sumptuously fed the armies on both sides <br />during the War at Kurukshetra ; Chola and Pandya kings also voiced <br />such claimsÂ—of course they may be devoid of historical basis, but <br />they show how those kings sought to enhance their glory by connecting <br />their lineage to heroes of the Mahabharata. So too, Chola and Chera <br />kings proudly claimed descent from Lord Rama or from kings of the <br />Lunar dynastyÂ—in other words, an "Aryan" descent. <br />As regards religious practices, the greatest Chola king, Karikala, <br />was a patron of both the Vedic religion and Tamil literature, while <br />the Pandya king Nedunjelyan performed many Vedic sacrifices, and the <br />dynasty of the Pallavas made their capital Kanchi into a great centre <br />of Sanskrit learning and culture. K. V. Raman summarizes <br />the "religious inheritance of the Pandyas" in these words :<br />The Pandyan kings were great champions of the Vedic religion from <br />very early times.... According to the Sinnamanur plates, one of the <br />early Pandyan kings performed a thousand velvi or yagas Vedic <br />sacrifices.... Though the majority of the Pandyan kings were <br />Saivites, they extended equal patronage to the other faiths ... and <br />included invocatory verses to the Hindu Trinity uniformly in all <br />their copper-plate grants. The Pandyas patronised all the six systems <br />or schools of Hinduism.... Their religion was not one of narrow <br />sectarian nature but broad-based with Vedic roots. They were free <br />from linguistic or regional bias and took pride in saying that they <br />considered Tamil and Sanskritic studies as complementary and equally <br />valuable.[51]<br />This pluralism can already be seen in the two epics Shilappadikaram <br />and Manimekhalai, which amply testify that what we call today <br />Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism coexisted harmoniously. "The sectarian <br />spirit was totally absent,"[52] writes Ramachandra Dikshitar. "Either <br />the people did not look upon religious distinctions seriously, or <br />there were no fundamental differences between one sect and <br />another."[53]<br />That is also a reason why I have not stressed Buddhism and Jainism <br />here. Those two faiths were no doubt significant in the early stages <br />of Tamil society, but not as dominant as certain scholars insist upon <br />in an attempt to eclipse the Vedic and Puranic elements. Buddhism and <br />Jainism did contribute greatly in terms of religious thought, art and <br />science, but faded centuries later under the flood of Hindu bhakti ; <br />their insistence on world-shunning monasticism also did not agree <br />very well with the Tamil temperament, its cult of heroism and its <br />zest for life.<br />In any case, this superficial glance at Sangam literature makes it <br />clear at the very least that, in the words of John R. Marr, "these <br />poems show that the synthesis between Tamil culture and what may <br />loosely be termed Aryan culture was already far advanced.[ 54] <br />Nilakanta Sastri goes a step further and opines, "There does not <br />exist a single line of Tamil literature written before the Tamils <br />came into contact with, and let us add accepted with genuine <br />appreciation, the Indo-Aryan culture of North Indian origin."[55] <br />The Myth of Dravidian Culture<br />And yet, such statements do not go deep enough, as they still imply a <br />North-South contrast and an unknown Dravidian substratum over which <br />the layer of "Aryan" culture was deposited. This view is only milder <br />than that of the proponents of a "separate" and "secular" Dravidian <br />culture, who insist on a physical and cultural Aryan-Dravidian clash <br />as a result of which the pure "Dravidian" culture got swamped. As we <br />have seen, archaeology, literature and Tamil tradition all fail to <br />come up with the slightest hint of such a conflict. Rather, as far as <br />the eye can see into the past there is every sign of a deep cultural <br />interaction between North and South, which blossomed not through <br />any "imposition" but in a natural and peaceful manner, as everywhere <br />else in the subcontinent and beyond.<br />As regards an imaginary Dravidian "secularism" (another quite inept <br />word to use in the Indian context), it has been posited by many <br />scholars : Marr,[56] Zvelebil[57] and others characterize Sangam <br />poetry as "secular" and "pre-Aryan"[58] after severing its heroic or <br />love themes from its strong spiritual undercurrents, in a feat <br />typical of Western scholarship whose scrutiny always depends more on <br />the magnifying glass than on the wide-angle lens. A far more <br />insightful view comes from the historian M. G. S. Narayanan, who <br />finds in Sangam literature "no trace of another, indigenous, culture <br />other than what may be designated as tribal and primitive."[ 59] He <br />concludes :<br />The Aryan-Dravidian or Aryan-Tamil dichotomy envisaged by some <br />scholars may have to be given up since we are unable to come across <br />anything which could be designated as purely Aryan or purely <br />Dravidian in the character of South India of the Sangam Age. In view <br />of this, the Sangam culture has to be looked upon as expressing in a <br />local idiom all the essential features of classical "Hindu" culture.[ <br />60]<br />However, it is not as if the Tamil land passively received this <br />culture : in exchange it generously gave elements from its own rich <br />temperament and spirit. In fact, all four Southern States massively <br />added to every genre of Sanskrit literature, not to speak of the <br />signal contributions of a Shankara, a Ramanuja or a Madhwa. Cultural <br />kinship does not mean that there is nothing distinctive about South <br />Indian tradition ; the Tamil land can justly be proud of its ancient <br />language, culture and genius, which have a strong stamp and character <br />of their own, as anyone who browses through Sangam texts can <br />immediately see : for all the mentions of gods, more often than not <br />they just provide a backdrop ; what occupies the mind of the poets is <br />the human side, its heroism or delicate emotions, its bouncy <br />vitality, refined sensualism or its sweet love of Nature. "Vivid <br />pictures of full-blooded life exhibiting itself in all its varied <br />moods," as Raghunathan puts it. "One cannot but be impressed by the <br />extraordinary vitality, variety and richness of the poetic <br />achievement of the old Tamil."[61] Ganapathy Subbiah adds, "The <br />aesthetic quality of many of the poems is breathtakingly <br />refined."[62] It is true also that the Tamil language developed its <br />own literature along certain independent lines ; conventions of <br />poetry, for instance, are strikingly original and more often than not <br />different from those of Sanskrit literature. <br />More importantly, many scholars suggest that "the bhakti movement <br />began in the Tamil country and later spread to North India."[63] <br />Subbiah, in a profound study, not only challenges the <br />misconceived "secular" portrayal of the Sangam texts, but also the <br />attribution of the Tamil bhakti to a northern origin ; rather, he <br />suggests, it was distinctly a creation of Tamil culture, and Sangam <br />literature "a reflection of the religious culture of the Tamils."[64]<br />As regards the fundamental contributions of the South to temple <br />architecture, music, dance and to the spread of Hindu culture to <br />other South Asian countries, they are too well known to be repeated <br />here. Besides, the region played a crucial role in preserving many <br />important Sanskrit texts (a few Vedic recensions, Bhasa's dramas, the <br />Arthashastra for instance) better than the North was able to do, and <br />even today some of India's best Vedic scholars are found in Tamil <br />Nadu and Kerala.[*] As Swami Vivekananda put it, "The South had been <br />the repository of Vedic learning."[65]<br />In other words, what is loosely called Hinduism would not be what it <br />is without the South. To use the proverbial but apt image, the <br />outflow from the Tamil land was a major tributary to the great river <br />of Indian culture.<br />Conclusion<br />It should now be crystal clear that anyone claiming <br />a "separate," "pre-Aryan" or "secular" Dravidian culture has no <br />evidence to show for it, except his own ignorance of archaeology, <br />numismatics and ancient Tamil literature. Not only was there never <br />such a culture, there is in fact no meaning in the word "Dravidian" <br />except either in the old geographical sense or in the modern <br />linguistic sense ; racial and cultural meanings are as unscientific <br />as they are irrational, although some scholars in India remain <br />obstinately rooted in a colonial mindset.<br />The simple reality is that every region of India has developed <br />according to its own genius, creating in its own bent, but while <br />remaining faithful to the central Indian spirit. The Tamil land was <br />certainly one of the most creative, and we must hope to see more of <br />its generosity once warped notions about its ancient culture are out <br />of the way.<br />References <br />* I am grateful to Dr. K. V. Raman (also to Drs. Iravatham Mahadevan, <br />K. V. Ramesh and S. Kalyanaraman) for kindly suggesting some of the <br />sources I have used, and for providing me with important clues ; of <br />course I am solely responsible for my treatment of them and the <br />conclusions I suggest. May I add that this admittedly incomplete <br />overview is aimed mostly at the educated non-specialist Indian <br />public, and that I am myself a student of India, not a scholar.<br />(In this Web version, I have removed here all diacritical marks to <br />avoid confusions; they will be restored in the published version.)<br />* I use the word "culture" in its ordinary meaning, not in the <br />technical sense used by archaeologists, i.e. the totality of material <br />artefacts of a particular category of settlement.<br />[*] The word "Hindu" is as convenient as it is unsatisfactory ; I use <br />it in a broad sense that encompasses Vedic, Epic, Puranic culture, <br />but without being exclusive of Buddhist or Jain faiths.<br />* In the district of Chittoor (A.P.) near the present Tamil Nadu <br />border ; this area was then regarded as part of Tamilaga (which <br />extended as far north as present-day Tirupati).<br />* Sangam texts are notoriously hard to date and there is among <br />scholars nearly as much divergence of views as with Sanskrit texts. <br />Thus some date the Tolkappiyam as late as the fifth or sixth century <br />AD.<br />* I dare say that many more ancient texts remain to be discovered <br />among palm-leaf manuscripts in Tamil Nadu or Kerala (many of which <br />are being mindlessly lost or destroyed for want of active interest). <br />For instance, I was once shown in Kerala, among many ancient texts, a <br />thick palm-leaf manuscript of a Ramayana by ... Vyasa. (Some <br />traditions do mention it, but it has been regarded as lost.) Post-<br />Independence India has been prodigiously careless in preserving its <br />cultural heritage.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://micheldanino.voiceofdharma.com/tamilculture.html">http://micheldanino.voiceofdharma.com/tamilculture.html</a><!-- m --></div>

Balasubramani,</div></blockquote>Thanks. The paper is presented in 2001. In the last 5 years, there <br />have been more details found and reported.<br /><br />Recent finds lead us to postulate :<br /><br />Tamil Brahmi might have been the Server to Asokan Brahmi - <br />postulated by Dr. Airavatham himself.<br /><br />The recent reportings on Adichnallur and Dwaraka, as Shri. TKV Rajan <br />Archelogist has been publishing, are pointers towards establishing <br />more ancient nature of Tamil Culture.<br /><br />It is also not out of place to mention that Dr. Sathiamurthy <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> <br />observed that "Chanting process " was reported in Tamil language <br />because Tamil language was already more coversant with "Writing - <br />Script" process ! This SINGLE Opinion throws enormous light on what <br />has been discussed or left undiscussed.<br /><br />It is time such Scholars showing interest in this, should take a <br />fresh look at all available materials and revisit earlier <br />assumptions,.<br /><br />The subject paper, no doubt, can definitely be a platform in this <br />direction..<br /><br />We will definitely get into the fusion of Language - Culture & <br />Religion - which may be the unifying factor all of us in our <br />Motherland !<br /><br />regards / sps</div>
