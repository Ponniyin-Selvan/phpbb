			<div class="content">Sampath, I think its time to disagree on this one for me. <br /><br />Nietzsche = Vashistar?. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I <br />remember a friend who argued that since Nietzsche rejected <br />Christianity and thrashed it to the hilt, it means that Hinduism <br />must be the real faith. It took a lot for me to explain that <br />Nietzsche not just rejected Christianity but rejected the notion of <br />God in the first place.<br /><br />Now I am seeing a post from you thrilled at the mention of manu by <br />Nietzsche. I dont understand the reason behind that. But you are <br />also mentioning that Nietzsche himself is mentioning that 'Manu is <br />based on a holy lie'. How come a book built on the premise of a holy <br />lie can be praised for the contents?. If you do not agree on the <br />premise, how can you praise the content?. <br /><br />Again, going back to the basic philosophy of Nietzsche, he builts it <br />on the premise that God was an invention by the 'priestly' class for <br />satisfying the inadequecies of the simpler men. Without the 'moral <br />values' imposed by a God, the stronger men/women will be able to <br />live in this world without suffering the lesser men. While the <br />interpretation is crude, this is what I deduced when I read 'Thus <br />spake Zaruthustra' and 'Beyond good and evil' back in college days. <br /><br />Now reading manu, under this premise, he is actually extolling him <br />for trying to visualise a society with the norms he agrees with. The <br />rulers, 'men of will', at the top with the lesser ones at the <br />bottom. The agreement with manu for Nietzsche is not as a thinker <br />appreciating a fellow thinkers thought process, but as a philosopher <br />finding supporting ground for his philosophies. Thus I find it <br />amusing that a person, whom I respect for the kind of wider <br />knowledge you've exhibited, is simply taken for a ride by a German <br />philosopher whose philosophy was used as a justification by no <br />lesser a person than Hitler (however misguided he might be) and was <br />used as a support for the holocaust ('The rise and fall of the Third <br />Reich' by Willian Shirer). While the thoughts of Manu has taken <br />shape into a birth-based caste system which is in existence till <br />today. Now explain how we can tell that manu actually intended to <br />create a society based on the 'merit' of an individual and therefore <br />we need to 'reform' the caste system to say, the guy who is is <br />humiliated every day by being served water in seperate tumblers in <br />villages? (no fiction, I saw it in a village near Ambai in <br />Tirunelveli district!). <br /><br />While agreeing that Manu and Nietzsche are great thinkers, I think <br />Nietzsche will be rolling in his grave at the thought of people <br />servile to the approval of Westerners for their own people's thought <br />processes. Its not just anti-nietzschean but tragic indeed. If you <br />want a real 'vashister' who has priased manu and his thoughts on the <br />varnashrama, why not quote Sri Chandrasekarendra <br />swamigal's 'Deivathin kural' (think available online at the kanchi <br />kamakoti site)?. That would've been close to the philosophy of <br />Nietzsche.<br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "rojatraders" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>The greatest thinker of 19th century was Fredrick Nietzsche.He <br />  created a generation of pragmatists all over europe and <br />  America.Nietzsche&#39;s disciples still rule the world of philosophy.<br />  Nietzsche&#39;s views on God is well known.He famously declared &#39;God <br />is <br />  dead&#39;.He was a world renowned atheist.Such an atheist read a hindu <br />  book and had very great opinion on that book.He sings the glory of <br />  that book in his letters.<br />  Any guesses as of what book that is?Geetha,veda,purana??-no.<br />  <br />  It&#39;s Manu.He hails it as the source of morals of entire humanity.<br />  <br />  Nietzsche says on manu as follows<br />  <br />  "It is with an opposite feeling that I read the law of Manu, an <br />  incomparably spiritual and superior work: even to mention it in <br />the <br />  same breath with the *****&#40;edited&#41; would be a sin against the <br />  spirit.

			<div class="content">Muthu prakash,<br />That was a great post on Nietzsche and his thoughts.<br /><br />Nietzsche was against god and religion.Nietzsche hated somebody else <br />controlling and determining his life.His horror was to find him as a <br />replica.he did not want to be like others.He wanted to be <br />different.Religion doesnt permit a person to be different.It makes <br />us to comply.It wants uniformity.This is what nietzsche hated.He did <br />not want to be shaped by past.Instead he wanted to do to past, what <br />it wanted to do to him.<br /><br />"My greatest horror in life is to find myself as a replica" said <br />poetess bloom.Nietzsche had the same mentality.So he started writing <br />about creating a new soul,new Europe etc.Nietzsche's important <br />contribution is a suggestion to stop asking futile philosophical <br />questions and to stop the idea of finding out 'truth'.Based on his <br />criticism of truth,new definitions for the term truth was required <br />and we had a new field called pragmatism with people like charles <br />pierce and william James contributing to its growth.<br /><br />Hitler hailed Nietzsche because he was a German.It's like madurai <br />muniyandi vilas having photo of Girubanada variyar.<br /><br />So Nietzsche certainly is equal to vasishta.Both were great <br />thinkers.Nietzsche would have accepted vasishta as a metaphysical <br />philospher in lines of plato and aristotle.Many modern day <br />pragmatists accept Indian philosphers of the old.Rorty accepts <br />shankara as a philosopher but says he doesnt know where to classify <br />him.Modern day philosphers dont reject the works of philosphers of <br />the past.They certainly have attacked the ideas of plato and <br />aristotle but they dont fail to appreciate their contribution to the <br />field of philosophy.In the field of philosophy works of previous <br />philosphers becomes fodder for todays philosophers.The field builds <br />up past work.<br /><br />So it is not surprising that Nietzsche criticized manu for the 'holy <br />lie',but still appreciated it for the deep underlying philosophy in <br />it.Nietzsche certainly would have found fault with manu the way he <br />found fault with plato's concept of morality.But he never fails to <br />appreciate whats good.Rorty has many good words to say about <br />communist manifesto and Bible.He analyzes them like any other book.<br /><br />manu,bharatha,ramayana all can be great guide to us.But they cannot <br />be the only guide.We should not hesitate to reject what is not <br />appropriate for us.We have to learn our life's principles from many <br />many books.Instead of rejecting a book in toto for whats bad in <br />it,we have to accept whats good in it.Thats what nietzsche did with <br />manu.In the end he had very high opinion on it.He did not think that <br />as work of god,but he approached it as work of man.<br /><br />regards<br />sampath<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Muthu Prakash R" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Sampath, I think its time to disagree on this one for me. <br />  <br />  Nietzsche = Vashistar?. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I <br />  remember a friend who argued that since Nietzsche rejected <br />  Christianity and thrashed it to the hilt, it means that Hinduism <br />  must be the real faith. It took a lot for me to explain that <br />  Nietzsche not just rejected Christianity but rejected the notion <br />of <br />  God in the first place.<br />  <br />  Now I am seeing a post from you thrilled at the mention of manu by <br />  Nietzsche. I dont understand the reason behind that. But you are <br />  also mentioning that Nietzsche himself is mentioning that &#39;Manu is <br />  based on a holy lie&#39;. How come a book built on the premise of a <br />holy <br />  lie can be praised for the contents?. If you do not agree on the <br />  premise, how can you praise the content?. <br />  <br />  Again, going back to the basic philosophy of Nietzsche, he builts <br />it <br />  on the premise that God was an invention by the &#39;priestly&#39; class <br />for <br />  satisfying the inadequecies of the simpler men. Without the &#39;moral <br />  values&#39; imposed by a God, the stronger men/women will be able to <br />  live in this world without suffering the lesser men. While the <br />  interpretation is crude, this is what I deduced when I read &#39;Thus <br />  spake Zaruthustra&#39; and &#39;Beyond good and evil&#39; back in college <br />days. <br />  <br />  Now reading manu, under this premise, he is actually extolling him <br />  for trying to visualise a society with the norms he agrees with. <br />The <br />  rulers, &#39;men of will&#39;, at the top with the lesser ones at the <br />  bottom. The agreement with manu for Nietzsche is not as a thinker <br />  appreciating a fellow thinkers thought process, but as a <br />philosopher <br />  finding supporting ground for his philosophies. Thus I find it <br />  amusing that a person, whom I respect for the kind of wider <br />  knowledge you&#39;ve exhibited, is simply taken for a ride by a German <br />  philosopher whose philosophy was used as a justification by no <br />  lesser a person than Hitler &#40;however misguided he might be&#41; and <br />was <br />  used as a support for the holocaust &#40;&#39;The rise and fall of the <br />Third <br />  Reich&#39; by Willian Shirer&#41;. While the thoughts of Manu has taken <br />  shape into a birth-based caste system which is in existence till <br />  today. Now explain how we can tell that manu actually intended to <br />  create a society based on the &#39;merit&#39; of an individual and <br />therefore <br />  we need to &#39;reform&#39; the caste system to say, the guy who is is <br />  humiliated every day by being served water in seperate tumblers in <br />  villages? &#40;no fiction, I saw it in a village near Ambai in <br />  Tirunelveli district!&#41;. <br />  <br />  While agreeing that Manu and Nietzsche are great thinkers, I think <br />  Nietzsche will be rolling in his grave at the thought of people <br />  servile to the approval of Westerners for their own people&#39;s <br />thought <br />  processes. Its not just anti-nietzschean but tragic indeed. If you <br />  want a real &#39;vashister&#39; who has priased manu and his thoughts on <br />the <br />  varnashrama, why not quote Sri Chandrasekarendra <br />  swamigal&#39;s &#39;Deivathin kural&#39; &#40;think available online at the kanchi <br />  kamakoti site&#41;?. That would&#39;ve been close to the philosophy of <br />  Nietzsche.<br />  <br />  Muthu Prakash R<br />  <br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "rojatraders" <br />   wrote:<br />    The greatest thinker of 19th century was Fredrick Nietzsche.He <br />    created a generation of pragmatists all over europe and <br />    America.Nietzsche&#39;s disciples still rule the world of philosophy.<br />    Nietzsche&#39;s views on God is well known.He famously declared &#39;God <br />  is <br />    dead&#39;.He was a world renowned atheist.Such an atheist read a <br />hindu <br />    book and had very great opinion on that book.He sings the glory <br />of <br />    that book in his letters.<br />    Any guesses as of what book that is?Geetha,veda,purana??-no.<br />    <br />    It&#39;s Manu.He hails it as the source of morals of entire humanity.<br />    <br />    Nietzsche says on manu as follows<br />    <br />    "It is with an opposite feeling that I read the law of Manu, an <br />    incomparably spiritual and superior work: even to mention it in <br />  the <br />    same breath with the *****&#40;edited&#41; would be a sin against the <br />    spirit.
