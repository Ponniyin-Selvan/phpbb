In the mid-eleventh century, <br />the <br />  Chola king Rajadhiraja defeated the Chalukyas and plundered <br />Kalyani, <br />  taking a large black stone door guardian to his capital in <br />  Thanjavur, where it was displayed to his subjects as a trophy of <br />war <br />  &#40;see Figure 5&#41;. "<br />  <br />  I am also trying to find the referred article below<br />  <br />  Buddhist literature from Sri Lanka says that the Indian king took <br />  advantage of an internal strife in Sri Lanka and invaded the <br />island. <br />  The ruthless Chola conquest was apparently no different from the <br />  conduct of Mahmud of Ghazni at Somnath. The Kulavamsa says that <br />the <br />  capital Anuradhapura, which sported many Buddhist viharas, <br />  was &#39;utterly destroyed in every way by the Chola army.&#39; Not only <br />  were the viharas decimated, but the holy stupas in them were torn <br />  apart in search of treasure. As George W. Spencer observes in The <br />  Politics of Expansion: The Chola Conquest of Sri Lanka and Sri <br />  Vijaya, &#39;Even if we allow for the exaggeration of the chroniclers, <br />  it is clear that the Cholas devastated the city.&#39; " <br />  <br />  <br />  rgds<br />  vj<br />  ===============================</div></blockquote>Dear Vj,<br /><br />For the sake of recollection :<br /><br />1.

			<div class="content">check out this site <br /><br />THE MEDIAEVAL KINODOM TO THE CHOLA CONQUEST <br /><br />IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY <br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap03.html">http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap03.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Kassapa V. (ninth-tenth century), born of the twice crowned queen' <br />Sangha, was the son of Sena II., and was made sub-king at his birth. <br />He was a man of learning, and wrote a Sinhala paraphrase of the <br />Dhammapada which still survives. In his reign the Pandyan king <br />Rajasinha unwisely made war on the Cholas, sad being routed asked <br />for Kassapa's help. The Sinhala king thereupon sent an army, which <br />returned to Lanka unsuccessful. He died according to the Mahavamsa <br />in his tenth year His successor, Dappula IV. only ruled for a few <br />months, and Dappula V. (early tenth century) had hardly come to the <br />throne when the Pandyan king arrived in Lanka, flying from the <br />Cholas. The Sinhala monarch was preparing to give him help when a <br />sudden strife arose among the princes of the Island, and the Pandyan <br />had to retire to Malabar disappointed, leaving, however, his crown <br />and royal ornaments with the king of Lanka. The war between the <br />Pandyans and Cholas seems to have taken place at the end of the <br />reign of Kassapa V and at the beginning of that of Dappula V.; the <br />invasion of Rajasinha and the king of Lanka actually is mentioned in <br />a record of the Chola king Parantaka I. (A.D. 907-953) dated in his <br />twelfth year, or A.D. 918/9. We see here the rise of the great Chola <br />Empire, which first overshadowed and finally engulfed the Island <br />kingdom. <br /><br />After Udaya II. and Sena III. the Sinhala throne was occupied by <br />Udaya III., who was `a drunkard and a sluggard.' Parantaka took <br />advantage of this, and sent an embassy for the Pandyan regalia left <br />in Lanka in the time of Dappula V. His demand being refused, he <br />invaded the Island, Udaya flying with the disputed regalia towards <br />Ruhuna, which the Chola army did not succeed in entering. The enemy <br />then `returned to their own country, leaving the Island in great <br />fear,' and Udaya took reprisals by destroying `the borders of the <br />dominion of the king of Chola.' Parantaka's power was broken by the <br />Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. about A.D. 942 /3,. and it seems <br />likely that this was the cause of the Chola retreat and the counter-<br />invasion of the Sinhala. Udaya died in his eighth year, while <br />rebuilding a palace burnt by the Cholas. <br /><br />Udaya's second successor was his nephew Mahinda IV. (middle of tenth <br />century). He departed from former custom by marrying a princess of <br />the ruling family of Kalinga, which in the twelfth century gave a <br />dynasty to the Island. Before his ninth year, Lanka was attacked by <br />King Vallabha, apparently the Chola king Parantaka II., whose <br />general was slain in Lanka about A.D. 959. The enemy army landed at <br />Uratota (Kayts). This was the last success of the Sinhala for many a <br />long year, as Mahinda's son Sena V. foolishly murdered his general's <br />brother, and the enraged officer took his revenge by assembling <br />together the Tamils settled in Lanka and making over the country to <br />them. This took place in the second year of the reign. The Tamils so <br />oppressed the people that Sena made his peace with the general and <br />returned to Polonnaruwa. Here, however, becoming addicted to strong <br />drink, and `like unto a mad tiger,' he died while still young, in <br />the tenth year of his reign, and was succeeded by his brother <br />Mahinda V. or Udaya (tenth-eleventh century). <br /><br />Fig 3.1Mediaval Gold Coin.  <br /><br /><br />The new king reigned at Anuradhapura but governed with difficulty, <br />as the city was full of foreigners introduced by his late brother's <br />general. In his twelfth year the revenue was withheld and the king <br />was unable to pay his Malabar mercenaries, who mutinied. Mahinda <br />thereupon fled to Ruhuna. leaving the country in the hands of the <br />Malabars, Sinhala and Canarese. The opportunity was too good to be <br />lost, and at some date between A.D. 1001/2 and 1004/5 the great <br />Chola emperor Rajaraja I. (A.D. 985-101.2) conquered all the <br />country, save the remoter parts which were still held by the <br />Sinhala. The conquest was completed about A.D. 10 17 by the capture <br />of Mahinda V. himself with his crown jewels and the Pandyan regalia <br />left by Rajasinha. Lanka became a province of the Chola empire and <br />Polonnaruwa was renamed Jananatha pura. It was at this period that <br />miny of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected. Mahinda V. died <br />in captivity in India.</div>

ESSENCE ..<br /><br />regards / sps<br /><br />=====================<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Kassapa V. &#40;ninth-tenth century&#41;, born of the twice crowned queen&#39; <br />  Sangha, was the son of Sena II., and was made sub-king at his <br />birth. <br />  He was a man of learning, and wrote a Sinhala paraphrase of the <br />  Dhammapada which still survives. In his reign the Pandyan king <br />  Rajasinha unwisely made war on the Cholas, sad being routed asked <br />  for Kassapa&#39;s help. The Sinhala king thereupon sent an army, which <br />  returned to Lanka unsuccessful. He died according to the Mahavamsa <br />  in his tenth year His successor, Dappula IV. only ruled for a few <br />  months, and Dappula V. &#40;early tenth century&#41; had hardly come to <br />the <br />  throne when the Pandyan king arrived in Lanka, flying from the <br />  Cholas. The Sinhala monarch was preparing to give him help when a <br />  sudden strife arose among the princes of the Island, and the <br />Pandyan <br />  had to retire to Malabar disappointed, leaving, however, his crown <br />  and royal ornaments with the king of Lanka. The war between the <br />  Pandyans and Cholas seems to have taken place at the end of the <br />  reign of Kassapa V and at the beginning of that of Dappula V.; the <br />  invasion of Rajasinha and the king of Lanka actually is mentioned <br />in <br />  a record of the Chola king Parantaka I. &#40;A.D. 907-953&#41; dated in <br />his <br />  twelfth year, or A.D. 918/9. We see here the rise of the great <br />Chola <br />  Empire, which first overshadowed and finally engulfed the Island <br />  kingdom. <br />  <br />  After Udaya II. and Sena III. the Sinhala throne was occupied by <br />  Udaya III., who was `a drunkard and a sluggard.&#39; Parantaka took <br />  advantage of this, and sent an embassy for the Pandyan regalia <br />left <br />  in Lanka in the time of Dappula V. His demand being refused, he <br />  invaded the Island, Udaya flying with the disputed regalia towards <br />  Ruhuna, which the Chola army did not succeed in entering. The <br />enemy <br />  then `returned to their own country, leaving the Island in great <br />  fear,&#39; and Udaya took reprisals by destroying `the borders of the <br />  dominion of the king of Chola.&#39; Parantaka&#39;s power was broken by <br />the <br />  Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. about A.D. 942 /3,. and it seems <br />  likely that this was the cause of the Chola retreat and the <br />counter-<br />  invasion of the Sinhala. Udaya died in his eighth year, while <br />  rebuilding a palace burnt by the Cholas. <br />  <br />  Udaya&#39;s second successor was his nephew Mahinda IV. &#40;middle of <br />tenth <br />  century&#41;. He departed from former custom by marrying a princess of <br />  the ruling family of Kalinga, which in the twelfth century gave a <br />  dynasty to the Island. Before his ninth year, Lanka was attacked <br />by <br />  King Vallabha, apparently the Chola king Parantaka II., whose <br />  general was slain in Lanka about A.D. 959. The enemy army landed <br />at <br />  Uratota &#40;Kayts&#41;. This was the last success of the Sinhala for many <br />a <br />  long year, as Mahinda&#39;s son Sena V. foolishly murdered his <br />general&#39;s <br />  brother, and the enraged officer took his revenge by assembling <br />  together the Tamils settled in Lanka and making over the country <br />to <br />  them. This took place in the second year of the reign. The Tamils <br />so <br />  oppressed the people that Sena made his peace with the general and <br />  returned to Polonnaruwa. Here, however, becoming addicted to <br />strong <br />  drink, and `like unto a mad tiger,&#39; he died while still young, in <br />  the tenth year of his reign, and was succeeded by his brother <br />  Mahinda V. or Udaya &#40;tenth-eleventh century&#41;. <br />  <br />  Fig 3.1Mediaval Gold Coin.  <br />  <br />  <br />  The new king reigned at Anuradhapura but governed with difficulty, <br />  as the city was full of foreigners introduced by his late <br />brother&#39;s <br />  general. In his twelfth year the revenue was withheld and the king <br />  was unable to pay his Malabar mercenaries, who mutinied. Mahinda <br />  thereupon fled to Ruhuna. leaving the country in the hands of the <br />  Malabars, Sinhala and Canarese. The opportunity was too good to be <br />  lost, and at some date between A.D. 1001/2 and 1004/5 the great <br />  Chola emperor Rajaraja I. &#40;A.D. 985-101.2&#41; conquered all the <br />  country, save the remoter parts which were still held by the <br />  Sinhala. The conquest was completed about A.D. 10 17 by the <br />capture <br />  of Mahinda V. himself with his crown jewels and the Pandyan <br />regalia <br />  left by Rajasinha. Lanka became a province of the Chola empire and <br />  Polonnaruwa was renamed Jananatha pura. It was at this period that <br />  miny of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected. Mahinda V. <br />died <br />  in captivity in India.</div></blockquote></div>

AGAIN !<br /> <br />  On 8th July 2002, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sv24in"<br />   wrote:<br /> <br />  Who is Nandini?<br /> <br />  When Ram &#40;our moderator&#41; approached me for a weekly article based<br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how<br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to<br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while<br />  we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"<br /> <br />  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by<br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the<br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we<br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new<br />  secret about her life.<br /> <br />  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images<br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery<br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history.<br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she<br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After<br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s story we are prepared to meet a<br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but<br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be<br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she<br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br /> <br />  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her<br />  beauty with that of Kundavai&#39;s than through a man&#39;s eyes! But it is<br />  certain that Nandini&#39;s magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the<br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her<br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick<br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava<br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is<br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br /> <br />  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan<br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini&#39;s dangerous web.<br /> <br />  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the<br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the<br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies<br />  who want avenge their king&#39;s death.<br /> <br />  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic<br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an<br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br /> <br />  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure<br />  that she is Mandakini&#39;s daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br /> <br />  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion<br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after<br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br /> <br />  The crux of the problem is Mandakini&#39;s loss of memory. Karuthiruman<br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her<br />  emory<br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br /> <br />  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the<br />  Pandya King&#39;s message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall<br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?<br /> <br />  Now let&#39;s discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan.<br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani,<br />  Mandakini&#39;s twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of<br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not<br />  recognize him?<br /> <br />  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two<br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends<br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi<br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that<br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back.<br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not<br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the<br />  lighthouse and her last accident.<br /> <br />  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her?<br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles<br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we<br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly<br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like<br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has<br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to<br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind<br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had<br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love<br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out<br />  what happened to her.<br /> <br />  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to<br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman<br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan&#39;s children are being brought up in<br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the<br />king<br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that<br />  she was pregnant but doesn&#39;t know what happened to the babies or to<br />  their mother.<br /> <br />  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the<br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. &#40;Ref:<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1&amp;#41;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyins ... age/1&amp;#41;</a><!-- m --> That is<br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22<br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini.<br />  Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan&#39;s<br />  daughter.<br /> <br />  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of<br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the<br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must<br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he<br />  starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some<br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is<br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br /> <br />  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of<br />  Nandini&#39;s friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to<br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and<br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn&#39;t want anybody<br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.<br /> <br />  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes<br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini&#39;s<br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the<br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at<br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by<br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was<br />  her father?<br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan&#39;s reaction when he saw Nandini?<br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that<br />  Nandini&#39;s mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have<br />  told her so as well.<br /> <br />  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the<br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she<br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram&#39;s query. If she had<br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her<br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any<br />  logic!<br /> <br />  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him<br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she<br />  needn&#39;t have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had<br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and<br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a<br />  mad rage.<br /> <br />  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She<br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her<br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in<br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br /> <br />  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have<br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even<br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters<br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br /> <br />  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan&#39;s<br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan<br />  the way she did.<br /> <br />  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to<br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini&#39;s true love.<br /> <br />  ---------------------------<br />  Thank you very much for such a wonderful analysis .. !<br /> <br />  are you watching mails still ?<br /> <br />  awaiting your postings.<br /> <br />  regards / sps<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  No need to miss a message.

			<div class="content">Vanakkam Nanbargaley,<br /><br />Though we had discussed a lot on this topic, i have a small doubt.<br />Please don't mistake me. My doubt is - <br /><br />"Is Nandini, a fictional character or Real character who lived in<br />those time? if she is real, what proofs we have for it?"<br /><br />This may appear like a question from a ignorant, which is quiet true,<br />but i would like to have a clear answer, that could help me get out of<br />the ignorance.<br /><br />Nandrigaludan,<br />Amar</div>
