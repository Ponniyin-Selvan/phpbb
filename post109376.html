(This seems to be one of those long 10-mark essay questions)<br />Rishi Dhurvaasa who was famous for his anger and "Pidi Shaapam" <br />temperament.<br />Duryodhana sent him to the Ashram of Paandavas during Vana vaasam. <br />When he went Draupadi had already finished serving food for <br />everybody and washed the Akshaya Paathram (the divine vessel given <br />to her by Lord Surya - it will grant any and every food item without <br />any shortage - "A-Kshaya = never waning" - but one condition - it <br />will work only until Draupadi finishes serving food for the day and <br />washes it). So serving food for Rishi Dhurvaasa was difficult - but <br />refusing was far more dangerous, knowing his reputation for cursing. <br />Dhurvaasa Rishi went to take bath before meals. Meanwhile Draupadi <br />thought of her usual saviour (who else but today's Birthday boy - <br />Shri Krishna). Krishna came, heard the story and asked her to bring <br />the Akshaya Paathram. He found one grain of rice stuck to the vessel <br />(some versions talk about a green leaf ('Keerai') as well). He took <br />the grain, said "May the Almighty be satisfied with this" and ate <br />it. And as the Almighty Himself had said this and ate the grain, the <br />hunger of the whole universe got satiated, including Dhurvaasa, who <br />was bathing. Now Rishi Dhurvaasa felt that he can not eat any more. <br />So to avoid an embarassment, he left the place without coming back <br />to the Paandava's Ashram.<br /><br />4. Sairanthari (am not sure of the spelling)<br />5. (1) Keechaka at Viratapuram - killed by Bheema<br />(2) Jayadratha during Vana vaasam - she is alone in the Ashram <br />and she defends herself. Later the Paandavas search for Jayadratha, <br />Arjuna captures him and humiliates him. He is let off on Draupadi's <br />pardon. (To avenge, Jayadratha gets a boon from Shiva to have the <br />ability to stop all Paandavas other than Arjuna and so happened the <br />Abhimanyu episode and the subsequent revenge in the war).<br />6.

			<div class="content">I really liked Palace of Illusions although I felt the author could have well avoided the fictional Karna-Draupadi romance. She does a reasonably goodjob with describing the horrors of the war, Sri Krishna's character and Yudhistir. Chitra's Draupadi seems very materialistic though in comparison tothe Draupadi of the Mahabharat. But the novel is definitely a page turner and does come across as a respectful tribute to the original.<br />Â <br />Muthu, is there an english translation available of Yajnaseni? I must definitely read MTV's second turn, thanks for the reference.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Wed, 8/27/08, Muthu Prakash R  wrote: <br /><br />From: Muthu Prakash R <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Quiz on Draupadi<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Wednesday, August 27, 2008, 6:22 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi<br /><br />Good to read about Draupadi.

			<div class="content">Dear Pavithra, meet one other sucker!! It is a pity so little has actually been written around the characters of the Mahabharat, it is such a fertile readymade ground of characters that any novelist can build upon!!<br />Â <br />Yes there are folk stories that relate Karna and Draupadi. Personally I found it contrived, if a woman is married to 5 brothers she is attracted to the sixth, dont know if am saying it right but something on those lines. And Draupadi and Arjuna were really in love, not like what she says, and Arjunavery much resented the marriage between brothers.<br />Â <br />I felt same as you did that Chitra's Draupadi did not seem to understand basic human emotions.But then very generally speaking most spoilt/indulged children are like that so perhaps the author thought she was too. I did like Shikandi, as you said, although the Shikandi of the Mahabharat is a eunuch,not a man like she describes. I felt the interaction with Krishna and Draupadi seemed very childish at times, as also her attachment to him - again lots of opportunistic love. Also the author seemed very confused on whether to portray Krishna as human or divine or some mix that makes sense to the reader. Granted it is not an easy decision to make for a writer. <br />Â <br />Chitra has done a great job compared to Ashok Banker or other writers who use epics to derive some trashy output. Atleast her work reflects respect for the epic and not a huge deviance from original.

			<div class="content">I read Yajnaseni in English (yet to learn Oriya!) and think is <br />published by Rupa books and I remember buying it in Landmark, <br />Chennai 3-4 years back. 'The second turn' is a NBT publication as <br />part of the Indian classic series. Should be available in any NBT <br />shop/stall. <br /><br />That said, I find Draupadi to be the most interesting character in <br />Mahabharatha and unfortunately, not many people have taken the pains <br />to study her part. Surprisingly the only books I could find were the <br />ones by Prathibha and as you've mentioned Chitra devi. There is a <br />story by Mahashweta Devi on Draupadi but its more allegory and not <br />the historical tale. Ofcourse, close to heart lies the <br />Bharathi's 'Panchali sabatham'.<br /><br />There is a cult for Draupadi in the south and Draupadi Amman is <br />widely worshipped and praised. She is also equally reviled for her <br />decisions (especially one to cleanse her hair with the blood of the <br />Gauravas). Like someone said, we either damn our females or worship <br />them, never give them the mortal status. Thus being a very modern <br />herione of a great epic, we are worried about treating her like a <br />women who went through a lot of pain and probably followed her <br />dharma to take revenge. <br /><br />In Yajnaseni, there is a strong reference to the 'longing' for Karna <br />as well. Karna is the first who comes to hit the fish during the <br />swayamwara but is rejected due to his caste. The mournful aspect of <br />the rejection of Karna which leads to him despising her and the <br />guilt she feels for that is given the prime reason for <br />the 'infatuation' towards Karna. I dont find it contrived precisely <br />because love is a complex phenomenon and the manifestation of it <br />varies with person (ie with your GF, wife or son etc). While <br />Draupadi's love for Krishna is spritual, for Karna it manifests as a <br />tragic longing. Its just this complexity that makes Draupadi hard to <br />classify into a box. <br /><br />On the other hand, she also shows herself as a vengeful, <br />manipulative women when she entices Bheema to kill Keechaka or the <br />way she takes the revenge on the Gauravas. She is a difficult woman <br />to classify as a romantic idol or a vengeful bitch. She is both and <br />more than that. She is a great heroine who never chose anything in <br />her life as everything was thrusted on her first by her father, then <br />by her husbands and even Krishna uses her as bait. When she dies, <br />only Bheema stays with her and everyone else leaves. <br /><br />Her complexity and character is unmatched in literary world or the <br />physical world. I have read quite a few books and I am yet to find <br />another who can match her in terms of the depth of the character or <br />the tragic sense she brings into the world as a woman. <br /><br />Muthu Prakash R<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Pavithra, meet one other sucker!!

			<div class="content">Dear Malathi,<br /><br />Its been quite a while since I met someone so interested (and knowledgeable)<br />on the subject as you are <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've always wanted to believe that Arjuna did resent the others coming in -<br />instead of the general washed up view that's shared in folklore (the way I<br />heard it, anyway), that everything was hunky-dory between the others. As for<br />Krishna - its very difficult, predicting what that one might have thought<br /><img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I have, however wondered about Draupadi's motivations in leaving for the<br />forest with her husbands. I wonder what her reasons were, and judging by the<br />fiery woman she seems to have been, I hardly dare believe that pathi-bhakthi<br />was what set her off after them. What do you think?<br /><br />Hi Muthu,<br /><br />What you say about Draupadi is very true - especially the part about her not<br />being able to choose anything. But then, I've wondered if perhaps the women<br />who are reviled most in their lifetime are the ones universally worshipped<br />after their deaths - that applies to her as well. I can understand her fury<br />wanting to cleanse her hair in blood - thus, as they say, bringing about a<br />whole war, but to lay everything at her feet is a tad too much, right?<br /><br />Perhaps what she really wanted (as many women do) was just to be<br />acknowledged as someone important, whose opinions mattered - despite her<br />so-called spirit, she was still only someone who'd married five men (gasp!)<br />which made a freak. To live your life knowing everyone dissected your<br />personal life every single moment can be a torment. No woman deserves a life<br />like that.<br /><br />Cheers, P.<br /><br />--<br />My Blogs: <br /><br />English: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pavithra.rediffblogs.com">http://pavithra.rediffblogs.com</a><!-- m --><br />Thamizh: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pavithra.blogspot.com">http://pavithra.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />Travelogues (Thamizh): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pavithra.blogdrive.com">http://pavithra.blogdrive.com</a><!-- m --><br />(English): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://historicaljourneys.blogspot.com">http://historicaljourneys.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br />Sivagamiyin Sabadham (translation): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sivagamiyin-sabadham.blogspot.com">http://sivagamiyin-sabadham.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Proud 2B An Epic Indian!<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.epicindia.com">http://www.epicindia.com</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Malathi,<br />I found ' Palace of Illusions ' very tedious, did finish it, but was<br />so glad<br />that it wasn't my introduction to the MBh.<br />I might never have become fascinated by it.<br />She played favorites among the Pandavas<br />&, I thought, didn't transmit all the subtle shades of grey<br />of the characters.
