			<div class="content">Well said MrVenketesh. It is not possible for kings to conquer without<br />destroying and looting.

Manidha neyam<br /><br />We are talking about looting and it is justified as way of relief <br />for soldiers. Narasimma pallavan's army looted vatapi. Adhitha <br />karikalan's army looted madurai. Rajendran's and his sons' armies <br />looted north india. But, in case of Rajaraja, there was only one <br />looting. Udhakai. The title given by later period poets 'Udhakai <br />thee uyththa uravon' has no place in his meikeerthi. The udhakai <br />invasion was not for capturing. It is just for punishing the king <br />who got deviated from norms. You can compare Rajendra and his sons' <br />meikeerthi with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s. While other meikeerthi talks about their <br />lootings and 'nose-cuts', 'Thirumagal pola' poetically lists the <br />victories chronologically. This means he never encouraged lootings. <br />Even the 'paramparai' enemies pandyas and sinhalese are mentioned <br />without any insulting intention. 'Murattezhil singalavar' <br />and 'Chezhiyarai dhesu kol'. How can core enemies be addressed more <br />honorific than this? Not only the 'hollywood speeches' recharge the <br />soldiers. Dedicating victory to soldiers would also cheer them up!<br /><br />2. King lived for people<br /><br />The vallam inscriptions talk about a village administrative officer <br />who met the emperor. Most of you may know this already. But i am <br />explaining here just for compiling <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s merits. The VAO met <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and <br />asked for 'nivandham' to light lamp in his village for the king to <br />live long and give 'nallaatchi'. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> replied that people are the <br />backbone of government and asked him to light the lamp in the name <br />of village people instead of the king and donated some money and <br />goats. After returning to his village, the VAO started lighting 2 <br />lamps in the name of king as well as village people. Out of his busy <br />schedule of continuous wars and massive temple constructions, he <br />thought about people and their welfare.<br /><br />3. Distributed power centers<br /><br />This is the wonder of democracy in monocracy. India is such a large <br />country, which cannot be ruled by a single person. I think this is <br />what Rajendra and his sons failed to understand which lead to <br />decline of chola dynasty. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was well aware of this. So, he <br />surveyed the entire kingdom, splitted into many divisions and <br />appointed administrative officers on rotation basis. Defined set of <br />norms for each department. Scandals and bribes were found <br />immediately by excellent spy network. Defaulters were punished <br />without any exception. Even when an officer takes leave or retires <br />or dies, the method to choose the person to take in-charge was also <br />well drafted. Well planned administration. 'Nivandhams' were closely <br />watched and revoked when misused. Administration of akbar can come <br />only next to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /><br />4. Peridhinum peridhu kEl<br /><br />He may be ambitious and egoist. But nobody is better example for <br />Bharathi's 'Peridhinum peridhu kel' and Abdul kalam's 'Kanavu <br />kaanungal' than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. He dreamt big. We got the wonderful temple. <br />When we were sitting next to the kalasam, we became speechless and <br />breatheless. Not because of height. Even the 1000 feet Tokyo tower <br />didnÃ¢Â€Â™t give this much impact in my mind. That time everyone thought <br />the same, but couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t share with others. Just understood by seeing <br />others' faces. We feel great just by climbing to the top. But he <br />dreamt, planned and executed. He is the man who achieved this. How <br />would have he felt? Nobody can imagine. Though i am not 100% sure, I <br />think that was the tallest building in the world at that time, when <br />the citizens of present day developed nation were barbarians. Slaves <br />might have been used for bringing stones from various places. But <br />without giving due respect and attention to sculptures and <br />architects, such wonder wouldn't have been possible at all. The <br />saying 'Kasaiyadi koduthu kavidhai vaanga mudiyaathu' perfectly fits <br />for all forms of art. The modern management principle 'Unless the <br />leader is dedicated and gives importance to his duty, the <br />productivity of people working under him cannot be high' holds good <br />for the case of building such architectural wonder also.<br /><br />5. Right to get information<br /><br />Right from his meikeerthi to his last reginal year inscription in <br />periya koyil, it is evident that he wanted to give transparent <br />administration which was less in the period of other kings. <br />Inscriptions and copper plates play major role in drafting history. <br />For whom these inscriptions are useful? Only for historians and <br />people like us who are interested in history? This was the way to <br />announce happenings in kingdom to common people and inscribed where <br />people assemble frequently. Though major portion of inscriptions <br />talk about grants, the historical facts are hidden in that. Let me <br />give an example. Today, when we register a sale of house, we mention <br />the location of that house by providing the details of each <br />neighbour. If we collect all the sale deeds of that village from <br />registrar office, we can find out who was living in which house and <br />when. That is how history is filtered from various inscriptions. One <br />of the rare social inscriptions 'Thalichery kalvettu' exclusively <br />talks about the details of allotment of houses to ladies who <br />involved in activities of big temple. As far as i know, there is no <br />such detailed inscription by any other king.<br /><br />6. Selflessness<br /><br />He never owned any pride by himself alone. Let it be the victory in <br />wars or grants to temples. Grants of everyone for temples he built <br />is documented in excellent way. Not only big temple. Thiruvalanjuzhi <br />is also another feather in his crown. Even the grant of golden <br />flowers by maid of queen. Imagine if a maid of queen can donate some <br />golden flowers, how would have been the economy of the kingdom. <br />Sometimes back, there was a discussion about increasing tax for <br />building temples. That wouldn't have happened in case of big temple. <br />If the temple was built from people's money, then why should the <br />king and common people donate separately and they are documented?<br /><br />The last point is, about the available information on other kings of <br />india. I agree that we should not underrate a king just because of <br />not having any record. But only if we have proper evidences, we can <br />say it as a fact. Otherwise, it would be mere fiction. Those <br />assumptions cannot come under history. As of now, we have enough <br />evidences to prove <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as 'The Greatest' king of India. The validity <br />period of this conclusion expires when another king is proved <br />as 'The Greatest' with proper evidences.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Kamal</div>

I was afraid that people may skip my mail <br />because of its length.<br /><br />Out of 6 points, only the first one talks about meikeerthi. So far, <br />we haven't come across any evidence stating that meikeerthi was sung <br />before the king every day. OK. For the sake of argument, let us <br />assume that meikeerthi was sung before the king daily and <br />possess 'Uyarvu navirchi ani'. It should have been sung before <br />Rajendra and his descendants also, right?

			<div class="content">-Dear Kamal<br /><br />if we were all not fans of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> we wouldnt be here in the first place.<br /><br />he was a phenomenal man , one who has left his mark a millenium hence.<br /><br /><br />but the point as I said is we should attempt to derive a real <br />charecter map of him<br /><br />In fact its mainly because of kalki that we dont get a real picture of <br />the real <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.it is the image shri. krinamurthy left us which is <br />preventing us.<br />reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> ,I still imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> with a baby face and large biceps( <br />that itself is a paradox)<br /><br />I am not doubting his meikeerthi at all. because we know when he died <br />he was literally undefeated.<br /><br />but how good was he during the conquests. once again shri krinamurthy <br />clouds our understanding. he goes out of the way to say grains were <br />sent for the invading chola army in lanka. if they were so good why <br />conquer at all.<br /><br />should we only depend on the chola version for his life on the <br />warfield. or should we not make a search for contradicting accounts <br />from the opposite side too?<br /><br />my simple point is history should not be written by the victors alone.<br /><br /><br />regards<br />venketesh</div>

			<div class="content">Actually I wanted argue for Kuloththungan-1 as a greatest King we have seen in Tamilnadu History because he, the only King ruled under centralised system from Godavari south bank to Ceylon and also It was the country that time was the biggest (and also Hindu kingdom) over other kingdoms in India. And no doubt, he was a real emperor in his times like Samudra Gupta or Akbar.<br /><br />But Kamal's valuable points have changed my perception. KL has equalant qualities what <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> possess, but lacking in democratic process. Though he started the initiative for an independent ruling system in Madurai, he has not allowed the same in his paternal kingdom in Vengi and Ceylon where he appointed his own people as representative of him (like present day governors). <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> did not do this in Vengi and Celon.. He has handled the Vengi and Celon matters very very cleverly and this particular rajathandram is still valid. Here <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> scored over KL.<br /><br />At the same time, we could not blame KL for his handling of Vengi matters too because he wanted this country to be included as part of Tamilnadu. Had he succeeded in that effort, the coastal belt of present Andhra Pradesh would have been a pure Tamil country like Thondai mandalam. He has even sent quite a number of Tamil population during his period to settle in godavari and krishna districts.
