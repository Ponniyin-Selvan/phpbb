			<div class="content">hi friends,<br />i feel that manimegalai's love for vanthiya thevan is greater than anyone's love .. she was ready to scarifice anything for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>.. without seeing <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> she started loving him.. the heart mainmegalai is greatly portrayed by kalki...<br />she was even ready to accept that she killed <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>when vanthiya thevan was blamed... while kunthavi dint even go and see <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> in prison...<br />at any instance we cant say that love of kunthavai is greater than manimegalai's..... kunthavai's love is full expectations...<br />but mainmegalai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> is a true love without any expectations..<br />a love should be like that.... i think u ppl must 've come accrosed the qoute in tamil "NEE ENAI KATHALITHALUM KATHILIKAVITTALUM NAAN UNNAI KATHALIPEAN".. so i feel that mainimegalai's love is greatest..<br /><br />cheers,<br />bhuvana.<br /><br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote: <br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote: <br /><br />Question<br /><br />1) Is the Chola King name specified in the inscription ?<br />2) Who wrote it and why - meaning people write about their<br />achievement understandable, but do people write about their defeat<br />or suffering to be displayed.<br />The intent is very important.<br /><br />i dont have the actual epigraphica india volume ( think volume<br />II)..<br />------------------------------<br />Dear Friends,<br /><br />With the beginning of a New Year, why not we look at earlier mails<br />and open discussions on LOVE of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> RELATED CHARACTERS than Wars ..<br /><br />Silent members are invited to mail their views ..<br /><br />Following message for reposted as a subject to begin with.<br /><br />anbudan / sps<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />WHOSE LOVE WAS THE GREATEST :: MESSAGE :: 288 :: REPOSTED.<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ramaswami, Srividya"<br /> wrote : <br /><br />Hi --<br /><br />* Kundhavai's Love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br /><br />Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she was conscious of<br />what she was giving and what she was getting. But as a princess, she<br />has to be. When taking kundhavai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a<br />lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought up<br />in such a set up, actually,<br />falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you<br />look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and<br />helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be<br />because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love with<br />a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn't<br />have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th<br />bagam if I am right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything<br />else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable of<br />giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty<br />clear.<br /><br />* Vanathi's love for AM<br /><br />She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have to<br />keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love<br />and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his patta<br />magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people<br />like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br /><br />* Manimekalai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br /><br />As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in<br />love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she<br />loves her brother so much and this friendship between them (<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and<br />her brother) has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In the<br />end too, its because she<br />realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is wrong<br />that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation<br />where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother is<br />giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something else.<br />And in the end, everything<br />goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its<br />fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with<br />the love she has for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has<br />done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way she<br />did. That's not in her character.<br /><br />* Nandini's love for KK<br /><br />Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example<br />of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants<br />as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of that<br />moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not<br />clear. All she wants is power. In<br />the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she does<br />fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a<br />scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and<br />reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people<br />including Ravidasan.<br /><br />* Mandhakini's love for SC<br /><br />She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost his<br />way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that's<br />another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried saving<br />this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses memory<br />of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and<br />disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is<br />predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no life<br />of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her<br />extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life in<br />the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary<br />character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not can<br />you compare her love with anyone's for as I said, she did not live<br />her life for herself. Her life was<br />dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br /><br />* Poonguzhali's love for AM<br /><br />This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She realized<br />that there was no point in going ahead with something that would<br />never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to<br />acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. And<br />that was a wise decision both for<br />herself and for AM.<br /><br /><br />Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say<br />it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And<br />she died in the process of saving his life.<br /><br />But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give<br />(she too has plans for her life) and she is deciding things<br />accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is an<br />individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what she<br />can give. She is not interested in going<br />about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste her<br />time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own<br />life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your<br />beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai<br />second.<br /><br />I don't know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain Head<br />by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a<br />particular place, that unless you know the meaning of 'I' in 'I love<br />you' you cannot understand what it actually means to love another<br />person. That way, I feel both<br />Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the 'I' well and<br />emphatically.<br /><br />To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and both<br />you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love.<br />That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were<br />Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in return<br />for their love. They are happy and<br />they make their loved ones happy too.<br /><br />My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />thanks,<br />Vidya.<br /><br />==============<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>-----Original Message-----<br />  From: Sridhar Rathinam [ <br />mailto:sridhar_rathinam@...]<br />  Sent: Friday, October 18, 2002 12:41 AM<br />  To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br /> <br /> <br />  There has been too much of a silence lately..just to<br />rekindle..who&#39;s<br />  love was the greatest?<br /> <br />  Kundavai&#39;s love which was ready to forsake everything for a Nadodi<br />  Vandhiyadevan....&#40;Ayya indakaram patriya naan innoruvar karam<br />  pattramatten..&#41;<br /> <br />  Vanathi&#39;s love for Arunmozhi...which was ready to forsake the<br />throne<br />  of a great empire just for his love....Vanathiyin Sabatham<br /> <br />  Mandakini&#39;s love for Sundaracholar...Looking after the heirs of her<br />  beloved who left her and ending up giving her life to save him.<br /> <br />  Manimekalai&#39;s Love for Vandhiya devan....which went to any extend<br />to<br />  save her beloved.<br /> <br />  Poongulali&#39;s love for Arunmozhi a demonic love which gave in for<br />the betterment of all.</div></blockquote><br />Nandhini's Love for Karikalan...<br /><br />lets see what you think..<br /><br />Keep smiling<br /><br />Sridhar<br />================<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Meet people who discuss and share your passions.

But as a princess, <br />she <br />  has to be. When taking kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider <br />a <br />  lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought <br />up <br />  in such a set up, actually,<br />  falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you <br />  look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and <br />  helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be <br />  because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love <br />with <br />  a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn&#39;t<br />  have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />  bagam if I am right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above <br />anything <br />  else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable of <br />  giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty <br />  clear. <br />  <br />  * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />  <br />  She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have to <br />  keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love <br />  and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his <br />patta <br />  magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people <br />  like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />  harping that she loves AM to be his pm. <br />  <br />  * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />  <br />  As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in <br />  love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, <br />she <br />  loves her brother so much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and <br />  her brother&#41; has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In the <br />  end too, its because she<br />  realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is wrong <br />  that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux <br />situation <br />  where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother <br />is <br />  giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something else. <br />  And in the end, everything<br />  goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />  fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />with <br />  the love she has for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has <br />  done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way she <br />  did. That&#39;s not in her character. <br />  <br />  * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />  <br />  Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example <br />  of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants <br />  as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of <br />that <br />  moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />  clear. All she wants is power. In<br />  the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />  seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she <br />does <br />  fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />  scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />  reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />  again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />  including Ravidasan. <br />  <br />  * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />  <br />  She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost <br />his <br />  way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s <br />  another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried saving <br />  this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses <br />memory <br />  of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />  around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />  disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />  predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />life <br />  of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />  extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />  time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life <br />in <br />  the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />  character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not <br />can <br />  you compare her love with anyone&#39;s for as I said, she did not live <br />  her life for herself. Her life was<br />  dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. <br />  <br />  * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />  <br />  This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She <br />realized <br />  that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />  never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />  acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. <br />And <br />  that was a wise decision both for<br />  herself and for AM. <br />  <br />  <br />  Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say <br />  it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And <br />  she died in the process of saving his life. <br />  <br />  But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />  &#40;she too has plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things <br />  accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is an <br />  individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what she <br />  can give. She is not interested in going<br />  about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste <br />her <br />  time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones <br />own <br />  life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />  beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />  second. <br />  <br />  I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain <br />Head <br />  by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a <br />  particular place, that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I <br />love <br />  you&#39; you cannot understand what it actually means to love another <br />  person. That way, I feel both<br />  Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and <br />  emphatically. <br />  <br />  To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and <br />both <br />  you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. <br />  That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were <br />  Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in <br />return <br />  for their love. They are happy and<br />  they make their loved ones happy too. <br />  <br />  My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />  <br />  thanks,<br />  Vidya. <br />  <br />  ============== <br />    -----Original Message-----<br />    From: Sridhar Rathinam [  <br />  mailto:sridhar_rathinam@]<br />    Sent: Friday, October 18, 2002 12:41 AM<br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />    <br />    <br />    There has been too much of a silence lately..just to <br />  rekindle..who&#39;s<br />    love was the greatest?<br />    <br />    Kundavai&#39;s love which was ready to forsake everything for a <br />Nadodi<br />    Vandhiyadevan....&#40;Ayya indakaram patriya naan innoruvar karam<br />    pattramatten..&#41;<br />    <br />    Vanathi&#39;s love for Arunmozhi...which was ready to forsake the <br />  throne<br />    of a great empire just for his love....Vanathiyin Sabatham<br />    <br />    Mandakini&#39;s love for Sundaracholar...Looking after the heirs of <br />her<br />    beloved who left her and ending up giving her life to save him.<br />    <br />    Manimekalai&#39;s Love for Vandhiya devan....which went to any <br />extend <br />  to<br />    save her beloved.<br />    <br />    Poongulali&#39;s love for Arunmozhi a demonic love which gave in for <br />  the betterment of all.<br />  <br />  Nandhini&#39;s Love for Karikalan...<br />  <br />  lets see what you think..<br />  <br />  Keep smiling<br />  <br />  Sridhar<br />  ================<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />         <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  Meet people who discuss and share your passions.

But she did have a lot of respect and <br />  reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />  again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />  including Ravidasan. <br />  <br />  * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />  <br />  She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost his <br />  way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that&#39;s <br />  another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried saving <br />  this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses memory <br />  of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />  around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />  disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />  predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />life <br />  of herself.

She realized <br />  that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />  never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />  acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. And <br />  that was a wise decision both for<br />  herself and for AM. <br />  <br />  <br />  Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say <br />  it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And <br />  she died in the process of saving his life. <br />  <br />  But I wish to look at it this way.

That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />  second. <br />  <br />  I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain Head <br />  by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a <br />  particular place, that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I <br />love <br />  you&#39; you cannot understand what it actually means to love another <br />  person.

			<div class="content">--- Hi friends Yes I also have the same feeling about manimegalai's <br />love. Kundavai is not ready to even know about his status when he <br />was arrested for <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>death. After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> remembers him only she opens <br />her mouth. she feel it to be bad to open that topic because of her <br />status as a princess. But manimegalai also a princess of kadambur. <br />She s ready sacrifice her status of being a Queen. If she is ready <br />to marry <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>or madurandhagaer she will be the queen of chola <br />kingdom . But she ios not willing for that even without knowing that <br />whether <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is loving her or not. And nandhini's love towards <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is <br />of selfishness. So compared to these ladies manimegalai's love is <br />far far greater. And finally she became a pichi and loses her life <br />in the thought of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> itself.

But as a princess, <br />  she <br />    has to be. When taking kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to <br />consider <br />  a <br />    lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought <br />  up <br />    in such a set up, actually,<br />    falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If <br />you <br />    look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures <br />and <br />    helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be <br />    because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love <br />  with <br />    a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn&#39;t<br />    have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />    bagam if I am right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above <br />  anything <br />    else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable <br />of <br />    giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty <br />    clear. <br />    <br />    * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />    <br />    She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have <br />to <br />    keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her <br />love <br />    and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his <br />  patta <br />    magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people <br />    like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />    harping that she loves AM to be his pm. <br />    <br />    * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />    <br />    As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls <br />in <br />    love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, <br />  she <br />    loves her brother so much and this friendship between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />and <br />    her brother&#41; has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In <br />the <br />    end too, its because she<br />    realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is <br />wrong <br />    that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux <br />  situation <br />    where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother <br />  is <br />    giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something <br />else. <br />    And in the end, everything<br />    goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />    fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />  with <br />    the love she has for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has <br />    done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way <br />she <br />    did. That&#39;s not in her character. <br />    <br />    * Nandini&#39;s love for KK<br />    <br />    Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic <br />example <br />    of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she <br />wants <br />    as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of <br />  that <br />    moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />    clear. All she wants is power. In<br />    the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />    seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she <br />  does <br />    fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />    scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />    reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />    again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />    including Ravidasan. <br />    <br />    * Mandhakini&#39;s love for SC<br />    <br />    She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost <br />  his <br />    way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And <br />that&#39;s <br />    another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried <br />saving <br />    this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses <br />  memory <br />    of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />    around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />    disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />    predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />  life <br />    of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />    extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />    time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life <br />  in <br />    the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />    character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not <br />  can <br />    you compare her love with anyone&#39;s for as I said, she did not <br />live <br />    her life for herself. Her life was<br />    dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. <br />    <br />    * Poonguzhali&#39;s love for AM<br />    <br />    This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She <br />  realized <br />    that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />    never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />    acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. <br />  And <br />    that was a wise decision both for<br />    herself and for AM. <br />    <br />    <br />    Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would <br />say <br />    it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. <br />And <br />    she died in the process of saving his life. <br />    <br />    But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />    &#40;she too has plans for her life&#41; and she is deciding things <br />    accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is <br />an <br />    individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what <br />she <br />    can give. She is not interested in going<br />    about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste <br />  her <br />    time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones <br />  own <br />    life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />    beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />    second. <br />    <br />    I don&#39;t know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain <br />  Head <br />    by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at <br />a <br />    particular place, that unless you know the meaning of &#39;I&#39; in &#39;I <br />  love <br />    you&#39; you cannot understand what it actually means to love <br />another <br />    person. That way, I feel both<br />    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the &#39;I&#39; well and <br />    emphatically. <br />    <br />    To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and <br />  both <br />    you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that <br />love. <br />    That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were <br />    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in <br />  return <br />    for their love. They are happy and<br />    they make their loved ones happy too. <br />    <br />    My 5 cents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br />    <br />    thanks,<br />    Vidya. <br />    <br />    ============== <br />      -----Original Message-----<br />      From: Sridhar Rathinam [  <br />    mailto:sridhar_rathinam@]<br />      Sent: Friday, October 18, 2002 12:41 AM<br />      To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />      Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Who&#39;s Love was the greatest Love?<br />      <br />      <br />      There has been too much of a silence lately..just to <br />    rekindle..who&#39;s<br />      love was the greatest?<br />      <br />      Kundavai&#39;s love which was ready to forsake everything for a <br />  Nadodi<br />      Vandhiyadevan....&#40;Ayya indakaram patriya naan innoruvar karam<br />      pattramatten..&#41;<br />      <br />      Vanathi&#39;s love for Arunmozhi...which was ready to forsake the <br />    throne<br />      of a great empire just for his love....Vanathiyin Sabatham<br />      <br />      Mandakini&#39;s love for Sundaracholar...Looking after the heirs <br />of <br />  her<br />      beloved who left her and ending up giving her life to save him.<br />      <br />      Manimekalai&#39;s Love for Vandhiya devan....which went to any <br />  extend <br />    to<br />      save her beloved.<br />      <br />      Poongulali&#39;s love for Arunmozhi a demonic love which gave in <br />for <br />    the betterment of all.<br />    <br />    Nandhini&#39;s Love for Karikalan...<br />    <br />    lets see what you think..<br />    <br />    Keep smiling<br />    <br />    Sridhar<br />    ================<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />     <br />    <br />           <br />    ---------------------------------<br />    Meet people who discuss and share your passions.

			<div class="content">Nanbargaley,<br /><br />Please forgive for delayed response.<br />No one will ever disagree that Megala's love is the<br />greatest, but that doesn't mean Kundavai does not have<br />gr8 love to Vandiya or AV forgot Vandiya. Think about<br />the situation. With a brother dead under mysterical<br />condiditions and another brother is framed against the<br />throne, kinsmen fighting each other and mainly the<br />effect that would arise if she meets Vandiya in that<br />situation. Similarly, AV was totally into the<br />political confusions. Instead of worrying mch about<br />his late brother, he was worrying about his nation<br />which would die if he haven't taken any steps. They<br />are not ordinary people, and their acts would have<br />effect all through out the nation. Hence they have to<br />think and move.<br /><br />But Megala's love is like a devotion of a pure being<br />on god (as Kalki describes it, through vandiya in one<br />scene - 'Deivathin meedu veika vendiya patrai en<br />meedhu veithullal').Hence, like meera, she was ready<br />to give her life for Vandiya. Noone can compare two<br />persons in this world, then how can we compare their<br />love.<br /><br />Nandrigaludan,<br />Amar<br />--- dzamroodh  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- Hi friends Yes I also have the same feeling<br />  about manimegalai&#39;s<br />  love.

When taking kundhavai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />  we need to<br />  consider<br />    a<br />      lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who<br />  has been brought<br />    up<br />      in such a set up, actually,<br />      falls in love at first sight, not knowing who<br />  this guy is. If<br />  you<br />      look at the way she responds to people, she<br />  actually nurtures<br />  and<br />      helps the love to grow between the two. Her<br />  spontaneity could be<br />      because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by<br />  falling in love<br />    with<br />      a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn&#39;t<br />      have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says<br />  somewhere in the 4th<br />      bagam if I am right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha<br />  nadu above<br />    anything<br />      else in her life. She knows what she wants, what<br />  she is capable<br />  of<br />      giving and for that what she can expect in<br />  return. She is pretty<br />      clear.<br />     <br />      * Vanathi&#39;s love for AM<br />     <br />      She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not<br />  with AM. We have<br />  to<br />      keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any<br />  extreme for her<br />  love<br />      and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the<br />  throne as his<br />    patta<br />      magishi&#40;pm&#41;. As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was<br />  to silence people<br />      like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />      harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />     <br />      * Manimekalai&#39;s love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />     <br />      As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She<br />  actually falls<br />  in<br />      love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> from what her brother tells her<br />  about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like,<br />    she<br />      loves her brother so much and this friendship<br />  between them &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />  and<br />      her brother&#41; has been instrumental for the love<br />  to blossom. In<br />  the<br />      end too, its because she<br />      realizes that all that her brother had projected<br />  about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is<br />  wrong<br />      that she goes head strong in saving him. She is<br />  in a crux<br />    situation<br />      where she loves this guy but is unable to accept<br />  for her brother<br />    is<br />      giving a conflicting version and then she<br />  realizes something<br />  else.<br />      And in the end, everything<br />      goes hay way for this poor girl and she is<br />  thrown<br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Why delete messages?
