Also my theory would be that since Pulikesi could <br />  have support of jains, mahendra pallavan could have converted to <br />  saivism to garner more support from the traditional saivite country <br />  of southern tamilnadu.<br />    Regards<br />    Nanda<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    ----- Original Message ----<br />    From: Vijay Kumar .S <br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Sent: Wednesday, 28 May, 2008 9:35:47 AM<br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Tamil Sangam - Facts and Ficiton<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />      <br />      Probably the base to such legend would have been the Saiva,Jain<br />      ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar threw some <br />  poetry <br />    on<br />      palm leaves into the river...to see which one came back to <br />shore <br />  and<br />      which left to prove the religions supremacy...<br />    <br />    Hi vairam<br />    <br />    The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in front of <br />mahendra <br />    pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on water but a <br />test <br />  of <br />    fire...<br />    <br />    This happens after appar&#39;s reconversion back &#40; born as marul <br />    neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then into the <br />  shivaite <br />    faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar by gyana <br />    sambandar&#41; - the king himself into the jain faith, was goaded by <br />  the <br />    jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain monk <br />  embracing <br />    shivism...led the king to subject appar to many tortures - incl <br />  being <br />    confined into a cell for a week without food or water, being <br />  poisoned, <br />    trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then finally being <br />  tied <br />    to a stone and dropped into the sea....&#40; dont want to take the <br />    comparison to the dasavataram again&#41;....appar emerged unscathed <br />  which <br />    sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of these <br />episodes <br />  are <br />    beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar &#40; its not for nothing <br />  that he <br />    is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue&#41;<br />    <br />    inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was stronger <br />mahendra <br />    engaged appar with a debate with the jain monks...both argued for <br />  long <br />    without any clear winner emerging...finally they agreed to a <br />    test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and threw it into <br />a <br />    fire.....appar&#39; s emerged unscathed but the jain work <br />  perished...this <br />    made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not much publisised <br />  but <br />    has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out the jain faith <br />  in <br />    tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes &#40; kazuvil <br />    ettruthal&#41;, mass murder - leaving their bodies to be consumed by <br />  dogs <br />    and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king also destroyed <br />  a <br />    large number of jain schools and places of worship <br />    <br />    this is a very significant and turning point in tamil land, if <br />not <br />  for <br />    this - i would have had to sign off as vijay jain.....<br />    <br />    rgds<br />    vj<br />    <br />     <br />    <br />    Send free SMS to your Friends on Mobile from your Yahoo! <br />  Messenger.

We know from mahendra's work Mattavilasa Prahasana - ( mappula <br />vilaiyattu - crudely in tamil !!) is such a satire on Buddhism and <br />the Kapalika/ Pasupata sects of Saivism. There is a passage in the <br />play when mahendra exalts the jain method of attaining salvation - <br />their non violent methods, abstention from drinks/meat etc.<br /><br />5. from mahendra's trichy cave - Lalitankura-Pallavesvara-grham <br />verse we know for certain that he converted to worship shiva from a <br />hostile faith!!<br /><br />to read more please refer below<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article09.xml">http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article09.xml</a><!-- m --><br /><br />According to Sekkilar, a 12th century poet, the Saivite saint Appar, <br />also known as Tirunavukkarasu, was a contemporary of a Pallava <br />monarch whom he converted to Saivism. All evidences point to the <br />fact that Appar lived in the 7th Century CE. Mahendra I, Narasimha <br />I, Mahendra II and Paramesvaravarman I were the Pallava monarchs who <br />ruled in the 7th Century CE. <br /><br /><br />It is only in the Trichy inscription of Mahendra I, we have a <br />positive reference to his conversion to Saivism from some other <br />faith, while the inscriptions of other monarchs portray them as <br />great Saivites. Thus we have both epigraphical and literary <br />references, pointing to the contemporaneity of Saint Appar and <br />Mahendra. <br />This is further substantiated by other evidences. <br />In many of his verses, Appar mentions the worship of Siva in the <br />form of linga.(inkurren enru lingatte tonrinanai) (lingapuranttu <br />ullanai) <br />It is therefore evident, that the worship of Siva in the form of <br />Linga was well established long before the time of Appar and <br />Mahendra. <br />Thus the second verse of Mahendra, at Tiruchirapalli, is of historic <br />interest. It refers to the conversion of Mahendra to Saivism.<br /><br /><br />The verse under discussion reads as follows: <br /><br />Gunabhara-namani raja- nyanena lingena lingini jnanam Prathatam <br />ciraya loke vipaksavrtteh paravrttam <br /><br />See the refererence to the king as gunabara ( also a title of shiva)<br /><br /><br /><br />The first meaning of the verse is as follows: anena lingena: Through <br />the Sivalinga (established) here. Gunabhara-namani rajani: in the <br />king named Gunabhara, lingini: who bears the Linga (i.e. constantly <br />adores Siva) jnanam: the knowledge vipakshavretteh paravrttam: that <br />he has turned away from the hostile faith loke chiraya prathatam: <br />let it become well known in the world for long. <br />There is a clear reference here to Mahendra's conversion, from <br />Jainism to Saivism in the words Vipakshavrtteh paravrttam. There is <br />also an unequivocal reference to the worship of Sivalinga in the <br />terms Linga and Lingin, Lingin meaning one who bears the Linga, i.e. <br />worships Linga. <br />The second meaning of the verse will become evident when it is <br />understood in terms of the process of inference, (1. Inferential <br />cognition is accepted as a valid cognition by all systems of Indian <br />philosophy. A syllogism employed in this process of cognition <br />comprises the following elements: <br />(1) Hetu or Linga or the probans or the reason or the middle term <br />e.g. smoke (2) Sadhya or Lingin the probandum or major term which is <br />to be established, e.g. fire. (3) Paksha the subject in which the <br />probandum is not known and is to be proved, e.g. a mountain as <br />having fire when smoke which is noticed is relied upon as the <br />probans. (4) Sapaksha a similar instance in which the probandum is <br />known for certain, e.g. hearth where smoke and fire had been seen <br />together invariably. (5) Vipaksha a counter example in which the non-<br />existence of the probandum is known for certain e.g., a tank where <br />neither fire nor its concomittant smoke is known) The elements of <br />the inference are stated here in the terminology of prachina <br />(ancient) nyaya and not of modern logic. According to Gautama, the <br />author of the Nyaya sutras, the first limb of a syllogism, the <br />statement of the thesis called Pratijna is given as Sadhya-nidresa <br />and this includes the minor and major term. (1. See also <br />Mudrarakshasa Nataka, V. 10 Sadhye nischitam etc.) The invariable <br />relation between the Linga or probans or middle term, in this case <br />between the Sivalinga established by the King in that temple, and <br />the Lingin, the major term, viz., the knowledge of Siva as existing <br />in the King (the paksha or minor term) should be free from any flaw; <br />one of the flaws which would vitiate the inference is the presence <br />of this in a counter-example; i.e., it should be vipaksha-vyavrtta; <br />in the present case, this Sivalinga and knowledge and devotion to <br />the same are absent from Jainism. (2. I am thankful to my Professor, <br />Dr. Raghavan, for clarifying the meaning of the verse, on the side <br />of logic.)</div>

			<div class="content">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one pallavan did torture appar as is evident from his songsand <br />sekkilar's account.<br />who was that? mahendra or his predecessor.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />&nbsp;<br />Dear SPS,<br />&nbsp;<br />Venkatesh's above question is right. This was raised by many scholars too. And most of Appar's incidents happened near present Cuddalore (Thiruppaathiripuliyur), where some Pallava's sibling may have ruled that time. Sekkizhaar did mention that the culprit was&nbsp;Kadava King but not name. If you go through the history, most of Great Kings from Pallava dynasty wanted to name themselves as Pallava and not Kadava, although Kadava too belong to thelineage of Pallavas only. Mahendra's grand father Simhavarman's sibling AiyadigaL Kadavarkon&nbsp; is one of the 63 Nayanmars. His songs are includedin&nbsp;9th Thirumurai.<br />&nbsp;<br />May we take like this?. Pallava means Chakravarthi who ruled from Kanchi. And Kadava means Pallava clan but ruling some small part of Kingdoms under the control of Pallava. <br />&nbsp;<br />Samanam -&nbsp; came from the sanscritic word of sramanam even now prevailed in some Parts of Karnataka Hills especially Indragiri (Sravanabelagola) and Chandragiri and mostly sponsored by Marvari Jains. Presently Marvari Jains have their Jain Temples whereever they present (urban cities-mainly).<br />&nbsp;<br />There was an interesting News on Marwari Jains told by none other than OshoRajneesh (who himself was a born Vysya-jain and Marwari jains are all Vysyas)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Jain faith started with Kshatriya Kings due to the vengence fight&nbsp; versus Brahmin Parasurama. All the Theerthankars were Kshatriyas and 24th Jeena, Mahavira too, a born kshatriya. Osho said that Kshatriya Jains wanted to reach the level of Ist varnam, i.e.&nbsp;Brahmin cultures but declined slowly to the level of 3rd varnam, that is Vysyas now,because&nbsp;purely 'ego' clashes formed&nbsp; the base of religion.&nbsp;But Mahavir, as theerthankar shown the way of relinquising everything to reach the higher world, but for name sake this was taken but actionwise Mahavir was ignored. This was the statement of Osho.<br />&nbsp;<br />Samanam or Jainism was all over Tamilnadu and Karnataka during 2nd BC to 6 CE. No. doubt Jainism started from North. During Asoka's rule, the religionalmost vanished in North (Ashoka, initially belong to Jainism, according to Mr.AG.Gupta, Historian) and shifted its base to&nbsp;Karnataka Hills. Almost by 2nd century CE&nbsp;the jainism almost covered the entire region of Tamilnadu and Kings patronised them. Though the jain monks who preaches on ethics of goodlife and monks only contributed to the system and not others including Kings. The system was good and instituion was started by good intentional monks but later the religion was completely&nbsp;taken over by selfish people. (you can refer songs of Tevaram and Thivviabrabhandam - Thondaradip podi). <br />&nbsp;<br />Our guru used to say, any institution is destined to end. That was seen in Jainism.<br />&nbsp;<br />During this period, Bhuddhism was not prevailing in Tamilnadu-Karnataka, mainly because of Samanam's strong holding over the place. But Bhuddist were strong in Central and Northern part of Andhra Pradesh. The present Nagarjunasagar in Krishna riven in central Andhra and the University there, were named after a Buddha Muni, Nagarajuna Acharya, who by birth a brahmin, but embraced Bhuddism and converted the Sadhavahana Kings into Bhuddism too. Buddhist Monks established many mutts along the coromandal route during that time. Again after sathavahanas (2nd BC to 0 CE), bhuddism got vanished mainlydue to Pallava kings patronising Brahmins. Scores of copper plates were available in South Andhra on such donations. (For instance, one Vishnugopa, who was defeated by Samudhra Gupta during 330 CE (approx), when on his visitto Kovur near Nellore,&nbsp; on the spot donated the whole village to a brahmin for his service of spreading Vedha darmam through a copper<br />plate)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Dhivakar<br /><br />--- On Thu, 29/5/08, R.venketesh &lt;abhivencat@...&gt; wrote: <br /><br />From: R.venketesh &lt;abhivencat@...&gt;<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Jainism and Buddism<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Thursday, 29 May, 2008, 7:04 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; <br />&gt; In fact, Sivakami's " THALAIPPATTAL THALAIVAN THALE ..

Sekkizhaar did mention that the culprit <br />was&nbsp;Kadava King but not name. If you go through the history, <br />most of Great Kings from Pallava dynasty wanted to name themselves <br />as Pallava and not Kadava, although Kadava too belong to the lineage <br />of Pallavas only. Mahendra's grand father Simhavarman's sibling <br />AiyadigaL Kadavarkon&nbsp; is one of the 63 Nayanmars. His songs are <br />included in&nbsp;9th Thirumurai.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>&nbsp;<br />  May we take like this?. Pallava means Chakravarthi who ruled from <br />Kanchi. And Kadava means Pallava clan but ruling some small part of</div></blockquote>Kingdoms under the control of Pallava. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>&nbsp;<br />  Samanam -&nbsp; came from the sanscritic word of sramanam even now <br />prevailed in some Parts of Karnataka Hills especially Indragiri</div></blockquote>(Sravanabelagola) and Chandragiri and mostly sponsored by Marvari <br />Jains. Presently Marvari Jains have their Jain Temples whereever <br />they present (urban cities-mainly).<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>&nbsp;<br />  There was an interesting News on Marwari Jains told by none other <br />than Osho Rajneesh &#40;who himself was a born Vysya-jain and Marwari</div></blockquote>jains are all Vysyas)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Jain faith started with <br />Kshatriya Kings due to the vengence fight&nbsp; versus Brahmin <br />Parasurama. All the Theerthankars were Kshatriyas and 24th Jeena, <br />Mahavira too, a born kshatriya. Osho said that Kshatriya Jains <br />wanted to reach the level of Ist varnam, i.e.&nbsp;Brahmin cultures <br />but declined slowly to the level of 3rd varnam, that is Vysyas now, <br />because&nbsp;purely 'ego' clashes formed&nbsp; the base of <br />religion.&nbsp;But Mahavir, as theerthankar shown the way of <br />relinquising everything to reach the higher world, but for name sake <br />this was taken but actionwise Mahavir was ignored. This was the <br />statement of Osho.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>&nbsp;<br />  Samanam or Jainism was all over Tamilnadu and Karnataka during 2nd <br />BC to 6 CE.

During Asoka&#39;s</div></blockquote>rule, the religion almost vanished in North (Ashoka, initially <br />belong to Jainism, according to Mr.AG.Gupta, Historian) and shifted <br />its base to&nbsp;Karnataka Hills. Almost by 2nd century CE&nbsp;the <br />jainism almost covered the entire region of Tamilnadu and Kings <br />patronised them. Though the jain monks who preaches on ethics of <br />goodlife and monks only contributed to the system and not others <br />including Kings. The system was good and instituion was started by <br />good intentional monks but later the religion was <br />completely&nbsp;taken over by selfish people.

The present Nagarjunasagar in Krishna riven in <br />central Andhra and the University there, were named after a Buddha <br />Muni, Nagarajuna Acharya, who by birth a brahmin, but embraced <br />Bhuddism and converted the Sadhavahana Kings into Bhuddism too. <br />Buddhist Monks established many mutts along the coromandal route <br />during that time. Again after sathavahanas (2nd BC to 0 CE), <br />bhuddism got vanished mainly due to Pallava kings patronising <br />Brahmins. Scores of copper plates were available in South Andhra on <br />such donations.

			<div class="content">Vijay,<br />My favourite king also also Kopperunchinkan.&nbsp;Had he tried like Parantaka or Mahendra -&nbsp;he would have not allowed Northern Sultans in to South. leave it.<br />&nbsp;<br />But Kopperunchinken was himself satisfied with the name of Kadava Chief. When he was ruling senthamangalam, it was under the control of Chola monarch.But his game - i.e, one upmanship, prevailed for very short time. If that happened, and succeeded in controlling Pandyas, Hoysala and also Chola, KC would have started another Pallava Empire and naming himself as Kopperunchinga Verman.<br />&nbsp;<br />But he could not stop other kings called him as Kadava only and not pallava..<br />&nbsp;<br />For Pallava and Kadava combination, i can show some present day examples.<br />Here in Andhra Pradesh, the rich Kamma caste people call themselves as Chowdhrys and lesser rich's or non-prominent but same caste people being calledas Kamma only. The system is prevailing even now also.<br />&nbsp;<br />Also, the caste catagory was brought to South India, especially Tamilnadu, by Pallavas only atleast among calling themselves as Verma (Kshatriya) and later Pandyas copied this system. Even in Kshatriya caste in the present system also in Andhra Pradesh, this Vermas and Rajus are varies, though both are same. Verma goes with little higher grade than Raju.<br />&nbsp;<br />And Kanchi those days of earlier Pallava, was very famous for education andego-clashes among educated elites. One Kadamba Sarma (By birth Brahmin) came to Kanchi to learn Vedha scripts but was not allowed because he was ruling a land and the Brahmins casted him that he became himself one step down,as Kshatriya only used to rule the land. The outraged Kadamba Sarma on thespot changed his name as Kadamba Verma and left with vengence from the place.<br />&nbsp;<br />You can just give a thought, why not&nbsp; those days vermas call themselves as Pallavas and Raju's are Kadavas. One such Kadava could have ruled Thiruppaathiripuliyur.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dear SPS,<br />Kalappirar or Kalabras were native karnatakas (Some claim they even belong to Southern Madhyapradesh)&nbsp;and I find there were no relation between Kadava and Kalabra atleast. Tamil Navalar Sarithai lights us little about Kalabhras but most of other Historians did not purchase this theory. Muththariayars came close to Kalabhras later.<br />&nbsp;<br />Kadava, though a tribal outfit, the main&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallava Kings did not apply to themselves. But the other Kings like Chola or Pandya might have named them for long time. This is what I learn from Sekkizhar's calling pallava king as Kadava.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks and Regards<br />Dhivakar<br /><br />--- On Fri, 30/5/08, Vijay Kumar .S &lt;vj.episteme@...&gt; wrote: <br /><br />From: Vijay Kumar .S &lt;vj.episteme@...&gt;<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Jainism and Buddism<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, 30 May, 2008, 12:02 PM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; <br />&gt; THANK YOU DEAR DHIVAKAR &amp; DEAR VENKAT ...<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Just sharing certain things which I too come across : <br />&gt; <br />&gt; 1.
