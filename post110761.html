			<div class="content">Article on TQM system of ancient lakes through inscriptions and <br />ancient texts Following Paper is presented during the <br />brainstorming seminor on revival of ancientlakes & water bodies at <br />Bharthy dassan Univercity- Centre for remote sensing <br /><br />TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANCIENT LAKES THROUGH <br />INSCRIPTIONS AND ANCIENT TEXTS  <br /><br /><br />KEY WORKDS: ANCIENT TEXTS AND INSCRIPTIONS, WATER GOVERNANCE, <br /><br /><br />REVIVAL OF ANCIENT LAKES, PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTERSHIP My special <br />thanks to Dr.SR.ramaswamy-Bharthi Dassan university-centre for <br />remote sensing, Dr.S.Vasanthi- State Archealogy Department <br />Tamilnadu, Dr.Kannan - Water Technology centre for eastern region <br /><br />ABSTRACT: Total quality management system of ancient lakes through <br />inscriptions and ancient texts which may be helpful for future <br />planning of revival of our ancient lakes for better storage of <br />excess flood water and rainwater management for irrigation and <br />drinking water purpose. As for the study says there are lot of <br />evidences and informations from medieval inscriptions and ancient <br />text mentioned about planning, implementation, restoration, <br />conservations, preservation , management and distribution of water <br />through ancient lakes. The essence can be taken from the above <br />subject for better planning of storage of water under our National <br />Lake Conservation Plan under Ministry of Environment. Already 62 <br />lakes selected from the 1800 water bodies in India for revival of <br />lakes.  <br /><br />In Tamilnadu, more than 200 ancient manmade lakes developed under <br />various Chola, Pandiva and Pallava kings. Even Chola kings restored <br />8 th century lakes during 10th to 14th century through Lakes Board ( <br />Yeri Variyum) and also donated lands for self sustainable of <br />maintenance of particular lakes and also levied taxes for managing <br />the lakes. Further research on this subject can highlight more for <br />resolving the crisis which, we are facing for the past years. <br />Linking of lakes and inlet for excess flood water will give a <br />solution for future as mentioned by our ancient text and <br />inscriptions.  <br /><br />MEDIVEAL INSCRIPTIONS AND ANCIENT TEXTS MENTIONED ABOUT WATER <br />GOVERNANCE THROUGH LAKES There are around 60,000 inscriptions are <br />published in India by various archaeological department. Out of <br />which, 25,000 inscriptions are from Tamilnadu. Most of the <br />inscriptions are found nearby temples and nearby ancient lakes.  <br />Even ancient habitats are found in Gudiyam caves nearby Poondy <br />reservoir at near Chennai. Sangam literatures(about 2381 by 473 <br />poets) also mention about water management even for planning of <br />lakes mentioned in Purananuru which, tells about construction of <br />lakes should be like 8th day of moon which may take more water for <br />storing in the lakes. <br /><br />MEDIEVAL INSCRIPTIONS ABOUT WATER GOVERNANCE The kings of Chola, <br />Pandiya and Pallava are more concern about creating a lake with <br />local participations through Yeri Variyum ( First recorded in  <br />inscriptions in the year of 878) under the patrons of local <br />personalities. Even the strict rules and regulations were followed <br />by the locals for maintaining and proper distribution of water for <br />their mutual. <br /><br />Total quality management system was adopted in various level of <br />stages related to construction of lakes and maintenance of lakes.  <br />Government allotted lands for self sustainable of such lakes and <br />also levied taxes for maintaining the lakes. Three types of lakes <br />were prepared for better distribution systems like Kalingu fixed <br />lakes which can be used for getting excess flood water from <br />perennial rivers for distribution to the nearby auyacut areas.  <br />Yangal were fixed for excess water from the lakes can be irrigated <br />to other areas and Kuttam like Karigaikuttam developed at <br />uttharamurur were fixed for storing water. Even parameters for <br />distribution of water were adopted even 1000 years back. Even a <br />mention about the restoration of lakes in 12 century which was <br />constructed during 8 th century revenue department of Cholas at <br />Manomayan lake at Periyakulam of Nanguneri taluk of Thirunelvel <br />district is found in inscriptions.  <br /><br />VALUES OF ANCIENT LAKES South India was well known for tank <br />irrigation system and there are a number of lakes, many of which <br />might go well back to the beginning of Iron Age. It has been noticed <br />that the Megalithic sites and burials are found clustering around <br />the ancient villages near about the lakes eg. Sanur near <br />Madurantakam lake and Kunratttur lake near Sembarambakkam lake. <br />According to some scholars, tank irrigation system was started by <br />the Megalithic people in South India.   <br /><br />PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF WATER BODIES During medieval period, the <br />following boards were fixed for better management of water bodies <br />with local participation. Yeri Variyam (lake board), thotta variyam <br />(horticultural board), panchavara variyam (removing sediment from <br />lakes), Kalani variyam (related to paddy field), Kanaku variyam <br />(accounting for financial managment of lakes) and Kalingu variyam <br />(for sluice management).  <br /><br />India stands as an agrarian country from the 6th-7th <br />century onwards. The Pallavas and the Pandyas were the early <br />dynasties deeply involved in the promotion of agriculture; there by <br />the developed number of water sources. The rivers were intercepted <br />by constructing the dams in between and many sluices, creating the <br />water sources and also assured the supply of water according to the <br />needs of the area and crop. Pallavas were popular <br />for their developing lakes in remote areas and called <br />as 'Kaduvettis". Even some of the lakes were named after the kings <br />and persons who initiated the work like Magendra thadagam lake <br />constructed at Mamandur by Magendravarman, a famous Pallava king. <br />Boats were used for removing sediments and silts from the lakes.  <br />Revenue from the villager and donation of lands by the kings also <br />helped in managing the lakes by the lake board ( Yeri variyam). <br />Additional revenue was generated from the tendering of fishing <br />rights to the local communities. The efficient design <br />of lake also mentioned in the ancient text Purananuru (puram 118) <br />by Kapilar. It says that for storing of more water the lake should <br />be constructed as 8th day's moon. Such lake design is common in many <br />lakes of Thirunelvel district. Inscriptions at Perur of coimbatore <br />district in the year of 1224 A.D by Vijayabagu of Kongu Chola <br />dynasty records the direct involvement of the king in the water <br />management of his ruling area. He sent the order to the members of <br />the Sabha of Pukalidanthat on the representation of the local <br />administrators; he had permitted them to construct a dam named Devi-<br />sirai and to excavate a channel. While doing so, Kolur-anai which <br />was already in existence should not be affected; so that should be <br />filled up first, and the remaining water could be stored in the new <br />dam, he ordered. An account on few inscriptions deals about the <br />management of water bodies were mentioned in this paper. But many <br />such inscriptions and text are available which deals about the total <br />quality management of lakes. Further explorative research on the <br />above subject will give perfect tuning to the present crisis related <br />to water management of lakes. <br /><br />MANAGEMENT OF LAKES DURING CRISIS Management of lakes was adopted <br />through Yeri Variyam by the kings. Water distribution disputes were <br />also handled through kings. <br /><br />In 15th century through the judgment at Tirupathi, the king <br />Veeranarasingadevarayan, gave parameters for distribution of water <br />from Tirupathi lake. It says that excess water can be used by <br />anybody without any ratio of allotment. But during the water crisis <br />period, it should be used by ratio basis on the line of priority and <br />land patterns. In worst cases, it can be diverted on need basis. In <br />an another incident mentioned in Srirangam inscriptions during, <br />vijayanagara king period in Sriranagam by Sadasivarayar gave a <br />judgment to Narayana Jiyar for diverting water for extra flood to <br />save the Srirangam which affect a another village, in a positive <br />manner to appreciate Jiyar to save the Srirangam from the <br />flood ,king gave a favourable judgemnt on Jiyar. Several <br />inscriptions of Chola period mentioned about water management <br />through lakes and also gave strict rules and regulations for <br />maintaining the lakes for distribution of water even in the worst <br />crisis.     <br /><br />Inscriptions at Somamangalam village of kanchipuram <br />district during Kulathunga III of Chola period in the year of 1192 <br />has reported in the S.I.I vol Â–VII, No-393 located east wall of the <br />mandapa in front of the Somanathesvara temple records the continuous <br />annual flood and rehabilitation measures taken by deepening the <br />tanks and strengthening the embarkment. Due to heavy rain and flood <br />in the three consecutive years, the tank situated at Somangalam, was <br />damaged in 7 places in the same day and was repaired by one <br />Tiruchchurakkannappan Tiruvegambamudaiyar Kandavanavan, in the next <br />year also it breached in two places and the sulics and the <br />embarkements were taken up for rehabilitation. Now, the same person <br />deposited money with the sabha and from the interest of the sum, the <br />works had been executed. 40 kuli of soil was removed from outside <br />the tank and band was to be strengthened with that soil every year.<br /><br />TAX LEVIED FOR MANAGEMENT OF LAKES The following taxes were levied <br />by the kings for managing the lakes like 'chenneer <br />vetti' 'atrukarai', 'chenneer pothuvinai', 'chenneer amangi' and ' <br />kudimai' which benefited to developing of irrigated lakes, canal <br />system, maintenance of embankment, de silting of lake, and <br />afforestation nearby lake for soil conservation.  <br /><br />IMPORTANCE GIVEN FOR LAKE MAINTENANCE In the medieval period, <br />strict importance was given for preservation of lakes which can be <br />known through the following incident through inscriptions. There is <br />an inscription at Manonmayan lake of vijayanarayanam at Nanguneri of <br />Thirunelveli district inscribed during the year of 1102 AD by <br />Sadayaverman Sri Vallabapandiyan of Pandiyan dynasity called as <br />Vanian kal (vanian stone). <br /><br />It state that during the heavy rainy season during Masi month, crack <br />was developed in the left canal in 32 places. The revenue officer <br />Sangaran vasudevan rectified these cracks and gave donation of <br />land for maintanence of lakes. Even the embankment is called as <br />Vasudeva Peraru to appreciate the work of the revenue officer. <br /><br />One more incident at vijayanarayan sathurvedi managalam state that <br />a business man noticed the damage and not informed the public <br />immediately which was known to the public later. For this <br />negligence, he was killed and his body was inserted in the crack and <br />repaired. It shows that even all the traders and public also <br />responsible for maintaining the lake. Now also, this lake is called <br />as ''vanibam thondu" . Another inscription during Sadaya vallaban <br />period stat that there was an officer called Viswanathan gave land <br />for maintenance of the cracks in lakes. The revenue collected <br />through auction of fishing was utilized for preservation of lakes.<br /><br /><br />CONCLUSIONS: As my micro level study says that plenty of <br />informations are available from our ancient text and inscriptions <br />for giving better tuning to the current crisis on water management <br />and distribution of water. Revival of ancient lakes can be the only <br />solutions for coming out from the present crisis with the help of <br />further deep research on inscriptions and ancient text.  <br /><br />The present crisis of Narmada dam and cauvery issues and so many <br />issues on environmental management crisis related to dams and lakes <br />are created due to the pattern of study of lakes. <br /><br />One of our friend Mr. Christopher Hill, a famous environmental <br />historians always says ancient Indians technique of diverting the <br />flood water through the canals into the remote areas and also <br />forming a chains of such lakes like pudukottai district lakes <br />constructed during the Chola period are the better solutions <br />compared to constructing the fresh dams on the river, which create <br />scenario of all the crisis in the present ages. <br /><br />I am requesting the department to forming of self help group for <br />managing of lakes through National Lake Conservation Plan by the <br />Ministry of Environmental Department. Even it can be suggested <br />ancient lakes should be brought under National heritage monuments <br />and strict rules and regulation should be created for rehabilate the <br />people from the lake limits. Separate syllabus also suggested to <br />incorporate about the studies on inscriptions and ancient text <br />related to water governance for our future generation. A mastar <br />capacity building panel should be created for giving training to <br />NGO'S and SHG groups in India. <br /><br />Total quality management system of ancient lakes by our ancestors <br />is a better learning method for tuning ourselves in the field of <br />water governance. <br /><br />ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Thanks to Bharatidasan University Centre for <br />Remote Sensing, Tamilnadu Archeology publications published by <br />Dr.T.S.Sridhar SII Volumes of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> publications, District volumes of <br />Tamilnadu, Pazankasu publications, and various scholars from <br />Archeology department, Professors of tamil literature, CWC, <br />Environmental historians, NWDA, Ministry of Environment, Public <br />Works Department, WTCER for the help for compiling the <br />informations.  <br /><br />References: Pachainayaki, S. 2007.

			<div class="content">Dear Sir,<br /><br />Excellent article!<br /><br />It talks about the lakes and ayacut areas, what about the catchment area? In<br />the inscriptions is there any mention of regulations/restrictions for the<br />construction of building in the catchement area?<br /><br />The lakes of present days are drying up due to the obstructions of water<br />flow to the lakes from the catchment. Which results in encroachment and<br />disappearing of lakes. If the water flow to the lakes are ensured the lakes<br />can be well preserved.<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Satheesh kumar R<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />*From:*ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com[mailto: <br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->] *On Behalf Of *s.balasubramani<br />*Sent:* 29 September 2008 10:23 PM<br />*To: *ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com<br />*Subject:* [ponniyinselvan] TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANCIENT LAKES<br /><br /><br /><br />Article on TQM system of ancient lakes through inscriptions and<br />ancient texts Following Paper is presented during the<br />brainstorming seminor on revival of ancientlakes & water bodies at<br />Bharthy dassan Univercity- Centre for remote sensing<br /><br />TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANCIENT LAKES THROUGH<br />INSCRIPTIONS AND ANCIENT TEXTS<br /><br />KEY WORKDS: ANCIENT TEXTS AND INSCRIPTIONS, WATER GOVERNANCE,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />DISCLAIMER: The information contained in this communication is<br />intended solely for the use of the individual or<br /><br />entity to whom it is addressed and others authorized to receive it.
