			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by siddhartha muthu vijayan  using id siddhartha muthu vijayan </span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I was<br />continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.<br /><br />I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked me to<br />discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Nangavaram<br />(Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.<br /><br />Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the details about the<br />Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by Ms.Vandana published in<br />People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I decided that it'll<br />be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may not agree with<br />the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article but apart from<br />that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair and correct.<br />please go through the following article.<br /><br /><br />*Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*<br /><br /><br /><br />*Vandana*<br /><br /><br /><br />DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged by Commander A<br />D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship canal project<br />(SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for development by<br />attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, particularly<br />Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over due. Others<br />citing various environmental issues as well as that the project would become<br />uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in this region of<br />ocean consider it as uneconomical. In the midst of the debate a new twist<br />has been smuggled in by the BJP and the Sangh Parivar to communalise the<br />issue. Alleging that the move for dismantling of the Ram Setu, a natural<br />shoals in the region called Adams Bridge, 'is the conspiracy of Congress,<br />the Left and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam', Mr Ashok Singal, president of VHP<br />issued a threat of agitations by VHP and BJP if the project is not stopped<br />forth with.<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact the project was claimed to be the handy work of almost all the<br />parties in TN. AIADMKof Ms J Jayalalitha, MDMK of Shri V Gopalasamy, DMK of<br />Shri M Karunanidhi each claimed credit for bringing the project to TN and<br />ushering in development. Until recently even BJP too was in the bandwagon<br />saying that it was during the last NDA regime that the project was given a<br />go ahead.<br /><br /><br /><br />Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project<br />(SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an artificial canal<br />that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo containers. SSCP will<br />link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast of India. The<br />total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, Adam's bridge<br />and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a width of 300<br />meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route cut through<br />Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid circumnavigating Sri<br />Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres enabling 10,000 to<br />12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. At present for<br />the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri Lanka cruising<br />additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has witnessed hostility<br />from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much anticipated 'no<br />development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political opposition<br />for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party and<br />dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the potential mass<br />sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the region. While it<br />is important to address the genuine concerns and find a balanced development<br />path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the people of the<br />locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous opposition is<br />injurious to development and rational public debates on developmental<br />policy.<br /><br /><br /><br />BJP and the Sangh parivar have once again come off its true colours. The aim<br />is not to engage in rational debate on policy. The threat of agitation, sans<br />stoppage of the SSCP, is not based on rational scientific studies or<br />concerns arising out of it. Rather, the opposition stems from communal<br />agenda, 'the SSCP would disturb and destroy the bridge built by Lord Ram,<br />mythical Ram Sethu of Ramayana' being the sole issue.<br /><br /><br /><br />To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again resurrected false and<br />forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh Parivar<br />affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's space borne cameras<br />had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by Rama across the<br />Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had concluded that the<br />bridge to be man-made from the 'bridgeÂ´s unique curvature and compositionby<br />age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological studies reveal that<br />the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the primitive<br />age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridgeÂ´s age is also almost<br />equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during tredha yuga (more<br />than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of the 'bridge' match. The<br />SSCP would disturb this 'historical' and 'holy' structure. This in essence<br />is the claim of Sangh Parivar.<br /><br /><br /><br />Uncritically citing this news that appeared in the Internet sites<br />sympathetic to Sangh Parivar, PTI had reported the same. As the news was<br />catchy, the media uncritically lapped it. Soon however the media woke-up to<br />the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in Hindustan Times<br />on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan wrote that<br />'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark Hess<br />categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs from orbit<br />cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a chain of<br />islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were involved in<br />producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself from the story<br />and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age or nature of<br />the shoals in the region.<br /><br /><br /><br />One wonders why Sangh Parivar had to take recourse to NASA's images when<br />there are excellent images from Indian satellites? Is it due to their new<br />found love for America for waging unjustified war in the Gulf region<br />claiming it to be a war of civilisations? Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in coastal and<br />off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. Some of the<br />studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea floor depth<br />all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-1999. Seaward<br />migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is postulated that<br />the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic movement as<br />indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, mudflat,<br />strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. The chain of shoals that are<br />popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such accretion of<br />littoral currents in this region.<br /><br /><br /><br />When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's Bridge shoals was<br />questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, (published on Feb 3,<br />2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing (CRS) of<br />Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam's bridge over<br />Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years as claimed by<br />Sangh Parivar. Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the Thiruthuraipoondi<br />beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to 1,100 years. In<br />other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years ago and reached<br />Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the formation of the<br />shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained that consequent<br />dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone between<br />Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. Hoping that the public<br />memory would be short and no one would recall the denial by NASA to the<br />frivolous canards Sangh Parivar has raised the bogey of affront to Lord Ram<br />and the destruction of Ram Sethu once again. Including J Jayalalitha, chief<br />of AIADMK and mouth pieces of Sangh Parivar like V Sundaram use the same<br />exposed and discredited 'NASA report' to prop their farcical arguments.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate Department of<br />Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College assailed the Sangh<br />Parivar's fantastic claim and stated that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in The Hindu, March<br />17, 2007). Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by sedimentation<br />owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological history of the<br />Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica about 70<br />million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long shore currents on<br />the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline eastward from<br />Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lack of even basic scientific knowledge amongst Sangh Parivar and their<br />supporters is clear from the incredible claim that the first signs of human<br />inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the a primitive age, about 1,750,000<br />years ago. Indeed anyone with even basic familiarity with human evolution<br />would know that modern humans are only about 2, 00,000 years old. The oldest<br />well-dated fossils of modern humans (Homo sapiens) currently known anywhere<br />in the world is just 1, 96,000 years old. The species might have emerged a<br />lakh or two years earlier. In any case 1,750,000 years is far fetched. The<br />Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka is estimated to be populated by modern<br />humans not earlier than 80,000 years ago.<br /><br /><br /><br />While the need to debate and discuss questions of environmental concerns and<br />economic viability could be understood, communal twists to developmental<br />concern is a tragedy. Disregarding meticulous and painstaking scientific<br />research and making far-fetched claims, the party that hopes to rule this<br />country is a shame on India and its science. Once more the game of Sangh<br />Parivar is evident , its only concern is to once again divide the nation<br />along the communal lines, pitting one section of our people against another.<br />Nation, development or environment are nothing but lip service.<br /><br /><br />plese give your opinions on that.<br /><br />Let me give the details about Nangavaram and A&N experiences in my next<br />mail.<br /><br />Regards<br />Siddharth<br /><br /><br /><br />On 5/24/07, Udanx  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dei,<br /> <br />  Innuma nee indha group-la sera marukkara?<br /> <br />  ~ Udanx<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ---------- Forwarded message ----------<br />  From: R.venketesh <br />  Date: May 23, 2007 6:15 PM<br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: WHO IS NANDHINI<br />  To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Infact he also told me that<br />  Andaman and<br />    Nicobar are not Island.

I need to know whether these facts are<br />correct or not ?<br /> <br />a) When the project was conceived (approximately 140 years back), actual<br />tonnage of vessels plying were very low.<br />b) Now, this project is being aimed to increase the depth of sea so that<br />vessels upto tonnage of 25000 tonnes can use this canal.<br />c) However, there are very, very few commercial bulk carriers, tankers,<br />container vessels which have tonnage less than 25000 tonnes ply<br />around the<br />world.<br />d) As a matter of fact, even Shipping companies in India are having<br />vessels<br />more than 25000 tonnes and minimum size is on the upside only.<br />e) The estimated cost is around Rs.2400 crores and expected to be<br />completed<br />in 30 months time. Hopefully, the total cost should not exceed Rs4000<br />crores<br />(even assuming delay and inflation !)<br />f) To recover the above project costs, there are plans to recover as<br />below:<br /> <br />1) A ship shall be charged Rs.13000 per trip to use the canal.<br />(This is<br />required since pilot boats are required for guiding the main ships along<br />the canal).<br />2) The above tariff would put enormous pressure on government to<br />get the<br />moneyback from this project.<br /> <br />All the above points are purely based on commercial aspects.  <br />--------------------------------------------------<br />The above is a view of another journalist.<br /><br />CM relied on an expert opinion that there was natural sediment.<br /><br />Vandana does not seem to dispute.<br /><br />Thanks for highlighting Vandhan's views.  <br />Thanks to Mr. Udhankar again.<br /><br />Pls do contribute more and whenever possible.  <br /><br />anbudan / sps<br />====================</div>

He asked me <br />to<br />  discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />Nangavaram<br />  &#40;Great Nicobar&#41; and Adam&#39;s bridge to this group.<br />  <br />  Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam&#39;s bridge.<br />  After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the details <br />about the<br />  Adam&#39;s bridge &#40;Ram Sethu&#41;. I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />published in<br />  People&#39;s Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I decided <br />that it&#39;ll<br />  be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may not <br />agree with<br />  the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article but <br />apart from<br />  that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair and <br />correct.<br />  please go through the following article.<br />  <br />  <br />  *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  *Vandana*<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged by <br />Commander A<br />  D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship canal <br />project<br />  &#40;SSCP&#41; has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />development by<br />  attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />particularly<br />  Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over due. <br />Others<br />  citing various environmental issues as well as that the project <br />would become<br />  uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in this <br />region of<br />  ocean consider it as uneconomical. <br />  <br />  <br />  Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship Canal <br />Project<br />  &#40;SSCP&#41; aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />artificial canal<br />  that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo containers. <br />SSCP will<br />  link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast of <br />India. The<br />  total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, <br />Adam&#39;s bridge<br />  and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a width <br />of 300<br />  meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route cut <br />through<br />  Adam&#39;s Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid circumnavigating <br />Sri<br />  Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres enabling <br />10,000 to<br />  12,000 GRT &#40;gross registered ton&#41; vessels to pass through. At <br />present for<br />  the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri Lanka <br />cruising<br />  additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has witnessed <br />hostility<br />  from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much anticipated &#39;no<br />  development&#39; environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />opposition<br />  for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party and<br />  dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />potential mass<br />  sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the region. <br />While it<br />  is important to address the genuine concerns and find a balanced <br />development<br />  path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />people of the<br />  locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous opposition <br />is<br />  injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />developmental<br />  policy.<br />  <br />  To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again resurrected <br />false and<br />  forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh Parivar<br />  affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency&#39;s space <br />borne cameras<br />  had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by Rama <br />across the<br />  Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had concluded <br />that the<br />  bridge to be man-made from the &#39;bridgeÂ´s unique curvature and <br />composition by<br />  age&#39;. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological studies <br />reveal that<br />  the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the <br />primitive<br />  age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridgeÂ´s age is also almost<br />  equivalent. As Rama&#39;s rein was to have taken place during tredha <br />yuga &#40;more<br />  than 1,700,000 years ago&#41; and the alleged age of the &#39;bridge&#39; <br />match.</div></blockquote><br />The media woke-up to<br />the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />Hindustan Times<br />on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />wrote that<br />'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark <br />Hess<br />categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs <br />from orbit<br />cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />chain of<br />islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />involved in<br />producing any of the patterns seen'.

Itihas means it<br />happened. This means that Sri Ram did exist as recorded in the Ramayana.<br />The ancient seers had made clear distinction between Puranas and<br />Itihasas. Puranas are mythological, symbolic stories and Itihasas are<br />that which actually happened''.<br /><br />He said one could not dismiss Sri Ram as a mythological character just<br />because a lot of miracles were reported in his life and there are no<br />scientific evidences to prove them. ''There were unproven miracles in<br />the lives of the religious figures of other faiths'' he said adding ''if<br />we dismiss Sri Ram as fictitious character, then we have to dismiss all<br />the miracles in the lives of Jesus, Moses and Mohammed as myths'' he<br />added.<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear friends,<br /> <br />  It is worth discussing if we have anything more concrete on this.<br />  While discussing also we ensure harmoney among group members and<br />  national interity is our priority along with Desa Bakthi..<br /> <br />  The latest is <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has modified certain mentions to mytholigical data<br />  in its affadavit to SC...

Since I was<br />    continuously out of station I couldn&#39;t reply in time.<br />    <br />    I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked <br />me <br />  to<br />    discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />  Nangavaram<br />    &#40;Great Nicobar&#41; and Adam&#39;s bridge to this group.<br />    <br />    Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam&#39;s bridge.<br />    After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the details <br />  about the<br />    Adam&#39;s bridge &#40;Ram Sethu&#41;. I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />  published in<br />    People&#39;s Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I decided <br />  that it&#39;ll<br />    be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may not <br />  agree with<br />    the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article but <br />  apart from<br />    that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair and <br />  correct.<br />    please go through the following article.<br />    <br />    <br />    *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    *Vandana*<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged by <br />  Commander A<br />    D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship canal <br />  project<br />    &#40;SSCP&#41; has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />  development by<br />    attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />  particularly<br />    Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over due. <br />  Others<br />    citing various environmental issues as well as that the project <br />  would become<br />    uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in this <br />  region of<br />    ocean consider it as uneconomical. <br />    <br />    <br />    Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship <br />Canal <br />  Project<br />    &#40;SSCP&#41; aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />  artificial canal<br />    that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo containers. <br />  SSCP will<br />    link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast of <br />  India. The<br />    total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, <br />  Adam&#39;s bridge<br />    and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a <br />width <br />  of 300<br />    meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route <br />cut <br />  through<br />    Adam&#39;s Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid <br />circumnavigating <br />  Sri<br />    Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres enabling <br />  10,000 to<br />    12,000 GRT &#40;gross registered ton&#41; vessels to pass through. At <br />  present for<br />    the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri Lanka <br />  cruising<br />    additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has witnessed <br />  hostility<br />    from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much anticipated &#39;no<br />    development&#39; environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />  opposition<br />    for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party and<br />    dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />  potential mass<br />    sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the region. <br />  While it<br />    is important to address the genuine concerns and find a balanced <br />  development<br />    path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />  people of the<br />    locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />opposition <br />  is<br />    injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />  developmental<br />    policy.<br />    <br />    To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />resurrected <br />  false and<br />    forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh <br />Parivar<br />    affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency&#39;s space <br />  borne cameras<br />    had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by Rama <br />  across the<br />    Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had concluded <br />  that the<br />    bridge to be man-made from the &#39;bridgeÂ´s unique curvature and <br />  composition by<br />    age&#39;. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological studies <br />  reveal that<br />    the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to <br />the <br />  primitive<br />    age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridgeÂ´s age is also almost<br />    equivalent. As Rama&#39;s rein was to have taken place during tredha <br />  yuga &#40;more<br />    than 1,700,000 years ago&#41; and the alleged age of the &#39;bridge&#39; <br />  match. <br />  <br />  The media woke-up to<br />  the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />  Hindustan Times<br />  on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />  wrote that<br />  &#39;NASA poured cold water on the claims&#39; citing NASA official Mark <br />  Hess<br />  categorically stated that &#39;Remote sensing images or photographs <br />  from orbit<br />  cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />  chain of<br />  islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />  involved in<br />  producing any of the patterns seen&#39;. NASA distanced itself from <br />the <br />  story<br />  and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age or <br />  nature of<br />  the shoals in the region.<br />   <br />  Using the Survey of India &#40;SOI&#41;<br />    topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />  coastal and<br />    off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. <br />Some <br />  of the<br />    studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea <br />  floor depth<br />    all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-1999. <br />  Seaward<br />    migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />  postulated that<br />    the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic movement <br />as<br />    indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />mudflat,<br />    strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. <br />  <br />  The chain of shoals that are<br />  popularly called as &#39;Adam&#39;s Bridge&#39; are nothing but such accretion <br />  of<br />  littoral currents in this region.<br />   <br />   <br />    <br />    When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam&#39;s Bridge <br />  shoals was<br />    questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, &#40;published <br />  on Feb 3,<br />    2003&#41; Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing &#40;CRS&#41; <br />of<br />    Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam&#39;s <br />  bridge over<br />    Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />  Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />    beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />  Thiruthuraipoondi<br />    beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to <br />1,100 <br />  years. In<br />    other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years ago <br />  and reached<br />    Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />formation <br />  of the<br />    shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained that <br />  consequent<br />    dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone <br />  between<br />    Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the &#39;bridge&#39;. <br />  <br />  It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate Department <br />of<br />    Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College assailed  <br />  that &#39;Adam&#39;s Bridge is not a man made<br />    structure rather it&#39;s a geological phenomenon&#39; &#40;reported in The <br />  Hindu, March<br />    17, 2007&#41;. <br />  <br />  <br />  Explaining that the Adam&#39;s Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />    between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />  sedimentation<br />    owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological <br />  history of the<br />    Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. <br />  <br />  The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />    which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica <br />  about 70<br />    million years ago during the `Gondwana period.&#39; The long shore <br />  currents on<br />    the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline <br />  eastward from<br />    Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam&#39;s Bridge.<br />    <br />  <br />    While the need to debate and discuss questions of environmental <br />  concerns and<br />    economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />  developmental<br />    concern is a tragedy. <br />    Regards<br />    Siddharth</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear mr. Balasubramani,<br /><br />I agree it is a golden opportunity to undertake a study when dredging is<br />done, costly equipment is made available, divers are provided, and you<br />have chance to collect samples of dredged material. If you remember, my<br />objection was the reference email from Dr. N. Ganesan you had appended<br />to your message (18947). If that message is the reference for study,<br />then the study needs to be questioned. If you had mentioned about your<br />project, without quoting the message, I would not have responded.<br /><br />Lot of water has flowed since then; I hope your programme proceeds as<br />per schedule and yields valuable data. The Sethu is a political dynamite<br />and delhi bosses will exert great pressure to get the answers they want.<br /><br />Both in case of Rama Sethu and Ayodhya, the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> has not followed true<br />scientific spirit.<br /><br />Fortunately, our forum is free from politics and contentious issues.<br />This is not the right place to discuss such issues.<br /><br />Sampath<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "s.balasubramani"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Mr.Sampath not allowed to me discuss what was our plan on adams<br />  bridge 37 km - 500 width and 50 meters depth. when people start<br />  directly comment, witho out our objectives of finding pn<br />  archealogical studies on the particular sites with the help of there<br />  own machineries.<br /> <br />  Now under the court directions ,<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> and other 3rd parties going to do<br />  the same.</div></blockquote></div>
