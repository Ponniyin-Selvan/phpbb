			<div class="content">Panchalankurichi is visited mostly by school children<br />where they can see paintings ( recent) depicting life<br />of Kattabomman. There is a watchman who takes you<br />around the painting repeating what is written there in<br />Tamil and asks you for money at the end of the trip.<br /><br />Just outside, there is temple of Jakkamma and ruins of<br />the palace of Kattabomman. One interesting thing about<br />the place is, there is a spot which is very cool even<br />in the hot afternoon of May ( when we were there).<br />This is open to sky, but the stone is very cool. You<br />can feel it with your bare foot. The next stone is<br />very hot. This one is absolutely chill.....<br /><br />A person who claimed that he is descendent of<br />Kattabomman ( he had the relevant document issued by<br />Govt.) tells you stories of Kattabomman and told us<br />about this stone which was part of the Andhapuram,<br />which was sort of air-coolled. This guy has got a lot<br />of rare issues of history based books which God knows<br />he procured from where.<br /><br />Sad part is, at the end of the discussion, he<br />literally begs you for money.

It was here<br />that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi<br />was born on<br />January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and<br />Aarmugathammal.<br />The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who<br />was a minister<br />in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya<br />Veerapandiapuram, as<br />Ottapidaram of today was known as.<br />Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated<br />from the<br />Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and<br />was a fearless<br />warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died<br />issueless, Bommu<br />ascended the throne.<br />Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on<br />February 7, 1790,<br />and ruled for 9 years<br />The TN Government has propagated the memory of<br />Kattabomman by<br />erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in<br />Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the<br />hereditary Goddess<br />of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.<br /><br />To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of<br />Kattabomman's<br />hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal<br />stamp in his<br />honour.<br /><br />there are seven living direct descendents of the<br />Kattabomman<br />family.The Government pays each of them a monthly<br />pension of Rs. 500,<br /><br />Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the<br />nine Nava<br />Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt<br />between Thirunelveli<br />and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple<br />witnessed the<br />battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and<br />the British,<br />where the British used this temple as a fortress.<br />Battle marks are<br />seen on the temple's door.<br /><br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>- the next mail is on kattabomman the movie<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SPONSORED LINKS<br /><br />Writing book<br />Writing a book<br />Writing child book<br />Book writing software<br />Writing a book report<br />Business writing book<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />YAHOO!

I mean well preserved, respected and<br />valued). Unfortunately, the guy who is supposed to<br />come and open did not come beyond the appointed time.<br />We made 3 repeated trips on the same day, but still it<br />was not open. Compare this with the way Shakespeare's<br />house is treated in England!!<br /><br />Why are we like this??? The neighbour of this great<br />house, where a man like Bharathiyar lived, does not<br />want to even open his house to answer our questions.<br />He is happy watching a stupid serial in Sun TV when a<br />group of us want some information from him as to the<br />timings of the place... this house has been taken over<br />by Govt and it employs a man to show it around. Still,<br />this is the condition!<br /><br />Yes, I know Sivagangai Samasthanam has no connection<br />with Marudhu Pandiyar. But they had access to a lot of<br />valuable historical data which they did not really<br />value!

gathered on kattabomman- the man<br />       <br />       <br />        Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It<br />was<br />    here<br />        that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was<br />born on<br />        January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and<br />Aarmugathammal.<br />        The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a<br />    minister<br />        in King Jagaveera Pandian&#39;s durbar in Azhagiya<br />Veerapandiapuram,<br />    as<br />        Ottapidaram of today was known as.<br />        Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the<br />        Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a<br />    fearless<br />        warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless,<br />Bommu<br />        ascended the throne.<br />        Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February<br />7,<br />    1790,<br />        and ruled for 9 years<br />        The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by<br />        erecting &#40;in 1974&#41; a memorial fort in his honour in<br />        Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary<br />    Goddess<br />        of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.<br />       <br />        To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of<br />Kattabomman&#39;s<br />        hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp in<br />his<br />        honour.<br />       <br />        there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman<br />        family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of<br />Rs.<br />    500,<br />       <br />        Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava<br />        Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between<br />    Thirunelveli<br />        and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed<br />the<br />        battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the<br />    British,<br />        where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle<br />marks<br />    are<br />        seen on the temple&#39;s door.<br />       <br />       <br />        regards<br />        venketesh<br />       <br />        <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>- the next mail is on kattabomman the movie</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br />SPONSORED LINKS<br />Writing book Writing a book Writing child book Book writing software Writing a book report Business writing book<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />YAHOO!
