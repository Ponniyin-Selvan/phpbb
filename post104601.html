			<div class="content">FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !<br /><br /><br />On 8th July 2002, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sv24in" <br /> wrote:<br /><br />Who is Nandini?<br /> <br />When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while <br />we read this great epic Â– "Who is Nandini?"<br /><br />I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />secret about her life.<br /><br />Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br /><br />After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is <br />certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br /> <br />The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.<br /><br />Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />who want avenge their king's death. <br /> <br />Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br /><br />Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br /> <br />I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br /> <br />The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />emory <br />and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br /> <br />Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? <br /> <br />Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />recognize him?<br /> <br />The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />lighthouse and her last accident. <br /><br />Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />what happened to her.<br /> <br />Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />Chola household but before he could get this information to the king <br />he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that <br />she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to <br />their mother.<br /><br />Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a><!-- m -->) That is <br />also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 Â– 22 <br />years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />Either way we get the same answer Â– Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter.<br /> <br />The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />starts with a preamble that Â– "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br /><br />After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />to wonder how come they both look alike.<br /><br />When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />her father? <br />What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />told her so as well.<br /> <br />But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic!<br /> <br />Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />mad rage. <br /><br />Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br /><br />Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br /><br />Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />the way she did.    <br /><br />Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Thank you very much for such a wonderful analysis .. !<br /><br />are you watching mails still ?<br /><br />awaiting your postings.<br /><br />regards / sps</div>

After much head scratching I thought I would like to<br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while<br />  we read this great epic â€“ "Who is Nandini?"<br /> <br />  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by<br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the<br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we<br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new<br />  secret about her life.<br /> <br />  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images<br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery<br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history.<br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she<br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After<br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s story we are prepared to meet a<br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but<br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be<br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she<br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br /> <br />  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her<br />  beauty with that of Kundavai&#39;s than through a man&#39;s eyes! But it is<br />  certain that Nandini&#39;s magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the<br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her<br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick<br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava<br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is<br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br /> <br />  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan<br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini&#39;s dangerous web.<br /> <br />  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the<br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the<br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies<br />  who want avenge their king&#39;s death.<br /> <br />  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic<br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an<br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br /> <br />  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure<br />  that she is Mandakini&#39;s daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br /> <br />  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion<br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after<br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br /> <br />  The crux of the problem is Mandakini&#39;s loss of memory. Karuthiruman<br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her<br />  emory<br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br /> <br />  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the<br />  Pandya King&#39;s message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall<br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?<br /> <br />  Now let&#39;s discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan.<br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani,<br />  Mandakini&#39;s twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of<br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not<br />  recognize him?<br /> <br />  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two<br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends<br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi<br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that<br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back.<br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not<br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the<br />  lighthouse and her last accident.<br /> <br />  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her?<br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles<br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we<br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly<br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like<br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has<br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to<br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind<br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had<br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love<br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out<br />  what happened to her.<br /> <br />  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to<br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman<br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan&#39;s children are being brought up in<br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the king<br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that<br />  she was pregnant but doesn&#39;t know what happened to the babies or to<br />  their mother.<br /> <br />  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the<br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. &#40;Ref:<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1&amp;#41;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyins ... age/1&amp;#41;</a><!-- m --> That is<br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 â€“ 22<br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini.<br />  Either way we get the same answer â€“ Nandini is Veerapandiyan&#39;s<br />  daughter.<br /> <br />  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of<br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the<br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must<br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he<br />  starts with a preamble that â€“ "Is it Ok if I combine some<br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is<br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br /> <br />  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of<br />  Nandini&#39;s friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to<br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and<br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn&#39;t want anybody<br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.<br /> <br />  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes<br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini&#39;s<br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the<br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at<br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by<br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was<br />  her father?<br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan&#39;s reaction when he saw Nandini?<br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that<br />  Nandini&#39;s mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have<br />  told her so as well.<br /> <br />  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the<br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she<br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram&#39;s query. If she had<br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her<br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any<br />  logic!<br /> <br />  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him<br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she<br />  needn&#39;t have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had<br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and<br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a<br />  mad rage.<br /> <br />  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She<br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her<br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in<br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br /> <br />  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have<br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even<br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters<br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br /> <br />  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan&#39;s<br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan<br />  the way she did.<br /> <br />  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to<br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini&#39;s true love.<br /> <br />  ---------------------------<br />  Thank you very much for such a wonderful analysis .. !<br /> <br />  are you watching mails still ?<br /> <br />  awaiting your postings.<br /> <br />  regards / sps</div></blockquote><br /><br />-- <br />with luv & regards,<br />siva<br /><br />ever tried. ever failed. no matter.<br />try again. fail again. fail better.<br />-- Samuel Beckett<br /><br />Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com</div>

			<div class="content">Hi,<br />Here I would like to clarify one point that has been disturbing my mind for sometime :<br /><br />How old was Senthan Amudhan when Nandini and the old Madurantakan were born?<br /><br />When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant wasn't she?<br /><br />Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by Karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That has not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani gave birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the replacement happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. But it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar happened,kandarathitha chozhar's son(Madurantakan) was one year old. I think only because of that reason the guards went searching for Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the pattabhishekam Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house and then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think that is confusing?<br /><br />Please correct me if my argument is wrong.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Poornima<br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br /><br />FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER ..

AGAIN !<br />  <br />  On 8th July 2002, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sv24in" <br />   wrote:<br />  <br />  Who is Nandini?<br />  <br />  When Ram &#40;our moderator&#41; approached me for a weekly article based <br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while <br />  we read this great epic Â– "Who is Nandini?"<br />  <br />  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />  secret about her life.<br />  <br />  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s story we are prepared to meet a <br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br />  <br />  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />  beauty with that of Kundavai&#39;s than through a man&#39;s eyes! But it is <br />  certain that Nandini&#39;s magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br />  <br />  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini&#39;s dangerous web.<br />  <br />  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />  who want avenge their king&#39;s death. <br />  <br />  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br />  <br />  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />  that she is Mandakini&#39;s daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br />  <br />  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br />  <br />  The crux of the problem is Mandakini&#39;s loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />  emory <br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br />  <br />  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />  Pandya King&#39;s message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? <br />  <br />  Now let&#39;s discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />  Mandakini&#39;s twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />  recognize him?<br />  <br />  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />  lighthouse and her last accident. <br />  <br />  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />  what happened to her.<br />  <br />  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan&#39;s children are being brought up in <br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />king <br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that <br />  she was pregnant but doesn&#39;t know what happened to the babies or to <br />  their mother.<br />  <br />  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. &#40;Ref: <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1&amp;#41;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyins ... age/1&amp;#41;</a><!-- m --> That is <br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 Â– 22 <br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />  Either way we get the same answer Â– Nandini is Veerapandiyan&#39;s <br />  daughter.<br />  <br />  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />  starts with a preamble that Â– "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br />  <br />  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />  Nandini&#39;s friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn&#39;t want anybody <br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.<br />  <br />  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini&#39;s <br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />  her father? <br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan&#39;s reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />  Nandini&#39;s mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />  told her so as well.<br />  <br />  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram&#39;s query. If she had <br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />  logic!<br />  <br />  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />  needn&#39;t have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />  mad rage. <br />  <br />  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br />  <br />  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br />  <br />  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan&#39;s <br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />  the way she did. <br />  <br />  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini&#39;s true love.<br />  <br />  ---------------------------<br />  Thank you very much for such a wonderful analysis .. !<br />  <br />  are you watching mails still ?<br />  <br />  awaiting your postings.<br />  <br />  regards / sps<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />           <br />  <br />   <br />  ---------------------------------<br />  No need to miss a message.

Now which part of it <br />is <br />    imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br />    <br />    After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />    Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />    Nandini&#39;s friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini <br />to <br />    Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini <br />and <br />    Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn&#39;t want <br />anybody <br />    to wonder how come they both look alike.<br />    <br />    When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />    place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini&#39;s <br />    house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from <br />the <br />    Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back <br />at <br />    the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />    Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan <br />was <br />    her father? <br />    What would have been Veerapandiyan&#39;s reaction when he saw <br />Nandini? <br />    I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact <br />that <br />    Nandini&#39;s mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must <br />have <br />    told her so as well.<br />    <br />    But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />    Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in <br />the <br />    presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could <br />she <br />    have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />    Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram&#39;s query. If she <br />had <br />    realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />    brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />    logic!<br />    <br />    Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill <br />him <br />    if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />    needn&#39;t have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />    plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man <br />and <br />    that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got <br />into a <br />    mad rage. <br />    <br />    Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. <br />She <br />    had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />    wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan <br />in <br />    his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br />    <br />    Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might <br />have <br />    meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />    Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />    where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br />    <br />    Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan&#39;s <br />    daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on <br />Karikalan <br />    the way she did. <br />    <br />    Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />    thinks about these arguements of mine.

			<div class="content">I have a question to the group - historic accounts seem to conflict <br />with the reglious tolerance shown by arulmozhi during his <br />conquests...Kalki portrays a more heroic /do gooder image of <br />arulmozhi during his time in ceylon, but later day accounts ( post <br />his assession to the throne) he or atleast his armies have been <br />ruthless aka decent amount of plundering. ( even during his <br />conquests against the chalukyas - referrring to an article that <br />appeared earlier in one of hindu's publications -think it was <br />frontline - on religoius plundering in india) where statues were <br />brought back to be displayed as trophies. A large number of temples, <br />monastries were ransacked in search of treasure....could it be that <br />kalki wantedly showed his hero in good light, or did the pressures <br />of mounting such a massive war efforts n temple projects drain their <br />coffers necessiating replinshing the war chests....vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh" <br />   wrote:<br />    another classic case is murugaiyan &#40; brother of pungkuzhali&#41;who <br />is <br />    introduced as physically challenged and dumb in the start but <br />  speaks <br />    volumes later.<br />    <br />    regards<br />    venketesh<br />  <br />  Yeah, this was disturbing me too ... <br />  <br />  thanks for highlighting.<br />  <br />  sps<br />  ===============<br />    -- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Poornima Sai <br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      Hi,<br />      Here I would like to clarify one point that has been <br />  disturbing <br />    my mind for sometime : <br />         <br />      How old was Senthan Amudhan when Nandini and the old <br />  Madurantakan <br />    were born?<br />         <br />      When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant <br />    wasn&#39;t she?<br />         <br />      Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by <br />    Karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it <br />    possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That <br />  has <br />    not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani <br />gave <br />    birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the <br />  replacement <br />    happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which <br />    means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. <br />  But <br />    it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar <br />    happened,kandarathitha chozhar&#39;s son&#40;Madurantakan&#41; was one year <br />  old. <br />    I think only because of that reason the guards went searching <br />for <br />    Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the <br />pattabhishekam <br />    Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house <br />  and <br />    then was rescued and found to be pregnant.

AGAIN !<br />      <br />      On 8th July 2002, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "sv24in" <br />       wrote:<br />      <br />      Who is Nandini?<br />      <br />      When Ram &#40;our moderator&#41; approached me for a weekly article <br />  based <br />      on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering <br />  how <br />      to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />      begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />  while <br />      we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"<br />      <br />      I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all <br />by <br />      any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />      entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue <br />we <br />      get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />      secret about her life.<br />      <br />      Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting <br />images <br />      that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a <br />mystery <br />      woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her <br />history. <br />      When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her <br />but <br />  she <br />      presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />      listening to Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s story we are prepared to meet a <br />      helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man <br />but <br />      when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to <br />  be <br />      powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and <br />  she <br />      also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br />      <br />      After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an <br />  exceptionally <br />      beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare <br />  her <br />      beauty with that of Kundavai&#39;s than through a man&#39;s eyes! But <br />it <br />  is <br />      certain that Nandini&#39;s magnetism and beauty are unparalleled <br />in <br />  the <br />      novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around <br />her <br />      little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love <br />  sick <br />      puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, <br />Pallava <br />      Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan <br />who <br />  is <br />      unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br />      <br />      The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />      flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya <br />  Devan <br />      escapes from being pulled into Nandini&#39;s dangerous web.<br />      <br />      Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us <br />the <br />      reason immediately because he does not want his audience to <br />get <br />  the <br />      wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />  spies <br />      who want avenge their king&#39;s death. <br />      <br />      Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />      mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />      unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br />      <br />      Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for <br />  sure <br />      that she is Mandakini&#39;s daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />      Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br />      <br />      I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the <br />discussion <br />      because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years <br />  after <br />      Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br />      <br />      The crux of the problem is Mandakini&#39;s loss of memory. <br />  Karuthiruman <br />      saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />      emory <br />      and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />      Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br />      <br />      Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes <br />the <br />      Pandya King&#39;s message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />  fall <br />      in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? <br />      <br />      Now let&#39;s discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman <br />confesses <br />  to <br />      Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan. <br />      Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with <br />  Vani, <br />      Mandakini&#39;s twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded <br />  of <br />      Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />      recognize him?<br />      <br />      The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />      individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />      Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />  Kodi <br />      Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />      Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is <br />  back. <br />      Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does <br />  not <br />      know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />      lighthouse and her last accident. <br />      <br />      Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to <br />  her? <br />      was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />  resembles <br />      Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />  exceptionally <br />      beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If <br />we <br />      assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />      because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />      Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who <br />has <br />      been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />      rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in <br />  mind <br />      other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he <br />had <br />      traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special <br />  love <br />      or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find <br />out <br />      what happened to her.<br />      <br />      Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened <br />  to <br />      her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? <br />  Karuthiruman <br />      finds out that Veerapandiyan&#39;s children are being brought up <br />in <br />      Chola household but before he could get this information to <br />the <br />    king <br />      he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />  that <br />      she was pregnant but doesn&#39;t know what happened to the babies <br />or <br />  to <br />      their mother.<br />      <br />      Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />      Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of <br />  the <br />      Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. &#40;Ref: <br />     <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1&amp;#41;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyins ... age/1&amp;#41;</a><!-- m --> That <br />is <br />      also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? <br />22 <br />      years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on <br />Nandini. <br />      Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan&#39;s <br />      daughter.<br />      <br />      The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the <br />father <br />  of <br />      Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />      suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting <br />for <br />  the <br />      Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />      Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />      vote.

Is it<br />      possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That<br />    has<br />      not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani<br />  gave<br />      birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the<br />    replacement<br />      happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which<br />      means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born.<br />    But<br />      it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar<br />      happened,kandarathitha chozhar&#39;s son&#40;Madurantakan&#41; was one year<br />    old.<br />      I think only because of that reason the guards went searching<br />  for<br />      Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the<br />  pattabhishekam<br />      Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house<br />    and<br />      then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don&#39;t you think<br />    that<br />      is confusing?<br />       <br />        Please correct me if my argument is wrong.<br />       <br />        Thanks<br />        Poornima<br />       <br />        Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />       <br />        FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !<br />       <br />        On 8th July 2002, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "sv24in"<br />         wrote:<br />       <br />        Who is Nandini?<br />       <br />        When Ram &#40;our moderator&#41; approached me for a weekly article<br />    based<br />        on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering<br />    how<br />        to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to<br />        begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds<br />    while<br />        we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"<br />       <br />        I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all<br />  by<br />        any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the<br />        entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue<br />  we<br />        get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new<br />        secret about her life.<br />       <br />        Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting<br />  images<br />        that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a<br />  mystery<br />        woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her<br />  history.<br />        When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her<br />  but<br />    she<br />        presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After<br />        listening to Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s story we are prepared to meet a<br />        helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man<br />  but<br />        when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to<br />    be<br />        powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and<br />    she<br />        also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br />       <br />        After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an<br />    exceptionally<br />        beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare<br />    her<br />        beauty with that of Kundavai&#39;s than through a man&#39;s eyes! But<br />  it<br />    is<br />        certain that Nandini&#39;s magnetism and beauty are unparalleled<br />  in<br />    the<br />        novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around<br />  her<br />        little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love<br />    sick<br />        puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan,<br />  Pallava<br />        Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan<br />  who<br />    is<br />        unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br />       <br />        The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />        flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya<br />    Devan<br />        escapes from being pulled into Nandini&#39;s dangerous web.<br />       <br />        Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us<br />  the<br />        reason immediately because he does not want his audience to<br />  get<br />    the<br />        wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya<br />    spies<br />        who want avenge their king&#39;s death.<br />       <br />        Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic<br />        mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an<br />        unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br />       <br />        Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for<br />    sure<br />        that she is Mandakini&#39;s daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />        Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br />       <br />        I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the<br />  discussion<br />        because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years<br />    after<br />        Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br />       <br />        The crux of the problem is Mandakini&#39;s loss of memory.<br />    Karuthiruman<br />        saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her<br />        emory<br />        and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />        Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br />       <br />        Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes<br />  the<br />        Pandya King&#39;s message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan<br />    fall<br />        in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?<br />       <br />        Now let&#39;s discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman<br />  confesses<br />    to<br />        Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and<br />    Madhuranthakan.<br />        Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with<br />    Vani,<br />        Mandakini&#39;s twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded<br />    of<br />        Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not<br />        recognize him?<br />       <br />        The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two<br />        individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends<br />        Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to<br />    Kodi<br />        Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that<br />        Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is<br />    back.<br />        Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does<br />    not<br />        know what happened to her from the time she fell from the<br />        lighthouse and her last accident.<br />       <br />        Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to<br />    her?<br />        was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini<br />    resembles<br />        Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an<br />    exceptionally<br />        beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If<br />  we<br />        assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly<br />        because I cannot imagine what other business a king like<br />        Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who<br />  has<br />        been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to<br />        rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in<br />    mind<br />        other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he<br />  had<br />        traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special<br />    love<br />        or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find<br />  out<br />        what happened to her.<br />       <br />        Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened<br />    to<br />        her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby?<br />    Karuthiruman<br />        finds out that Veerapandiyan&#39;s children are being brought up<br />  in<br />        Chola household but before he could get this information to<br />  the<br />      king<br />        he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows<br />    that<br />        she was pregnant but doesn&#39;t know what happened to the babies<br />  or<br />    to<br />        their mother.<br />       <br />        Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />        Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of<br />    the<br />        Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. &#40;Ref:<br />       <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1&amp;#41;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyins ... age/1&amp;#41;</a><!-- m --> That<br />  is<br />        also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ?<br />  22<br />        years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on<br />  Nandini.<br />        Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan&#39;s<br />        daughter.<br />       <br />        The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the<br />  father<br />    of<br />        Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />        suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting<br />  for<br />    the<br />        Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />        Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must<br />        vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he<br />        starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some<br />        imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of<br />  it<br />    is<br />        imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br />       <br />        After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini<br />  to<br />        Azhvarkadiyan&#39;s parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of<br />        Nandini&#39;s friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini<br />    to<br />        Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini<br />    and<br />        Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn&#39;t want<br />    anybody<br />        to wonder how come they both look alike.<br />       <br />        When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies<br />  takes<br />        place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to<br />  Nandini&#39;s<br />        house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him<br />  from<br />    the<br />        Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get<br />  back<br />    at<br />        the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by<br />        Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that<br />  Veerapandiyan<br />    was<br />        her father?<br />        What would have been Veerapandiyan&#39;s reaction when he saw<br />    Nandini?<br />        I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact<br />    that<br />        Nandini&#39;s mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must<br />    have<br />        told her so as well.<br />       <br />        But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />        Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place<br />  in<br />    the<br />        presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could<br />    she<br />        have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />        Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram&#39;s query. If<br />  she<br />    had<br />        realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call<br />  her<br />        brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply<br />  any<br />        logic!<br />       <br />        Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill<br />    him<br />        if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him<br />  she<br />        needn&#39;t have told him anything at all let alone this. If she<br />  had<br />        plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man<br />    and<br />        that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got<br />    into a<br />        mad rage.<br />       <br />        Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan.<br />    She<br />        had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all<br />  her<br />        wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan<br />    in<br />        his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her<br />  lover.<br />       <br />        Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might<br />    have<br />        meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible.<br />  Even<br />        Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters<br />        where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br />       <br />        Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan&#39;s<br />        daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on<br />    Karikalan<br />        the way she did.<br />       <br />        Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody<br />  else<br />        thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try<br />  to<br />        unravel as to who could be Nandini&#39;s true love.<br />       <br />        ---------------------------<br />        Thank you very much for such a wonderful analysis .. !<br />       <br />        are you watching mails still ?<br />       <br />        awaiting your postings.<br />       <br />        regards / sps<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        ---------------------------------<br />        No need to miss a message.

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />this is the article that i referred to<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1725/17250620.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1725/17250620.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />quote"<br /><br />In the early eleventh century, the Chola king Rajendra I furnished <br />his capital with images he had seized from several prominent <br />neighbouring kings: Durga and Ganesha images from the Chalukyas; <br />Bhairava, Bhairavi, and Kali images from the Kalingas of Oris sa; a <br />Nandi image from the Eastern Chalukyas; and a bronze Siva image from <br />the Palas of Bengal (see Figure 4). In the mid-eleventh century, the <br />Chola king Rajadhiraja defeated the Chalukyas and plundered Kalyani, <br />taking a large black stone door guardian to his capital in <br />Thanjavur, where it was displayed to his subjects as a trophy of war <br />(see Figure 5). "<br /><br />I am also trying to find the referred article below<br /><br />Buddhist literature from Sri Lanka says that the Indian king took <br />advantage of an internal strife in Sri Lanka and invaded the island. <br />The ruthless Chola conquest was apparently no different from the <br />conduct of Mahmud of Ghazni at Somnath. The Kulavamsa says that the <br />capital Anuradhapura, which sported many Buddhist viharas, <br />was 'utterly destroyed in every way by the Chola army.' Not only <br />were the viharas decimated, but the holy stupas in them were torn <br />apart in search of treasure. As George W. Spencer observes in The <br />Politics of Expansion: The Chola Conquest of Sri Lanka and Sri <br />Vijaya, 'Even if we allow for the exaggeration of the chroniclers, <br />it is clear that the Cholas devastated the city.'

They were NEVER displayed as <br />TROPIES.  <br />  but installed with reverence and worshipped. Ref Gangaikonda <br />  Vinayagar at Kumbakonam Nageswaran Temple, Kanaka Vinayagar at <br />  Gangaikonda chozapuram, Dancing siva Bronze in Melakkadambur !<br />  <br />  ===========================<br />  <br />  A large number of temples, monastries were ransacked in search of <br />  treasure....<br />  <br />  ATLEAST SO SOUTH INDIAN KING EVER LOOTED ANY TEMPLE... to the best <br />  of my knowledge. Pandyas given grants to Bigtemple. They <br />renovated <br />  Srirangam and Chidambaram.  <br />  =============================<br />  <br />  KALKI has shown an Emperor as just a King.. <br />  <br />  sps<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  could it be that kalki wantedly showed his hero in good light, or <br />  did the pressures of mounting such a massive war efforts n temple <br />  projects drain their coffers necessiating replinshing the war <br />  chests....vj</div></blockquote></div>
