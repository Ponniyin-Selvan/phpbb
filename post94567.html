During this period of 33 years there were<br />five princes who must have occupied the throne. The irregular order<br />of the succession suggests that there must have been internal feuds<br />among the different members of the royal family. We have seen above<br />that the eldest son of Parantaka I, prince Rajaditya, lost his life in<br />the battle of Takkolam before the death of his father. Therefore,<br />this prince could not have reigned over the Chola dominions, though it<br />is stated in the Leyden plates that he became king after Parantaka I.<br />It is significant that the Tiruvalangadu grant does not make him a ruler.<br />Parantaka I was perhaps succeeded by his second son Rajakesarivarman<br />Gandaraditya. Some inscriptions of a "Madiraikonda Rajakesarivarman"<br />have been ascribed to Gandaraditya[1]. One of these which is dated in<br />his 8th year (No. 112) mentions Alvar Arikulakesarideva. The epithet<br />Alvar is taken to be one of respect. It may also indicate that he was<br />dead at the time. Another is dated in the 17th year of this king. No<br />event of any importance seems to have taken place in his reign. A<br />part of the Chola dominions must have been under the Rashtrakutas. <br />The Chola power was, for the time being, eclipsed. Hence the paucity<br />of inscriptions during his reign. Some religious hymns extant in<br />Tamil under the authorship of Gandaraditya are attributed to him. <br />These show that he must have been a king with a religious bent of<br />mind. Gandaraditya's queen was Udaiyapirattiyar alias Madevadigalar<br />sembiyan Madeviyar who bore him a son called Madhurantaka<br />Uttama-Chola. At the time of Gandaraditya's death, Uttama-Chola must<br />have been a young boy, as he was set aside in the order of succession<br />till three kings after Gandaraditya had ruled and died. His mother<br />survived her husband for a long time. She seems to have been a pious<br />lady, as she figures in several inscriptions, making donations to<br />various temples.<br />If Arikulakesari, Arikesari, Arinjaya or Arindama, died before the 8th<br />year of Gandaraditya as inferred already, the next king must have been<br />a son of Arikulakesari who, as the Anbil plates say, was prince<br />Sundara-Chola born of a Vaidumba princess. He succeeded to the Chola<br />throne under the name of Parantaka II., and bore the titles<br />Rajakesarivarman[2] and Rajendra. In his stone inscriptions<br />Sundara-Chola assumes the epithet "Pandiyanaichuram-irakkina", i.e.,<br />who caused the Pandya king to enter the forest. The large Leyden<br />grant records that he fought a sanguinary battle at Cheur, but it does<br />not mention the name of the enemy. It also says that his son Aditya<br />II., while yet a boy, played sportively with Vira-Pandya, as a lion's<br />cub with an infuriated elephant. Therefore, it may be presumed that<br />Aditya-Karikala was the chosen heir-apparent and that Sundara-Chola's<br />adversary mentioned above was the Pandya king Vira-Pandya. It is also<br />worthy of note that after Parantaka I, Sundara-Chola was the next<br />king that fought with the Pandyas. In an inscription of the reign of<br />Rajaraja I, on eof the generals of Sundara-Chola named Parantakan<br />Siriyavelar alias Tirukkarrali Pichchan of Kodumbalur is said to have<br />died in a battle-field in Ceylon in the 9th year of<br />Ponmaligai-tunjina-devar[3], i.e., Parantaka II., the father of<br />Rajaraja I. This campaign in which the general of Sundara-Chola lost<br />his life must have occurred during the reign of the Singhalese king<br />Mahinda IV., in whose reign, as stated in the Mahavamsa (Chapter LIV),<br />there was a fight with Vallabha[4], (i.e., the Chola king), in which<br />it is stated, that Mahinda's general defeated the Chola army. The<br />date ascribed by Wijesinha to Mahinda IV does not fit in with the time<br />of Parantaka II., but if we deduct the error of 23 years which,<br />according to Dr. Hultzsch has crept into this part of the chronology<br />of the Mahavamsa, Mahinda's reign would fall into the same period as<br />that of Sundara-Chola.[5] It is interesting to note that thegeneral<br />Siriyavelar or Siruvela was a member of the royal family being the son<br />of the daughter of king Parantaka I who was perhaps identical with the<br />Chola princess Anupama, the queen of Smarabhirama of the Irungola race<br />(No. 121). The Anbil plates[6] which are dated in the 4th year of<br />this king's reign, mention a Brahman minister of his named<br />Aniruddha-Brahmadhiraja.<br />As stated already, Sundara-Chola is referred to in later Chola<br />inscriptions as pon-maligaitunjina devar, i.e., the king who died in<br />the golden palace. He was a very powerful ruler, much loved by his<br />subjects. The Tiruvalangadugrants says that his subjects believed him<br />to be Manu come to the earth to establish his laws which had become<br />lax under the influence of the Kali age. His queen was<br />Vanavanmahadevi[7] who committed sati at the death of her husband. <br />Her daughter Kundavai, who had married a Pallava chief named<br />Vandyadevar set up an image of her in the temple at Tanjore.<br />If Gandaraditya ruled for at least 17 years Â– that being the latest<br />regnal year obtained from inscriptions from him Â– and Parantaka I died<br />in 947 A.D., not taking into account the date of a doubtful<br />inscription which gives the 46th year of his reign, the accession of<br />Sundara-Chola Parantaka II will fall in or about 964 A.D. which<br />coincides with the accession of Udaya III of Ceylon, as given in<br />Wijesinha's translation of the Mahavamsa. Sundara-Chola's latest year<br />of reign as given in his inscriptions is the 5th. But from a later<br />inscription of the time of Rajaraja I we learn that in the 9th year of<br />Sundara-Chola Parantaka II a deadly battle was fought in Ceylon,<br />perhaps with Udaya III, in which a general of Sundara-Chola, by name<br />Siriyavelan died. Perhaps, Sundara-Chola died soon after and we may<br />for the sake of a tentative chronology give him a reign of 10 years. <br />This brings us to A.D. 974.<br />Between him and Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya, must be<br />accommodated Parakesarivarman Aditya II Karikala, a son of<br />Sundara-Chola and elder brother of Rajaraja I, and Parthivendravarman,<br />Parthivendradivarman, Parthivendradhipativarman, Parthivendra<br />Adityavarman, Parakesari Vendiradivarman or the Paramamaharaja<br />Rajamarayar. Both these kings claim the epithet, `who took the head<br />of Pandya or Vira-Pandya Â– evidently the same Pandya king who was at<br />war with Sundara-Chola Parantaka II Â– and the title Parakesarivarman.<br />Inscriptions of the former are very few and found only in the south,<br />the latest regnal year being the 5th. Of the latter, there are many<br />in Tondai-mandalam and the latest regnal year is the 13th. <br />Parthivendra Adityavarman may have been a prince of the royal family<br />and Viceroy of Tondai-mandalam. Aditya Karikala appears to have been<br />the actual successor. He reigned for 6 years and was succeeded in 969<br />A.D. by Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya. The<br />circumstances under which the crown instead of going to Arunmolivarman<br />Rajaraja I, the younger brother of Aditya II Karikala, went to<br />uttama-Chola Madhurantaka are explained in the Tiruvalangadu plates.<br />The successions of Chola kings from Vijayalaya to Sundara-Chola<br />Parantaka II have so far presented no difficulty. The statement of<br />the Tiruvalangadu plates regarding the reigns of the princes Rajaditya<br />alias Kodandarama and Arikulakesarin alias Arinjiga or Arindama, sons<br />of Parantaka I, cannot be accepted literally. The one died as Viceroy<br />of Tondai-mandalam even before his father and the other during the<br />reign of Gandaraditya. Before, therefore, going on to the reign of<br />Uttama-Chola, it is necessary to fix approximately at any rate the<br />period of rule of Sundara-Chola who succeeded Gandaraditya under the<br />surname Rajakesarivarman[8] and of his son Parakesari Aditya II<br />Karikala. Sundara-Chola's latest year of reign as given in his<br />inscriptions is the 5th[9]. But we have seen above that in the 9th<br />year of his reign a fierce battle was fought in Ceylon with the king<br />of that island and that the Chola general Siriyavelan fell in it. <br />This shows that Sundara-Chola should have reigned at least for nine<br />years or roughly ten years, though his dated inscriptions which are<br />later than his 5th year are not forthcoming. When did Sundara-Chola<br />succeed to the throne?<br />Parakesarivarman Aditya II, surnamed Karikala and Rajaraja I surnamed<br />Arunmolivarman were the two sons of Parantaka II, and Kundavai, his<br />daughter. The Leyden plates say that Aditya II as a boy played<br />supportively in battle with Vira-Pandya and was his chosen successor<br />to the Chola throne. In inscriptions he is referred to as<br />Parakesarivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya. It is also stated<br />that he killed the Pandya king in battle and set up his lofty head as<br />a pillar of victory[10]. He seems to have had a short reign only, as<br />noted in the sequel, and nothing else worthy of note is recorded of<br />him in inscriptions.<br />We have stated that Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola Madhurantaka was the<br />son of Gandaraditya and that after the death of his father, he had to<br />wait to ascend the throne till his cousin brother Sundara-Chola and<br />the latter's son Aditya II Karikala had reigned and died. It might<br />have been so for the reason that he was an infant at the time of his<br />father's death, or that the troubled state of the country required a<br />man of maturer years at the helm of affairs. At any rate, his claim<br />was set aside for the time being. Contrary to the usual order,<br />according to which he ought to have been a Rajakesarivarman, his<br />predecessor Aditya II being Parakesarivarman, he too was called a<br />Parakesarivarman, evidently because he was the son of a<br />Rajakesarivarman and succeeded to the throne not by the right he<br />possessed but at the request of his cousin's son Rajaraja I who was<br />the chosen successor. For, according to the Tiruvalangadu plates,<br />after the death of Aditya II Karikala, the people wanted<br />Arunmolivarman his brother to be their king, but that noble prince<br />refused to accept the offer saying that so long as his uncle<br />Uttama-Chola was desirous of dominion, he would be satisfied with the<br />heir-apparentship[11].<br />In the Mahalingasvamin temple at Tiruvidaimarudur, there is an<br />inscription which couples the 13th year of Uttama-Chola with Kaliyuga<br />4083 thus yielding 969 A.D. as the initial date of his reign. <br />Uttama-Chola seems to have reigned for at least 16 years, which is the<br />date quoted in the Madras Museum plates of this king.<br />Rajaraja's achievements are fully described in the introduction to<br />Volume II by Mr. Venkayya. His son was Rajendra Chola I, who was a<br />greater monarch than his father and carried the Chola arms into<br />regions never penetrated before. During the lifetime of his father he<br />seems to have been entrusted with the affairs of the country. No<br />inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola prior to his third regnal year are<br />found. Evidently, during these three years, he was ruling as<br />co-regent with his father. According to Professor Kielhorn the reign<br />of Rajendra-Chola commenced between 27th March and 7th July 1012 A.D[12].<br />Between the third year and the twelfth he seems to have undertaken and<br />carried out successfully a vast scheme of conquests in many<br />directions. In some at least of these, he merely acted as a deputy of<br />his father. When he ascended the throne he found the Chola power<br />firmly established. He had only to carry on to its legitimate<br />conclusion the ambitious scheme of expansion started in the previous<br />reign. Before his father Rajaraja could embark on his career of<br />conquests he had to enlist and train up an army, but Rajendra-Chola<br />had inherited "the great warlike army" whose services are referred to<br />in every inscription. From: some of his Tamil inscriptions it is<br />learnt that this army of his was commanded by Solamuvendavelan and<br />that Narakkan Raman the commander of Rajaraja's forces and the<br />superintendent of the building operations of the Brihadisvara temple<br />at Tanjore continued to hold the same office till at least the 32nd<br />year of Rajendra-Chola[13]. His inscriptions up to the 5th year<br />mention the conquests of Idaiturai-nadu, Vanavasi, Kollippakkai,<br />Mannaikkadakkam and Ceylon. Idaiturainadu has been identified with<br />Ededore "2,000" lying between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra<br />comprising a large part of the present raichur district. Vanavasi is<br />identical with Banavasi in the North Kanara district and Kollippakkai<br />must have been included in the Western Chalukya kingdom somewhere in<br />the Hyderabad State, for it was set on fire by Rajadhiraja I in the<br />course of a war against Somesvara I and Vikramaditya VI, and is<br />mentioned as Kollipake in an inscription of Jayasimha II[14]. The<br />capture of Kollikppakkai must have been effected as a result of the<br />war against the Western Chalukya Irivabedanga Satyasraya conducted<br />under the direct leadership of Rajendra-Chola while Rajaraja was yet<br />living. A record of Uttattur states that in this war a certain<br />Rajamalla Muttaraiyan who was placed in charge of the elephant troops<br />was killed while piercing the elephant of Satyasraya under the orders<br />of the king. This must have happened on the occasion when, according<br />to the Hottur inscription[15], "Nurmadi-Chola[16] Rajendra (i.e.,<br />Rajendra-Chola I) had collected a force numbering 900,000, had<br />pillaged the whole country, had slaughtered the women, the children<br />and the Brahmanas and taking the girls to wife, had destroyed their<br />caste." The Hottur record is dated in A.D. 1007, but the Uttattur<br />inscription belongs to the 3rd year (A.D. 1013-14) of Rajendra-Chola<br />I. We cannot help remarking with regret on the striking infringment<br />of the ancient moralities of war by this king, however great his<br />military achievements were. In place of Mannaikkadakam the<br />Kanyakumari inscription states that Rajendra-Chola made Manyakheta the<br />playground for his armies and accordingly it looks as if<br />Mannaikkadakkam is identical with Manyakheta, as already suggested by<br />me in Ep. Ind., Vol. XVII. Mannaikonda-Chola seems to be one of the<br />surnames assumed by the king in commemoration of his conquest of<br />Manyakheta (also known as Mannaikadakkam or simply Mannai). Under<br />this name a pavilion was erected in the Siva temple at<br />Tiruvorriyur[17]. In all probability Rajendra-Chola I had to quell<br />some insurrections in these places.<br />During the reign of Rajraja I, the Chola authority was firmly<br />established over the northern half of Ceylon and this is proved by the<br />existence of his inscriptions there and by the grant of revenues of<br />certain villages in Ceylon to the temple at Tanjore which was built by<br />him. Rajendra-Chola I claims in his inscriptions "to have seized the<br />crown of the king of Ilam on the tempestuous ocean, the exceedingly<br />fine crown of his queens, the beautiful crown and the pearl necklace<br />of Indra which the king of the South, i.e., the Pandya had previously<br />deposited with that king of Ilam and the whole of Ila-mandala on the<br />transparent sea." That the Pandya king deposited his crown and<br />apparel with the king of Ceylon is mentioned in the 53rd chapter of<br />the Mahavamasa and the Pandya inscriptions mention the necklace of<br />Indra as an heirloom of Pandya kings. According to the account given<br />in the Mahavamsa, king Mahinda V, in the 36th year of his reign, was<br />captured together with his queen by the Chola army and sent as<br />prisoner to the Chola king. Among the booty was the crown that was<br />preserved by inheritance, the priceless diamond bracelet that was a<br />gift of the gods, the sword that could not be broken and the sacred<br />fillet. King Mahinda V died in the 48th year of his accession in the<br />Chola country after spending twelve years in captivity. So, it<br />becomes clear that Rajendra-Chola completed the conquest of Ceylon <br />which was begin in the reign of his father. Thereafter for several<br />years Ceylon formed a province of the Chola empire and was surnamed<br />Mummadi-Solamandalam, after the well-known surname Mummadi-Chola of<br />Rajaraja I. According to the Mahavamsa these events took place in<br />A.D. 1036, while the Tamil inscriptions show that they must have<br />happened before 1017 A.D. Professor Hultzsch has shown in his article<br />entitled "Contributions to Singhalese chronology" that there is an<br />error of some 23 years in the chronology of this part of the<br />Mahavamsa. Applying this correction, the two accounts which of course<br />refer to the same events, can be made to synchronise.<br />Between the 5th and the 6th years of Rajendra-Chola's reign, the<br />province of Malabar was also added to his conquests. The<br />Tiruvalangadu plates state that Rajendra-Chola appointed his son<br />Chola-Pandya as Viceroy of the Pandya country, as well as of the newly<br />conquered Kerala dominions. He seems to have adopted this step seeing<br />that the Pandyas had ever been a source of trouble to the Cholas from<br />the time of Parantaka I. The Chola Pandya viceroy appointed by him<br />has been identified with Jatavarman Sundara-Chola-Pandya whose<br />Mannarkoyil inscription has shown that he was ruling contemporaneously<br />with Rajendra-Chola I. It may be noted that the appointment of<br />members of the Chola family as viceroys of conquered territories<br />started by this king was continued in the successive reigns[18].<br />Between his 7th and 9th year Rajendra-Chola was engaged in subduing<br />the seven and a half lakhs country of Irattapadi. This was the<br />country of the Western Chalukya kings ruled over at this time by<br />Jayasimha II (A.D. 1018-1042). In his own inscriptions, Jayasimha<br />claims to have defeated the Cholas. As both of them boast of having<br />defeated each other, the fact ought to have been either that the<br />success was on both sides alternately or that neither of the two<br />obtained lasting advantage. Along with the Keralas he is stated to<br />have taken possession of the island of Sandimat. What this island is,<br />is not known.<br />The inscriptions of his twelfth year mention a number of places, which<br />do not appear in the list of conquests mentioned in the records of his<br />ninth year. During these three years, he must have carried on an<br />extensive campaign. He is said to have taken Sakkarakottam,<br />Maduramandalam, Namanaikkonam, Masunidesam and Panchappalli ; to have<br />defeated a certain Indraratha of the lunar race at Adinagar and to<br />have taken him and his family captive ; to have captured Odda-vishaya<br />and Kosalai-nadu ; to have defeated Dharmapala and annexed Dandabutti<br />; to have subdued Ranasura of Takkana-Ladam ; to have overcome<br />Govindachandra of Vangaladesa ; to have put to flight Mahipala and to<br />have taken Uttara-Ladam and the Ganga.<br />Of the places mentioned here, it may be noted that Sakkarakottam has<br />been identified by Rai Bahadur Hira Lal with Chakrakota, 8 miles<br />distant from Rajapura in the Bastar State, which was under the rule of<br />king Dharavarsha when Kulottunga I was the Chola sovereign. Dr.<br />Hultzsch is of opinion that Maduramandalam is different from the<br />Pandya country and that it must refer to the northern Mathura on the<br />Yamuna river.[19] Here it may be noted that one of the kings of<br />Rajapura called himself Madhurantakadeva perhaps on account of his<br />capture of Madhura. It is not likely that he could have marched<br />against Madhura of the south to earn this title. Consequently, it is<br />reasonable to suppose that Madhura or Maduramandalam was the name of a<br />district not far from Chakrakota bordering on the Vengi country. <br />Namanaikkonam, Panchapalli and Masunidesam have not yet been<br />identified. Professor Kielhorn suggests that Indraratha of the lunar<br />race captured by Rajendra-Chola at Adinagar may be identical with that<br />Indraratha who is mentioned in the Udaipur inscription as an enemy of<br />Bhojadeva of Dhara. Odda-vishaya is the province of Orissa and<br />Kosalai-nadu is southern Kosala. Dandabutti and its ruler Dharmapala<br />are not known from any other sources. Mr. R. D. Banerji is of opinion<br />that the Takkana-Ladam of the Tamil inscriptions is distinct both from<br />Gujarat (Lata) and the territory of southern Berar (Virata), and that<br />is should correspond to Dakshina-Radha a part of modern Bengal.[20]<br />Uttara-Ladam must, accordingly, denote the northern part of it. <br />Mahipala whom the Chola king deprived of his elephants and women, is<br />identified by Professor Kielhorn with the Pala king Mahipala I.<br />Most of the places mentioned here were conquered by Rajendra-Chola I<br />in his campaign against the north for the purpose of bringing the<br />sacred water of the Ganges, which earned for him the title<br />Gangaikonda-Chola. The object of Rajendra-Chola in undertaking this<br />campaign is referred to in the Tiruvalangadu grant thus[21] : -<br />"This light of the solar race, laughing at Bhagiratha who had brought<br />down the Ganges to the earth from heaven by the power of his<br />austerities, wished to sanctify his own country with the water of the<br />Ganges. Accordingly, he ordered the commander of the army, who had<br />powerful battalions under his control, who was the resort of heroism<br />and the foremost of diplomats, to subdue the enemy kings occupying the<br />countries on the banks of that river."<br />The conquest of Northern India by the Cholas must have taken place in<br />1023 A.D. the above account shows that it was a general of the Chola<br />king who conducted his campaign. But it is somewhat difficult to<br />believe how a single Chola army could overrun within one year such a<br />vast tract of country. It is also said that after vanquishing the<br />kings of the Gangetic countries Rajendra-Chola's general caused the<br />water of the sacred river to be brought to the Chola capital on the<br />heads of the conquered kings[22]. A stone record of the king found<br />at Ennayiram in the South Arcot district contains interesting<br />information regarding the conquest of the northern region by the king<br />himself, of his stately return march with all the splendour of the<br />conqueror, of his wedding the Ganga and hence assuming the title<br />Gangaikonda-Chola and building a hall called after the title at<br />Ennayiram and feeding a number of people in it. The wording of the<br />inscription seems to indicate that Rajendra-Chola I was himself<br />engaged in the expedition against the kings of Northern India<br />(Uttarapatha) and if may not be unreasonable to suppose that he did<br />not entrust the management of it merely to his generals as the wording<br />of the Tiruvalangadu plates at first sight would imply[23]. Though<br />the date of the record is effaced, the conquests enumerated in it show<br />that it cannot be earlier than A.D. 1023. It interesting to note that<br />charities which it registers for the maintenance of a hostel and a<br />college for religious instruction of every description, were made to<br />secure success to the arms of the king, showing clearly that the king<br />was at the time engaged in the war. It must have been during this<br />northern invasion that Rajendra-Chola had the lords of the Kuluta and<br />the Utkala countries slain by his generals as reported in the<br />Kanyakumari inscription[24]. The encounter with the Kuluta king is<br />also referred to in an inscription of the king found at Mahendragiri<br />where he is said to haveset up a pillar of victory. The Kanyakumar<br />inscription adds Kalinga to the list of the king's conquests. After<br />this invasion of northern India there seems to have been considerable<br />communication between the kings of northern India and the Chola<br />country. During the reign of Rajadhiraja I, the son and successor of<br />Rajendra-Chola I, the title "Protector of the people of Kannakuchchi"<br />(Kanyakubja, i.e., Kanauj) was bestowed on one of the royal princes. <br />This shows that Kanauj had close relations with the Cholas. In an<br />inscription of Kulottunga I found at Gangaikondacholapuram, the usual<br />introduction of the inscriptions of Gahadavala king Govindarachandra<br />occurs after the name of the Chola king. As the prasasti of the<br />gahadavala king was put in after the name of Kulotunga I, it seems as<br />if the Cholas had some sort of suzerainty over that northern power.<br />In commemoration of this memorable campaign in which the waters of the<br />Ganga were carried on the heads of the subdued kings, the Chola king<br />founded a new city, which he called Gangaikondacholapuram. In this<br />city, Rajendra-Chola built a great temple on the model of the<br />Rajarajesvara temple at Tanjore, built by his father. This city was<br />the capital of Chola emperors for about 100 years. Its original name<br />seems to have been Mudikondacholapuram, after another surname of the<br />king, and afterwards changed into that of Gangaikondacholapuram. It<br />had also the name Gangapuri.<br />Great as were the military achievements of Rajendra-Chola I in the<br />mainland of India, he acquired even greater fame by his navel<br />engagements, which took place on the other side of the Bay of Bengal,<br />a feat not attempted by any sovereign of India till his time. It is<br />said that he dispatched many ships in the midst of the rolling sea,<br />captured Samgramavijajotungavarman, the king of Kadaram, along with<br />his vehicles and accumulated treasure, took Sri-Vishaya, Pannai,<br />Malaiyur, Mayirudingam, Ilangasokam, Mappappalam, Mevilimbangam,<br />Valaippanduru, Takkolam, Madamalingam, Ilamuridesam, Nakkavaram and<br />Kadram. Samgramavijayottungavarman, the king against whom this war<br />was waged with great advantage of the Cholas was probably a successor<br />fo Maravijayaottungavarman of the Sailendravamsa, the lord of<br />Sri-Vishaya, who while extending the kingdom of Kataha, is reported in<br />the Leyden plates to have built a lofty and beautiful monastery at<br />Nagapattanam and called it Chudamanivarma-vihara, after the name of<br />his father Chudamanivarman. Since it is stated in the plates that<br />both Rajaraja I and Rajendra-Chola I patronized the vihara, it appears<br />that Samgramavijayaottungavarman, proving refractory, Rajendra-Chola<br />had to take the extreme step of conquering the whole of his kingdom Â–<br />in which must have been included all the places mentioned above Â– and<br />depriving him of his wealth. It is also learnt that Rajendra-Chola<br />(Shih-li-li-cha-yin-lo-lo-chu-lo) sent an embassy to China, though we<br />do not know what his intentions were in that direction[25].<br />Among the places mentioned in the final campaign of the king,<br />Sri-Vishaya or Sri-Vijaya has been taken to be the same as San-fo-tsai<br />of the Chinese annals and identified by Mr. George Coedes with the<br />residency of Palambang in Sumatra ; Nakkavaram and Pappalam stand<br />respectively for the Nicobar islands and a port of that name in Burma<br />; Takkolam has been identified with Takopa on the western part of the<br />Malay Peninsula and Kadaram is located in lower Burma. Rest of the<br />places are not known.<br />We shall here notice a few facts concerning the relations of<br />Rajendra-Chola I. Kundavai, the eldest sister of his father married a<br />chief named Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar, who figures as a feudatory in<br />some of the inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola I. The king's sister, the<br />younger Kundavai, was married to the Eastern Chalukya Vimaladitya and<br />this prince was in the Chola dominions for some time, though the<br />object of his mission is not known. Rajendra-Chola had several<br />queens. One of them was Panchavanmahadevi ; another was<br />Danti-Pirattiyar[26] and a third Viramahadevi. Of the last, an<br />inscription of Rajadhiraja states that she entered the supreme feet of<br />Brahma (i.e., died) in the very year of demise of Rajendra-Chola I<br />and was buried in the very tomb of that king[27]. This tomb in which<br />the bodies of the two royal personages were deposited might possibly<br />have been at Brahmadesam in the North Arcot district. As the record<br />is dated in the 26th year of the reign of Rajadhiraja, it is inferred<br />that, Rajendra-Chola died in that year, i.e., A.D. 1044 and that his<br />queen Viramahadevi committed sati and was buried with him[28]. The<br />Kanyakumari inscription settles the relationship of Rajendra-Chola I<br />and his successors Rajadhiraja, Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajendra. It<br />states that like unto the three fires of a sacrifice there were born<br />to Rajendra-Chola I three sons of whom the first was Rajadhiraja and<br />that Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajaendra were his younger brothers[29]. <br />Ammanga was the name of his daughter who married the Eastern Chalukya<br />king Rajaraja I : their son was Kulottunga I.<br />King Rajendra-Chola I struck coins in his own name. They are referred<br />to in his inscriptions under the names Rajendrasolan-kasu and<br />Madurantakadevan-Madai. Besides these, Rajarajan-kasu issued in the<br />time of Rajaraja I was also current in his time[30].<br />Of the literary activity displayed in the Chola country during the<br />period of rajendra Chola's rule, we know very little. Saiva works of<br />the type of Siddhantasaravali must have been largely written and<br />patronized by the king who was himself a devout Saiva. Jaina and<br />Buddhist literature also had its share of royal patronage. From: the<br />Upasakajanalankara of the Mahathera Ananda, a manuscript of which has<br />been reviewed by Dr. Barnett in the Journal of the Royal Asiactic<br />Society for January 1901, pp. 87 to 90, it may be inferred that the<br />king lent his patronage to Buddhist literature. Dr. Barnett thought<br />that the Chola-Ganga mentioned in the Upasakajanalankara was identical<br />with Anantavarman Chodaganga. This could not be, for, in the first<br />place, the latter is not a Chola but an Eastern Ganga king who ruled<br />at Kalinganagara which has been identified with Mukhalingam in the<br />Parlakimedi estate, Ganjam district. Pandubhumandala is stated to be<br />the country where Chola-Ganga was ruling as a samanta (a subordinate<br />ruler) perhaps as the viceroy of his father. This fact makes the<br />chances of his identity with Anantavarman Chodaganga very<br />problematical. Consequently, a different identification has to be<br />sought for. The king mentioned is in my opinion the famous Chola<br />emperor Rajendra-Chola I who was also called Gangaikonda-Chola on<br />account of his having subdued the country about Gangai, i.e., the<br />Ganges. His conquests, as we know, were many and spread practically<br />over the whole of India and extended even to Ceylon. The<br />Tiruvalangadu grant clearly states that Rajendra-Chola I, also called<br />Madhurantaka, took possession of the wealth of the Pandya king, placed<br />there his own son Chola-Pandy for the protection of the Pandya<br />country, and that he constructed in his capital the tank called<br />Cholagangam evidently so named after one of his own titles. This last<br />fact decisively proves the identity of the king mentioned in the<br />Upasakajanalankara with king Rajendra-Chola I. The name<br />Gunakara-Perumpalli which the king is stated to have given to one of<br />the three viharas which he founded in Ceylon also clearly indicates<br />that the builder was a Tamil king.<br />Rajendra-Chola I succeeded to the throne in A.D. 1012 and ruled till<br />at least A.D. 1044. His position as a samanta in the Pandya country<br />must have been during the early years of his heir-apparently prior to<br />A.D. 1012. The identification of Cholaganga with Rajendra-Chola will<br />thus alter the dates and the identification of the Mahathera Ananda,<br />the author of Upasakajanalankara.<br />In addition to the surnames Gangaikonda-Chola, Mudigonda-Chola and<br />Cholaganga, which have been noticed above, Rajendra-Chola also had the<br />surnames Madurantaka, Nigarili-Chola and Pandita-Chola. The last name<br />shows that he must have been considered a scholar in Sanskrit. It is<br />also stated in the Siddhantasaravali of Trilochanasivacharya that<br />Rajendra-Chola on the occasion of his visit to the Ganges saw there<br />the best of the Saivas and brought them with him and settled them at<br />Kanchi and other places in the Chola country. Information about<br />Rajadhiraja and his successors could be gathered from the elaborate<br />introductions to their inscriptions given by Prof. Hultzsch in parts<br />I. II and III.<br />[1] Below pp. 246 ff.<br />[2] This title suggests that Sundara-Chola's actual predecessor or<br />elected predecessor must have been a Parakesarivarman, and<br />Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya, bore this surname but may have<br />been too young at the time to succeed his father.<br />[3] Ep. Ind., Vol. XII, pp. 121 ff.<br />[4] This is a Sanskritized form of the Tamil word Valavan which is<br />synonymous with the word Chola.<br />[5] J.R.A.S., 1913, pp. 517.<br />[6] Ep. Ind., Vol. XV, pp. 44 to 72.<br />[7] Another queen mentioned in inscriptions was<br />Parantakandevi-Ammanar, the daughter of a Chera king.<br />[8] The adoption of the title Rajakesarivarman could be explained by<br />saying that the claims of Gandaraditya's chosen successor, viz., his<br />son Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola were temporarily set aside and<br />postponed.<br />[9] No. 122, dated in the 14th year of Rajakesarivarman has been<br />attributed to Sundara-Chola Parantaka II, but may more probably belong<br />to the reign of Rajaraja.<br />[10] See below, p. 420 V. 68.<br />[11] Loc. Cit., V. 69.<br />[12] Ep. Ind., Vol. IX, p. 217.<br />[13] Madras Epigraphical Report for 1912, p. 23.<br />[14] Ep. Ind., Vol. IX, p. 230.<br />[15] Dr. Fleet's Kanarese Dynasties, p. 438.<br />[16] The title `Nur-madi' "the hundred times (powerful)" implies not<br />that he was the hundredth powerful king in that family but that he was<br />the most powerful.<br />[17] Madras Epigraphical Report for 1913, para 24.<br />[18] Ep.
