			<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />I dont find myself knowledgable enought to comment... but its intriguing...<br /><br />Also, I second SPS that 'lack of evidence' is what keeps this controversy<br />hot. As a knowledgable and empowered group, its upto us whether<br /><br />- We are going to keep speculating and providing our point-of-views based on<br />loyalty to characters.<br /><br />or<br /><br />- We are going to do some research (possibly unearth evidence) that would<br />shed light on what actually happened.<br /><br />I would say its time for some textual research based on rationality and<br />existing evidence.<br /><br />Am thinking the best place to find some evidence about the mode/manner of<br />AK's killing would be where he was killed. (Something on the lines of "Here<br />was martyred AK, conqueror of ... etc.,). Are there any known inscriptions<br />like that?<br /><br />Just my two cents worth.<br /><br />Could any of you suggest texts by authentic tamil historians on this period,<br />that I could borrow/buy?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Madan.<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> : What happened to the efforts on 'kalvettu payirchi'? Do you need my<br />help on that?</div>

			<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, it is said that Nandini and Madurantakan( Valarpu pillai of Sembiyan Madevi) are twins. Does this mean Madurantakan is also fictious? Does it mean Senthan Amudhan was the only son (born or brought up) of Sembiyan Madevi? Why has Kalki introduced this twist?<br />Nandini doesn't affect any other character other than AK. Azhwarkku Adiyan also doesn't affect anything. What about Mandakini? She saves the king from falling victim to the plan of the Pandiyan aabathudavigal right? Is it possible somebody had really saved Sundara Chozhan from the enemies?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Poornima<br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Sundar  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>We may not know what happened 1000 years back.

			<div class="content">Talking about Mandakini devi.. Kalki has written the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> builts a temple name Singhala-nachiyar kovil.. and mentions that this temple is currently known as "Singachiyar" kovil and is in ruins in Thanjavur... and hence Mandikini devi is not fictious.. or thats the line that I will draw..<br /><br />Also, these characters Nandini, Madurantakan(Pandian), Alwar kadiyaan, manimekalai, parthibendran(some extent), kandhan maravel are not historically supported and hence can be assumed to be fictional in nature..<br /><br />Kalki's notes towards the end of the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> book points out some of this information.<br /><br />Also talking about AK's murder, I do feel that Kalki would have gone in depth and in detail with regards to understanding <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s character and the events to support and build Arulmozhi's character. Remember like every other heroic character he has built it up with character formation backgrounds through the 5 books.<br /><br />As such our varalaaru group articles have also point out the benevelont nature of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, and infact, the real growth of the Tamil nation from a fragmented society to an integrated society was brought only by forming big empires(Pallavas, Cholas) had the capability and ambition to do that, while Pandyas and Cheras have never gone beyond the North Pennar(Please correct me, I am not a historian) which has always been thought to be northern border for erstwhile tamil empires.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Nanda<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Poornima Sai  wrote:<br />Hi,<br /><br />In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, it is said that Nandini and Madurantakan( Valarpu pillai of Sembiyan Madevi) are twins. Does this mean Madurantakan is also fictious? Does it mean Senthan Amudhan was the only son (born or brought up) of Sembiyan Madevi? Why has Kalki introduced this twist?<br />Nandini doesn't affect any other character other than AK. Azhwarkku Adiyan also doesn't affect anything. What about Mandakini? She saves the king from falling victim to the plan of the Pandiyan aabathudavigal right? Is it possible somebody had really saved Sundara Chozhan from the enemies?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Poornima<br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Sundar  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>We may not know what happened 1000 years back.

			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by D Ravi  using id deviraviau</span> and user unsubscribed later<br /><br />Hi All,<br />Here's my two cents worth: <br />If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had wanted the throne, why did he decline the throne offered by the Buddihst Monks in Ceylon when he was matured enough for his age to consider murdering his brother? He could have taken up the throne, gathered enough support &amp; captured the throne from anyone, be it <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>or Utthama.<br />Devi<br /><br /><br />From: "Arun Krishnan" &lt;drarunkrishnan@...&gt;Reply-To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comTo">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comTo</a><!-- e -->:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comSubject">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.comSubject</a><!-- e -->: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK's MURDERDate: Thu, 15 Jun 2006 05:29:50 +0900<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear All,wow.. quite a lot of mails <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Looks like I really set the cat amongst the pigeons here! Dear SPS,I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I had made it so ) is <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym> fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> built the Periya Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis, Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't happened. Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> might not have been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one does not know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of building the Periya Kovil. Let me<br />put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was completely dominated by Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However, with age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to religion later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is usual human nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the things we did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had a change of heart later... However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved into...As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to reclaim the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>gone, the throne would automatically come to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> .. Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their<br />collective weights behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the move on the throne. All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect and then go on from there eliminating people one by one. Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was such a vile person that his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so Kundavai/RRC had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>actually "imprisoned" the King in the pon maaligai. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> How about that?

He had gone&gt; &gt; &gt; through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions&gt; and opined. He has&gt; &gt; &gt; been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we &gt; met and spent some&gt; &gt; &gt; time on this subject.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review&gt; this subject from the&gt; &gt; &gt; angle of investigating agency which has&gt; specialised in Poltical&gt; &gt; &gt; assassinations. Secondly such person has already&gt; invested 3 -4&gt; &gt; &gt; years of hard work in going into several&gt; inscriptions, write ups,&gt; &gt; &gt; books and other sources apart from personal&gt; interviews with&gt; &gt; &gt; acknowledged Scholars on this subject.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With<br />such rich back-ground he has reviewed the &gt; Udayarkudi&gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions and certain details evolved :&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder&gt; &amp; AK's murder.&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD. &gt; &gt; &gt; Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both&gt; / other reasons..?&gt; &gt; &gt; How : ??&gt; &gt; &gt; WHO :: ??&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.

What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the&gt; insctiptions a decade&gt; &gt; &gt; back, personally I have been maintaining that&gt; UTHAMA has a hand in &gt; &gt; &gt; the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin"<br />has&gt; been disturbing me.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This gentleman made me to look at this from&gt; another angle::&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's&gt; SAFETY till he&gt; &gt; &gt; ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the&gt; mechanism to wipe of&gt; &gt; &gt; <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He &gt; could not be Drohin.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kudavoil has been maintaining that the&gt; CONFISCATION OF LANDS took&gt; &gt; &gt; place during Uthama's tenure..&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes &gt; under cloud..&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under&gt; Sundara or Uthama?&gt; &gt; &gt; Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule&gt; in Pandya<br />Kingdom?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But when certain matters were subjected under&gt; scrutiny, the opinion&gt; &gt; &gt; is still swinging ..&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It was an interesting experience to talk to him.&gt; I have agreed to&gt; &gt; &gt; provide certain materials for his expert review.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Will report more in due course. sps&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?

			<div class="content">Devi,<br /><br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was an equally great warrior. He also had a good army. Besides there were the pazhuvettaraiyars. If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had accepted the throne, he would have betrayed the trust of the kingdom and the people and earned the enemity of his brothers and other big generals in the King's army. He was only a prince. By custom, the eldest should be the first to assume position and responsibility. If he had accepted the throne, his own people would have turned against him. Besides, there was also the problem of food and equipment. If his people had turned against him, he would not get the necessary commodities. Why leave a big Chola kingdom and settle for a small battle ravaged Ceylon?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Poornima<br /><br /><br /><br />D Ravi  wrote:<br />Hi All,<br />Here's my two cents worth:<br />If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had wanted the throne, why did he decline the throne offered by the Buddihst Monks in Ceylon when he was matured enough for his age to consider murdering his brother? He could have taken up the throne, gathered enough support & captured the throne from anyone, be it <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>or Utthama.<br />Devi<br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br />From: "Arun Krishnan" <br />Reply-To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK's MURDER<br />Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2006 05:29:50 +0900<br /><br />Dear All,<br /><br />wow.. quite a lot of mails <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Looks like I really set the cat amongst the pigeons here!<br /><br />Dear SPS,<br /><br />I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I had made it so ) is <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym> fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> built the Periya Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis, Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't happened. Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> might not have been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one does not know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of building the Periya Kovil.<br /><br />Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was completely dominated by Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However, with age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to religion later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is usual human nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the things we did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had a change of heart later...<br /><br />However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved into...<br /><br />As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to reclaim the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>gone, the throne would automatically come to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> .. Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective weights behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the move on the throne.<br /><br />All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect and then go on from there eliminating people one by one.<br /><br />Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was such a vile person that his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so Kundavai/RRC had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>actually "imprisoned" the King in the pon maaligai. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> How about that?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/15/06, Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />Hi All,<br /><br />Think of another conspiracy theory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> being able to control Uthama chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. then one day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution itself.. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just kidding.. another line of thought..<br /><br />Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and our cultures for thousands of years...<br /><br />Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI.. NO doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that would go against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan..<br /><br />mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some cases in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled..<br /><br />Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal puraa aournd Kulothungan's exile from his own kingdom(chalukya cholas from eastern chalukya or vengi)..<br /><br />Also <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> storyline has something similar to the way in which first kulothungan came to power in the chola country..<br /><br />Regards<br />Nanda<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Joseph Paulraj  wrote:<br />Hi Arun @ Aditya Karikalan,<br />( Sound pretty Good!!!).<br /><br />if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years to come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for 12 years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter to Kill UTHAMA CHOLAN ?<br /><br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after he saw the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.<br /><br />So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Joseph.<br /><br /><br />Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br />haha... maybe I should use Aditya Karikalan as my punaip peyar!:-D<br /><br />Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was an ambitious person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin" of killing his own brother <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/14/06, arul  wrote: ripe idea for another historical novel:) Use an<br />anonymous pen-name (just in case <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />-arul.<br /><br /><br />--- Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Shall I throw a a heretical thought here?

He had gone<br />      through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />  and opined. He has<br />      been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />  met and spent some<br />      time on this subject.<br />     <br />      FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />  this subject from the<br />      angle of investigating agency which has<br />  specialised in Poltical<br />      assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />  invested 3 -4<br />      years of hard work in going into several<br />  inscriptions, write ups,<br />      books and other sources apart from personal<br />  interviews with<br />      acknowledged Scholars on this subject.<br />     <br />      With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />  Udayarkudi<br />      inscriptions and certain details evolved :<br />     <br />      1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji&#39;s murder<br />  & AK&#39;s murder.<br />      2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />      Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />  / other reasons..?<br />      How : ??<br />      WHO :: ??<br />      3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />  on the above ..<br />      reviewed..<br />      4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..<br />     <br />      Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />  insctiptions a decade<br />      back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />  UTHAMA has a hand in<br />      the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />  been disturbing me.<br />     <br />      This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />  another angle::<br />     <br />      The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja&#39;s<br />  SAFETY till he<br />      ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />  mechanism to wipe of<br />      <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />  could not be Drohin.<br />     <br />      Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />  CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />      place during Uthama&#39;s tenure..<br />     <br />      If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />  under cloud..<br />     <br />      Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />  Sundara or Uthama?<br />      Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />  in Pandya Kingdom?<br />     <br />      But when certain matters were subjected under<br />  scrutiny, the opinion<br />      is still swinging ..<br />     <br />      It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />  I have agreed to<br />      provide certain materials for his expert review.<br />     <br />      Will report more in due course. sps</div></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Tired of spam?

Excellent home work done by you.<br /><br />Singala nachiar temple was not constructed by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. In Thanjavur, <br />there are TWO temples One is KODIAMMAN (Thanjai - Kumbkn near <br />Palliakkaraharam)which I again visited recently and found 2 Yoginis <br />as Dwarabalaks! (Kalki talks of this temple). There is another <br />Singalanachiar temple in the Town which we assume is named after <br />Mandakini. There is no inscriptional evidence that there was <br />Mandhakini either in Kodiakkarai, or Srilanka or in Thanjai either <br />as w/o Veerapandia or as w/o Sundara ..<br /><br />Secondly, Pls recall IMAYA VARAMBAN NEDUNCHERALATHAN - Pandian / <br />CHERAN CHENGUTTUVAN (Cheran) WHO BROUGHT STONE FROM GANGES. Also the <br />ANTWERP (CAMBODIA) temples were reportedly built by Pandyas. ( Our <br />Archieves contain enormous details on these.)<br /><br />Please do continue to contribute.. anbudan / sps</div>

It doesn&#39;t matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> built the Periya<br />  Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship<br />  I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of<br />  gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians<br />  visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis,<br />  Tirupathi&#39;s lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn&#39;t happened.<br />  Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> might not have<br />  been as innocent as one is assured that he was &#40;on what basis one does not<br />  know&#41; does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of<br />  building the Periya Kovil.<br /> <br />  Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was completely dominated<br />  by Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However,<br />  with age comes maturity &#40;and wisdom hopefully&#41;. Or perhaps he turned to<br />  religion later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is<br />  usual human nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the<br />  things we did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that<br />  <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> had a change of heart later...<br /> <br />  However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, I believe Kundavai&#39;s role needs to be delved<br />  into...<br /> <br />  As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK&#39;s death to<br />  reclaim the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and<br />  Kundavai assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>gone, the throne would automatically come to<br />  <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> .. Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like<br />  Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective weights<br />  behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue<br />  with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the<br />  Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving<br />  the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the<br />  move on the throne.<br /> <br />  All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone<br />  wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of<br />  suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect<br />  and then go on from there eliminating people one by one.<br /> <br />  Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was such a vile person<br />  that his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so<br />  Kundavai/RRC had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>actually "imprisoned" the<br />  King in the pon maaligai. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> How about that?<br /> <br />  Regards,<br /> <br />  Arun<br /> <br />  On 6/15/06, Nandakumar Selvaraj  wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi All,<br />   <br />    Think of another conspiracy theory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> being able to control Uthama<br />    chola for 16 long years&#40;an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia&#41;.. then one<br />    day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution<br />    itself.. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" /><br />   <br />    just kidding.. another line of thought..<br />   <br />    Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what<br />    they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of<br />    colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and<br />    our cultures for thousands of years...<br />   <br />    Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI..<br />    NO doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that would<br />    go against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan..<br />   <br />    mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some cases<br />    in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled..<br />   <br />    Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal puraa<br />    aournd Kulothungan&#39;s exile from his own kingdom&#40;chalukya cholas from eastern<br />    chalukya or vengi&#41;..<br />   <br />    Also <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> storyline has something similar to the way in which first<br />    kulothungan came to power in the chola country..<br />   <br />    Regards<br />    Nanda<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    *Joseph Paulraj  *wrote:<br />   <br />    Hi Arun @ Aditya Karikalan,<br />    &#40; Sound pretty Good!!!&#41;.<br />   <br />    if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years<br />    to come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for<br />    12 years ?

The word "Drohin" has<br />        been disturbing me.<br />           <br />            This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />        another angle::<br />           <br />            The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja&#39;s<br />        SAFETY till he<br />            ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />        mechanism to wipe of<br />            <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />        could not be Drohin.<br />           <br />            Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />        CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />            place during Uthama&#39;s tenure..<br />           <br />            If yes, then Uthama is absolved.

			<div class="content">Having read some of the previous discussions on the<br />topic, I think this discussion is proceeding purely on<br />the basis of speculation. While <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a suspect is a<br />diversion, I dont think there are facts or evidence<br />supporting this. What <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>has done is assume a few<br />things and built a hypothesis with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai as<br />conspirators but has offered no evidence. Cruelty by<br />Tamil kings has some truth in it (eg. Kabilar's songs<br />on Nannan, who supposedly raped and pillaged the<br />losers Kingdom). I think if a simple explanation is<br />suffice, then the complex is ruled out (occum's<br />razor!). The people with straight motive seems to be<br />the guards of Veera pandiyan(with probably the Cheras<br />helping out) and Utthama chola (who is rightfully the<br />heir). <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>has to build a roundabout conspiracy theory<br />for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and Kundavai to kill Aditya and it doesn't<br />explain the 16 year break in the rule. Also the act of<br />sacrificing the throne to Uthama doesn't gel (please<br />dont bring Sonia here!!). <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>asks to assume two<br />things. In a previous mail, it says <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> has done great<br />things by his 16th year and thus is capable of murder.<br />In a recent one, it says he was dominated by Kundavai<br />and was driven to murder. Both are at best tangential<br />at each other. If we take it that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> killed AK, it<br />still means Uthama is standing in his way and has to<br />be eliminated. If we make <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>, Kundavai and Uthama as<br />the parties to AKs murder, It leaves Uthama at a<br />stronger position to expose <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>/Kundavai's hand in the<br />murder. It needs another explanation as to why Uthama<br />didn't expose <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s hand in murder and securing the<br />line for his descendants. If we leave Uthama out of<br />this conspiracy, then the question is why did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> wait<br />16 years for claiming the throne?. Apart from the<br />empathy for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> shown by this group, I dont think<br />logically the '<acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> conspiracy' theory stands closer<br />scrutiny and thus had to be eliminated.<br /><br />While AKs suggestion can be made into a sensational<br />book and will help in selling it, I dont think it has<br />any logical basis for it.<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jeysriprakash.com">http://www.jeysriprakash.com</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sibipranav.blogspot.com">http://sibipranav.blogspot.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />"'I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, Sir,' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself you see.'"<br />-Alice in Alice In Wonderland</div>
