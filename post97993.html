It <br />is <br />      highly <br />            unlikely that the actual marriage between kundavai and <br />          vandiyathevan <br />            &#40;<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> henceforth&#41; was such a romantic affair as portrayed <br />in <br />    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. <br />            Almost every single marriage in chola family was a <br />  political <br />          affair <br />            and not a love affair. Even today most marriages in <br />  political <br />            families are calculated arrangements - we all see that.<br />            <br />            In chola days marriages were meant to strengthen the <br />      relationship <br />            between feudatories and the king so that they gained more <br />          attachment <br />            towards the central power of authority. This arrangement <br />      worked <br />          very <br />            well in the times of cholas. And it is absolutely <br />  surprising <br />      that <br />            even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called <br />  sworn <br />            enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other&#39;s <br />    family. <br />            Aditya&#39;s marriage of a kerala princess &#40;Chera Stanu ravi <br />  and <br />          Aditya <br />            I were close friends&#41; - Parantaka I&#39;s Devi Malliswarathu <br />            nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar &#40;pandiyan princess&#41; <br />  &#40;ref <br />      ARE <br />        44 <br />            of 1895&#41; are all examples of this practice.<br />            <br />            Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was given <br />  in <br />            marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging to <br />  that <br />          family <br />            and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 <br />bears <br />      solid <br />            testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand <br />  donation <br />      of a <br />            queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR <br />and <br />  a <br />          senior <br />            queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol <br />  XXVI <br />      page <br />            233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with <br />  Rashtrakuta <br />      king <br />            Krishna II.<br />            <br />            Thus there was a close political nexus and the practice <br />of <br />          marrying <br />            rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. <br />Though <br />            rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja&#39;s <br />  times <br />    it <br />            should have been with a purpose that kundavai married <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />            <br />            And what was that ?<br />            <br />            Anbudan<br />            G<br />            <br />            <br />            <br />            <br />            <br />            SPONSORED LINKS <br />            Writing a book report Writing and publishing a book <br />  Writing <br />      child <br />          book Book writing software Writing book Business writing <br />  book <br />            <br />            ---------------------------------<br />            YAHOO!

Even today most marriages in <br />    political <br />              families are calculated arrangements - we all see that.<br />              <br />              In chola days marriages were meant to strengthen the <br />        relationship <br />              between feudatories and the king so that they gained <br />more <br />            attachment <br />              towards the central power of authority. This <br />arrangement <br />        worked <br />            very <br />              well in the times of cholas. And it is absolutely <br />    surprising <br />        that <br />              even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called <br />    sworn <br />              enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other&#39;s <br />      family. <br />              Aditya&#39;s marriage of a kerala princess &#40;Chera Stanu <br />ravi <br />    and <br />            Aditya <br />              I were close friends&#41; - Parantaka I&#39;s Devi <br />Malliswarathu <br />              nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar &#40;pandiyan princess&#41; <br />    &#40;ref <br />        ARE <br />          44 <br />              of 1895&#41; are all examples of this practice.<br />              <br />              Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was <br />given <br />    in <br />              marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging <br />to <br />    that <br />            family <br />              and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 <br />  bears <br />        solid <br />              testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand <br />    donation <br />        of a <br />              queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR <br />  and <br />    a <br />            senior <br />              queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol <br />    XXVI <br />        page <br />              233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with <br />    Rashtrakuta <br />        king <br />              Krishna II.<br />              <br />              Thus there was a close political nexus and the <br />practice <br />  of <br />            marrying <br />              rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. <br />  Though <br />              rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja&#39;s <br />    times <br />      it <br />              should have been with a purpose that kundavai married <br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />              <br />              And what was that ?<br />              <br />              Anbudan<br />              G<br />              <br />              <br />              <br />              <br />              <br />              SPONSORED LINKS <br />              Writing a book report Writing and publishing a book <br />    Writing <br />        child <br />            book Book writing software Writing book Business writing <br />    book <br />              <br />              ---------------------------------<br />              YAHOO!
