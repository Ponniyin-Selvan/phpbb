			<div class="content">Dear Shobha, my goal is the same, I think it is very important to give backto roots, as much as possible.

Second is that these cultural values go away only because we move out - it is not so and is happening quite widely in India too. Most modern indian kids do not know the pleasure of family vacations, home cooked treats, simple pleasures like playing outside, and reading books connected to tradition. Video games, movies and eating out have largely taken over combined with increased cost of living and nuclear families. <br />Â <br />It is unfortunate that we have to live through such times but also to remember eveyr generation that passed felt similar that the next generation has lost its values.

			<div class="content">Dear Malathi<br />Thanks. I am definitely not of the opinion that NRIs are after money. And one has to make a living & also save for rainy day so why not go where it isavailable? Nor am I saying that people who go out forget their culture & tradition, rather I've seen all the festivals celebrated in countries outside India . Even temples abroad have become a place for socialising which used to be in India onceupon a time.<br />As u've rightly said going back to a gramam may be difficult, but can stillconsider the nearest town. My point is if everyone wants to settle down only in Metros, then there is no control over the way the rent level & other costs going up in metros.<br />Â <br />Madan, <br />No worry.

			<div class="content">Shoba, yes that is very very true, what you say regarding cities becoming concentrated and cost of living going up skyward. One NRI friend of mine actually adopted a small village in Punjab, a couple of hours drive from the nearest city - he has a big home there, and has done a lot for the village. But he had that kind of money, and the heart to go with it!!<br />Â <br />It is not an easy decision to make for many for us, even moving back home itself. One thing that bothers me about our cutlure is lack of dignity of labor, I mean I know several people who move back because they need 'domestichelp', and labor is cheap. Definitely not something available abroad. I dont know if I want that to be my reason. Definitely not. Although it is great to have someone clean the house and do my dishes.
