Time and again, he<br />  stumbles across<br />  things and<br />          events more or less catch up to him rather<br />  than his shaping<br />  things. Maybe<br />          Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that<br />  he was like a<br />  leaf caught in the<br />          Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that&#39;s<br />  what it looks<br />  like to me.<br />         <br />          Comments?<br />         <br />          Arun<br />         <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        --<br />        with luv & regards,<br />        siva<br />       <br />        My Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com<br />       <br />       <br />     <br />     <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    --<br />    with luv & regards,<br />    siva<br />   <br />    My Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com<br />   <br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br />Send free SMS to your Friends on Mobile from your Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Sri,<br /><br />Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan, Kunthavai's real life husband<br />with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I called Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />idiot, it was the character I was referring to. The character as portrayed<br />by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be someone who is very<br />brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to incident, mostly by<br />chance. Again, this is the character we are talking about, not the<br />historical personality <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 12/31/06, sivaram Kannan  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Guess this is full stop to the topic.<br /> <br /> <br />  On 12/31/06, sridhar rathinam  wrote:<br />   <br />    Dear Arun<br />    you can say anyone is an idiot if you just took one snap shot of their<br />    life...<br />   <br />    A stranger walks with a message in a hostile atmosphere...enters a<br />    hostile castle...by his own wit..... learns valauble information....it may<br />    be chance it may be fate....<br />    makes an oppurtunity from that by banging his horse on Ilayaranis<br />    pallakku......uses his wit and inteligence on Chinna paluvetarayar....saying<br />    his brother said to deliver the message in person.....delivers his message<br />    and gives a plausible explanation.....finds out he has lost the other<br />    message.....makes a trick and gets it from chinna paluvettarayar....gets out<br />    from his grip....gets to nandhini&#40;chance&#41;...resists her charm....into the<br />    nilavarai....&#40;chance&#41;<br />    resists the desire of worldly wealth...saves his freind....escapes from<br />    thanjavur....just because sendhan doesnt want to lie jumps into the<br />    river....fights Ravidasan and escapes.....tricks the dance company and<br />    disguises as Kamsan and meets IsanaPandithar and meets Kundavai and delivers<br />    the message!!!!!<br />   <br />    I am sure you have read all this before going to the second volume.....<br />   <br />    would you say Karikala wasnt valiant because a asiriri laed him to<br />    Virapandiyan?<br />   <br />    Ilayapallavan looses his sword to Kanjana devi.....is saved from the<br />    courts of Kalinga by Kanjana Devi.....is saved from death from the horses by<br />    Amir.....but he is alrger than life<br />   <br />    please for heavens sake stop calling him an idiot because however Kalki<br />    potrays him he was a great statsman and admistrater of the Mideaval Chola<br />    empire He was Rajendra&#39;s Samandhanayakar for gods sake<br />    regards<br />   <br />    Sri<br />   <br />    *Arun Krishnan * wrote:<br />   <br />    Well I am rereading it now.. &#40;<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> I mean&#41;.. and started the second<br />    book.. so Vanthiyathevan goes to Kodikkarai.. meets Poonguzhali... falls<br />    into a ditch... is rescued by her.. she tells him about people looking for<br />    him..

Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be someone who is very brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to incident, mostly by chance.

			<div class="content">Arun,<br /><br />No problem if you call the real <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> as idiot. We dont<br />know much about him. He belongs to real Kundhavai and<br />history. But Kalki's <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is fully ours. We know most of<br />him. You dared to call our <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> as idiot and I think you<br />do this to draw maximum out of our members. Go on. You<br />will get it. Soon you will have my share too!<br /><br />--- Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Sri,<br /> <br />  Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan,<br />  Kunthavai&#39;s real life husband<br />  with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I called<br />  Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />  idiot, it was the character I was referring to. The<br />  character as portrayed<br />  by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be<br />  someone who is very<br />  brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to<br />  incident, mostly by<br />  chance. Again, this is the character we are talking<br />  about, not the<br />  historical personality <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /><br /> <br />  Cheers,<br /> <br />  Arun<br /> <br />  On 12/31/06, sivaram Kannan <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />   <br />    Guess this is full stop to the topic.<br />   <br />   <br />    On 12/31/06, sridhar rathinam<br />   wrote:<br />     <br />      Dear Arun<br />      you can say anyone is an idiot if you just took<br />  one snap shot of their<br />      life...<br />     <br />      A stranger walks with a message in a hostile<br />  atmosphere...enters a<br />      hostile castle...by his own wit..... learns<br />  valauble information....it may<br />      be chance it may be fate....<br />      makes an oppurtunity from that by banging his<br />  horse on Ilayaranis<br />      pallakku......uses his wit and inteligence on<br />  Chinna paluvetarayar....saying<br />      his brother said to deliver the message in<br />  person.....delivers his message<br />      and gives a plausible explanation.....finds out<br />  he has lost the other<br />      message.....makes a trick and gets it from<br />  chinna paluvettarayar....gets out<br />      from his grip....gets to<br />  nandhini&#40;chance&#41;...resists her charm....into the<br />      nilavarai....&#40;chance&#41;<br />      resists the desire of worldly wealth...saves<br />  his freind....escapes from<br />      thanjavur....just because sendhan doesnt want to<br />  lie jumps into the<br />      river....fights Ravidasan and escapes.....tricks<br />  the dance company and<br />      disguises as Kamsan and meets IsanaPandithar and<br />  meets Kundavai and delivers<br />      the message!!!!!<br />     <br />      I am sure you have read all this before going to<br />  the second volume.....<br />     <br />      would you say Karikala wasnt valiant because a<br />  asiriri laed him to<br />      Virapandiyan?<br />     <br />      Ilayapallavan looses his sword to Kanjana<br />  devi.....is saved from the<br />      courts of Kalinga by Kanjana Devi.....is saved<br />  from death from the horses by<br />      Amir.....but he is alrger than life<br />     <br />      please for heavens sake stop calling him an<br />  idiot because however Kalki<br />      potrays him he was a great statsman and<br />  admistrater of the Mideaval Chola<br />      empire He was Rajendra&#39;s Samandhanayakar for<br />  gods sake<br />      regards<br />     <br />      Sri<br />     <br />      *Arun Krishnan *<br />  wrote:<br />     <br />      Well I am rereading it now.. &#40;<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> I mean&#41;.. and<br />  started the second<br />      book.. so Vanthiyathevan goes to Kodikkarai..<br />  meets Poonguzhali... falls<br />      into a ditch... is rescued by her.. she tells<br />  him about people looking for<br />      him..
