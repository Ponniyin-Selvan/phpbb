			<div class="content">The kurunthogai is compilation of love - Valli over Lord muruga. <br />Kura valli is she who rules over nature in its very native form.<br /><br />I guess it has been looked over in very literal meanings. When I read <br />these lines, my heart melted for the amount of love in bhakti Valli <br />has displayed. (please read the song kalki wrote on murugan in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> <br />also). Great works which if read properly will bring tears in any <br />devotee.<br /><br />Here is what I interpret: <br />the guy who stole my heart, it is none but He, He said he will come <br />and take me, and I wait here on that, but his words were not true.<br />The girl who guards the corn fields (Valli), waits for you on her <br />little green feet as would a heron that waits upstream, you took her <br />in or blended her in you.<br />Note: <br />It is said that Lord muruga was so deep in love with Valli that He <br />fell at her feet, something He has never done to any other, but <br />grants that wish to her bhakti. <br />Thirupugazh song Aruthi vazhvodu: <br />Isaitha naavinan ithanodu kurra magal iru paatham.<br /><br />Valli is presented in green color and she is the guardian of corn <br />fields. (Again there is a philosophical meaning for both Valli and <br />the corn fields).<br /><br />While reading Mr.Hart's translations, i am wondering how Kapilar's <br />genius can also be read in very simple worldly terms. <br />Mr.Hart.... your words on our Valli and her love for our Lord, are <br />heart breaking and misleading.<br /><br />I should insist that western people unless they understand the <br />intricacies of our beliefs, will come out with such translations.<br /><br />I feel I can only quote paana pathirar's words t the Lord 'Intha <br />ooruku pazhi nernthal unakindri yenakkilai'.<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/03/16/akam-poem-from-<br />kurunthokai-english-translation/<br />  <br />  Kurunthokai 25<br />  <br />  There was no one there,<br />  <br />  only that man <br />  <br />  who is like thief.<br />  <br />  If he lies, what can I do?<br />  <br />  With little green legs like millet stalks,<br />  <br />  a heron searched for eels in the running water<br />  <br />  when he took me.<br />  <br />  Kapilar<br />  <br />  &#40;Translated by George L.

			<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br />This is a very very detailed reply to prove that stance of Mr.Ravi<br />is not true with regards to either Kurunthokai or Gorge L Hart.<br /><br />1. I am posting here 4 other translations of various scholars of the<br />same poem,<br /><br />About the Translator<br />A.K.Ramanujan, He is considered one of the best translators in this<br />world. His translation are very famous world wide and most scholars<br />who took up Tamil research were inspired by his translations. His<br />works are so very acknowledged that an Award called A.K.Ramanujan<br />award is instituted and awarded to best translated work every year.<br />A.K. Ramanujan is popularly know for his work The Interior Landscape<br />which is selected Translation of Kurunthokai.His verse on Red earth<br />and water is very famous and discussed already in this forum.If Tamil<br />is known to the western world he is one of the most important factor<br />for it.<br />I am posting his translation of this poem<br /><br />Only the thief was there,no one else<br />and if he should lie, what can I do?<br />There was only <br />a thin legged heron standing<br />on legs as millet stems<br />and looking<br />for lampreys<br />in the running water<br />when he took me.<br />(A.K.Ramanujan,The Interior Landscape)<br /><br />Kamil V Zvelebil, he is also another renowned scholar, google his name<br />you will know everything you need about him. I am quoting his<br />translation below,<br /><br />No one was there but he, <br />the thief.<br />If he denies it, what shall we I do?<br />Only a heron stood by ,<br />its thin gold legs like millet stalks<br />eyeing the aral fish,<br />in the gliding water <br />on the day<br />he took me.<br />(Kamil V Zvelebil,Smile of Murugan)<br /><br />C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature is considered to be<br />one of the great works on Tamil history. I am quoting their<br />translation below,<br /><br />No one else was there, only he the thief;<br />should he be false,what shall I do?<br />And when we met, there was in our sight<br />Only the stork , with legs as thin as wisp of straw,<br />That into gliding water peered for prey.<br />( C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature)<br /><br />This is another translation which is available, which I am posting below,<br /><br />There were no witness <br />when he embraced me.<br />(If he leaves me, now what can I do?)<br />Only the heron stood by,<br />its thin gold legs like millet stalks,<br />eeying the aaral fish<br />in the flowing water.<br />(E.Annamaalai - H.Schiffman,Mahfil)<br /><br /><br />These are translation of world renowned Tamil Scholars and all of<br />their translation are similar to Gorge L Hart and means the following: <br />The heroine who has had sexual union with her lover is worried whether<br />he would deny that affair and cheat her.<br /><br />I am also quoting the word by word meaning of Tamil verse below<br /><br />who- ever(was)not(there) only -he the thief<br />he that if- denies I what shall-I-do<br />millet-stalk-like small - green leg(s)- of<br />running- water aral(fish) seeking<br />heron was alone (he) took (me) day.<br />(Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan)   <br /><br /><br />2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of 205<br />poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written by<br />Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of the<br />these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai was love<br />between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi is<br />daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer's interpretation and<br />commentary on Kurunthokai.<br /><br />3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of Murugan<br />and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />allusions point to.<br /><br />4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, where the<br />hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to Murugan. This<br />a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of Kurunthokai are<br />common people and not Murugan and Valli.<br /><br />Kurunthokai 1<br />Making the field red with his killing<br /><br />he crushes demons.<br /><br />He has red shafted arrows,<br /><br />red -tusked elephants,<br /><br />whirling battle anklets.<br /><br />This hill belongs to Murugan<br /><br />and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.<br /><br />Tipput Tolar<br /><br />(Translated by George L. Hart)<br /><br />The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift of red<br />kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have him.In this<br />poem she refuses his offering(based on commentary of U V Sa).<br /><br />4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as God who<br />caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , when u<br />finish reading it every one would surely like to question Mr.Ravi's<br />interpretations.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05 ... esickness/</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person who try<br />their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had intensive<br />training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are specially<br />trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and intensive<br />training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how Mr.<br />Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars who have<br />undergone training to read these literatures.<br /><br />6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most respected<br />persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical Language.<br />He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can commit so<br />grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont think he<br />would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the letter<br />he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a classical Language.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-tamil-as.html">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/ ... il-as.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />produce the following: <br />1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under consideration<br />2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his own<br />interpretation.<br />3. Is there any written source which has been critically examined to<br />support his claim.<br />4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has discussion<br />of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.<br /><br />I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his reply. I<br />simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Vairam<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay<br />  <br />  I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a person <br />  who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his Tamil <br />  skill, his knowledge is amazing.<br />   <br />  But that does not mean that there is only one translation and it <br />  means what he said.

Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of 205<br />  poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written by<br />  Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of the<br />  these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai was <br />love<br />  between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi is<br />  daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer&#39;s interpretation and<br />  commentary on Kurunthokai.<br />  <br />  3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of Murugan<br />  and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />  allusions point to.<br />  <br />  4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, where <br />the<br />  hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to Murugan. <br />This<br />  a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of Kurunthokai <br />are<br />  common people and not Murugan and Valli.<br />  <br />  Kurunthokai 1<br />  Making the field red with his killing<br />  <br />  he crushes demons.<br />  <br />  He has red shafted arrows,<br />  <br />  red -tusked elephants,<br />  <br />  whirling battle anklets.<br />  <br />  This hill belongs to Murugan<br />  <br />  and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.<br />  <br />  Tipput Tolar<br />  <br />  &#40;Translated by George L. Hart&#41;<br />  <br />  The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift of <br />red<br />  kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have him.In <br />this<br />  poem she refuses his offering&#40;based on commentary of U V Sa&#41;.<br />  <br />  4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as God <br />who<br />  caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />when u<br />  finish reading it every one would surely like to question Mr.Ravi&#39;s<br />  interpretations.<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05 ... esickness/</a><!-- m --> <br />  <br />  5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person who <br />try<br />  their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />intensive<br />  training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are specially<br />  trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and intensive<br />  training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how Mr.<br />  Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars who <br />have<br />  undergone training to read these literatures.<br />  <br />  6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most respected<br />  persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />  letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />Language.<br />  He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />commit so<br />  grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont think <br />he<br />  would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />letter<br />  he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a classical <br />Language.<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/ ... status-of-</a><!-- m --><br />tamil-as.html<br />  <br />  <br />  These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />  I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />  produce the following: <br />  1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under consideration<br />  2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />  2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his <br />own<br />  interpretation.<br />  3. Is there any written source which has been critically examined <br />to<br />  support his claim.<br />  4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />discussion<br />  of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.<br />  <br />  I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />reply.

There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as God <br />  who<br />    caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />  when u<br />    finish reading it every one would surely like to question Mr.Ravi&#39;s<br />    interpretations.<br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05 ... esickness/</a><!-- m --> <br />    <br />    5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person who <br />  try<br />    their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />  intensive<br />    training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are specially<br />    trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and intensive<br />    training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how Mr.<br />    Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars who <br />  have<br />    undergone training to read these literatures.<br />    <br />    6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most respected<br />    persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />    letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />  Language.<br />    He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />  commit so<br />    grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont think <br />  he<br />    would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />  letter<br />    he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a classical <br />  Language.<br />    <br />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/ ... status-of-</a><!-- m --><br />  tamil-as.html<br />    <br />    <br />    These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />    I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />    produce the following: <br />    1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under consideration<br />    2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />    2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his <br />  own<br />    interpretation.<br />    3. Is there any written source which has been critically examined <br />  to<br />    support his claim.<br />    4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />  discussion<br />    of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.<br />    <br />    I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />  reply. I<br />    simply cannot accept &#39; Fact becomes myth&#39; story.<br />    <br />    Thank you.<br />    <br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Vairam<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Ravi"  wrote: <br />     <br />      Dear Vijay<br />      <br />      I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a <br />  person <br />      who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his <br />  Tamil <br />      skill, his knowledge is amazing.<br />       <br />      But that does not mean that there is only one translation and it <br />      means what he said.

			<div class="content">Ravi, please don't mistake, I have enjoyed both yours<br />and Thiru Vairam's postings immensely. Interpretation<br />of poetry is very much a question of the individual<br />and especially if the poet is no longer alive it is<br />possible to come with several interpretations it that<br />the poet may not have even imagined. I sometimes have<br />issues with poetry lovers over extending the original<br />and also with some of us thinking spiritual lovers do<br />not have same/similar emotions are human lovers.
