Pandya spies &#40; however we know that contrary to kalki&#39;s<br />    portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule<br />  under<br />    Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the<br />udayakudi<br />    inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....&#41;- so they<br />  were<br />    mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!<br />   <br />    2&#41; Uttama/sembian madevi &#40; wrongfully denied the throne&#41; - he<br />did<br />    not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his<br />15<br />    years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the<br />kingdom<br />    was very much flourishing under his rule &#40;

would have provided<br />    lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government<br />was<br />    responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression.<br />If<br />    the government increases its spending, then the citizens are<br />    encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation.<br />    People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb<br />back<br />  up<br />    to normal.&#41; Despite all this he had to give up his throne after<br />15<br />    years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes<br />to<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />    line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />    something...or was it a compromise formula reached between <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />and<br />    Uttama.<br />   <br />    3&#41; <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was war hungry - short<br />    tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />    manipulated <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. from kalki&#39;s portrayal Kundavai seems to have no<br />    love lost for her elder brother &#40; she blames it on his<br />horoscope&#41;.<br />   <br />    Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />    maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> will be<br />  next<br />    in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back<br />  when<br />    <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> came on....<br />   <br />    my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />    services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th<br />  year<br />    of uc rule, which made <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> take over - since they were royality,<br />he<br />    was just asked to resign and go..&#40;

			<div class="content">Hi Madhu;<br /><br />Super conspiracy theory. Ive already bought this up and this theory has been<br />trashed by this group. Im also of the opinion <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the ONLY person in that<br />koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew<br />he could get away with it.<br />We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a saint but there<br />was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had<br />to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja"<br />with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>still alive. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had<br />been alive. Of all the motives <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>'s and Nandhini's seem the most probable.<br />But Nandhini was present when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered and she is not that stupid!!<br />That eliminates her. By the process of elimination <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the culprit.<br />Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually<br />thrashed by historians.<br />I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group.<br />This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />There is no evidence on how <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 7/20/07, Madhu Saravana Sibi Govindan  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I&#39;m very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed here<br />  before:<br />  could <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK?

			<div class="content">Hey,<br /><br />I think the flaw in the theory is the process of elimination. If he<br />had everything to gain<br />why wait for 15 years, it is not 1 or 2. Nobody could foresee a period<br />15 years. And<br />he has also led many war campaign where you could never tell you are<br />going to come<br />alive. If he had conspired why risk his life in the war for 15 years,<br />he could have become<br />directly become the king.<br /><br />Yeah, there is nothing here to prove that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> has not involved in the<br />murder, just to<br />state the contradiction in the argument.<br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />On 7/20/07, Rahul dhinakaran  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Madhu;<br /> <br />  Super conspiracy theory. Ive already bought this up and this theory has been trashed by this group. Im also of the opinion <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the ONLY person in that koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew he could get away with it.<br />  We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a saint but there was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja" with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>still alive. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had been alive. Of all the motives <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>&#39;s and Nandhini&#39;s seem the most probable. But Nandhini was present when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered and she is not that stupid!! That eliminates her. By the process of elimination <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> is the culprit. Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually thrashed by historians.<br />  I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group. This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />  There is no evidence on how <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>.<br /> <br />  Regards<br />  Rahul<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  On 7/20/07, Madhu Saravana Sibi Govindan  wrote:<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    I&#39;m very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed here before:<br />    could <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK? He had everything to<br />    gain from the murder. He could get a good name by appointing/letting others<br />    appoint Uttama, thereby diverting attention from him. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> also knew that Uttama<br />    would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he wanted. Later on, when <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym><br />    came to power, he punished a few suspicious characters like Ravidasan.<br />   <br />    Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> as portrayed by Kalki. But, is it<br />    plausible? Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, who is shrewd and who could have<br />    pulled off something like the plot above.<br />   <br />    What do others think?<br />   <br />    G.Sibi<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />    On 7/18/07, kndavai  wrote:<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Hey,<br />      Actually some important politician or one of the family members may<br />      invovled in this <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>murder.Surely RajaRaja did know the truth.But not<br />      everyone in that period.<br />     <br />      So Rajaraja like to close this chapter without the knowledge of<br />      others.If he published those information,he may thought it will be a<br />      blackmark of cholas.

			<div class="content">hi,<br /><br />please refer previous posts on ephigraphical evidences - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was a <br />popular prince, the throne was served to him on a plate - but he let <br />go - and their reading - especially of <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym>. However keeping aside <br />these, the options are<br /><br />1. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> consipires and kills AK - however, this argument is weak- <br />since it would have been much easy for him to put the blame of UC, <br />Ravidasan and co then and there - no tv, internet email then - he <br />could have ensured swift execution, a few tom tommers annoucing to <br />the public and that would have been it - why wait for 15 years<br /><br />2. assume <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and UC - are heading the two groups. both collude and <br />bump AK. Both groups equally pitted - so inorder not to split the <br />kingdom, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> agrees to step aside with a compromise formula - that <br />he will rule after Uc. But then the flaw is - UC would have gained <br />more power during 15 years of rule and also <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was away on so many <br />battles - a 15 year time frame is too large for those days.. so why <br />didnt UC blood line not follow him and why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was allowed to come <br />to power after UC. ( again matter of contention - as Madurantaka - <br />said be he son of Uc and held important adminstrative positions in <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> rule, is he the son on UC) - refer prev threads in the group on <br />this.<br /><br />3. assume UC bumped of AK. his faction more powerful than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> - so <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> gives way, saying let bygones be bygones - lets not wash dirty <br />linen in public - you rule, but after you i will be in - again weak <br />argument on the succession issue. Uc ruled well - general peace and <br />prosperity, temple building etc - must have got enough good will <br />among the masses to ensure his lineage ruled. also could have made <br />sure <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> fades away into insignificane. <br /><br />4. Assume none knew who bumped off AK -UC and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> both vie for the <br />throne - both faction equally matched. hence <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> steps aside and <br />since he thought it was pandya abuthivigal and goes after them. in <br />between - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> uncovers the plot that Uc and gang did it - UC is <br />served an ultimatum, his family disowns him, but he is allowed to <br />keep his honor intact - asked to accquit the throne and go away ( or <br />bumped off). <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> assumes power and nails the rest of the <br />conspirators.<br /><br />there is another twist to this plot, which <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> seems to have <br />ignored - <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> takes the coronation name of Madurantakan II, why <br />would he do it - ie take the tranished name of the man who killed <br />his own uncle.<br /><br />5. Ravidasan and gang polish of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>on behalf of pandiyan. UC and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> <br />both innocent. however, none of the assasins are caught. Kundavai <br />and Anirudhar fear for the life of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> under these circumstances - <br />hence put up UC to the throne - while <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> moves around freely and <br />cleans up the country. find who the conspirators are - once they <br />are exposed, he comes to power sending off UC to his pilgrimage and <br />irai pani - gets the throne and convicts the gang..<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Madhu Saravana Sibi <br />Govindan"  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I&#39;m very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed <br />here<br />  before:<br />  could <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK?

He could get a good name by <br />appointing/letting others<br />  appoint Uttama, thereby diverting attention from him. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> also <br />knew that<br />  Uttama<br />  would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he <br />wanted.

			<div class="content">I think <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> assumed the title of Madurantakan to denote that he was the terminator of Pandyas(Madurai).<br /><br />"Vijay Kumar .S"  wrote: hi,<br /><br />please refer previous posts on ephigraphical evidences - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was a<br />popular prince, the throne was served to him on a plate - but he let<br />go - and their reading - especially of <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym>. However keeping aside<br />these, the options are<br /><br />1. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> consipires and kills AK - however, this argument is weak-<br />since it would have been much easy for him to put the blame of UC,<br />Ravidasan and co then and there - no tv, internet email then - he<br />could have ensured swift execution, a few tom tommers annoucing to<br />the public and that would have been it - why wait for 15 years<br /><br />2. assume <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and UC - are heading the two groups. both collude and<br />bump AK. Both groups equally pitted - so inorder not to split the<br />kingdom, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> agrees to step aside with a compromise formula - that<br />he will rule after Uc. But then the flaw is - UC would have gained<br />more power during 15 years of rule and also <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was away on so many<br />battles - a 15 year time frame is too large for those days.. so why<br />didnt UC blood line not follow him and why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> was allowed to come<br />to power after UC. ( again matter of contention - as Madurantaka -<br />said be he son of Uc and held important adminstrative positions in<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> rule, is he the son on UC) - refer prev threads in the group on<br />this.<br /><br />3. assume UC bumped of AK. his faction more powerful than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> - so<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> gives way, saying let bygones be bygones - lets not wash dirty<br />linen in public - you rule, but after you i will be in - again weak<br />argument on the succession issue. Uc ruled well - general peace and<br />prosperity, temple building etc - must have got enough good will<br />among the masses to ensure his lineage ruled. also could have made<br />sure <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> fades away into insignificane.<br /><br />4. Assume none knew who bumped off AK -UC and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> both vie for the<br />throne - both faction equally matched. hence <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> steps aside and<br />since he thought it was pandya abuthivigal and goes after them. in<br />between - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> uncovers the plot that Uc and gang did it - UC is<br />served an ultimatum, his family disowns him, but he is allowed to<br />keep his honor intact - asked to accquit the throne and go away ( or<br />bumped off). <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> assumes power and nails the rest of the<br />conspirators.<br /><br />there is another twist to this plot, which <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri">KAN</acronym> seems to have<br />ignored - <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> takes the coronation name of Madurantakan II, why<br />would he do it - ie take the tranished name of the man who killed<br />his own uncle.<br /><br />5. Ravidasan and gang polish of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>on behalf of pandiyan. UC and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym><br />both innocent. however, none of the assasins are caught. Kundavai<br />and Anirudhar fear for the life of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> under these circumstances -<br />hence put up UC to the throne - while <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> moves around freely and<br />cleans up the country. find who the conspirators are - once they<br />are exposed, he comes to power sending off UC to his pilgrimage and<br />irai pani - gets the throne and convicts the gang..<br /><br />vj<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Madhu Saravana Sibi<br />Govindan" wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I&#39;m very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed<br />here<br />  before:<br />  could <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK?

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="muncited"><div>aditya had many enemies. the list of those wanting to murder him <br />  could have been endless.<br />  venketesh</div></blockquote>Very true - seems to be the case with most ruthless warriors...<br /><br />read this about genghis khan's death...<br /><br />On August 18, 1227, during his last campaign against the coalition <br />of Jin Dynasty and Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The reason for <br />his death is uncertain. The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle alleges he <br />was killed by the Tanguts. There are persistent folktales that a <br />Tangut princess, to avenge her people and prevent her rape, <br />castrated him with a knife hidden inside her and that he never <br />recovered.
