			<div class="content">Find replace_ Caesar with AK, Brutus n others with nandhini, <br />ravidasan, soman etc etc , the priests with kudanthai josier.....in <br />this account of Assasination of Caesar:<br /><br />Nicolaus of Damascus wrote his account of the murder of Caesar a few <br />years after the event. He was not actually present when the <br />assassination occurred but had the opportunity to speak with those <br />who were. He was a friend of Herod the Great and gathered his <br />information during a visit to Rome. His account is thought to be <br />reliable. <br /><br />The Plan: <br /><br />"The conspirators never met openly, but they assembled a few at a <br />time in each others' homes. There were many discussions and <br />proposals, as might be expected, while they investigated how and <br />where to execute their design. Some suggested that they should make <br />the attempt as he was going along the Sacred Way, which was one of <br />his favorite walks. Another idea was for it to be done at the <br />elections during which he bad to cross a bridge to appoint the <br />magistrates in the Campus Martius; they should draw lots for some to <br />push him from the bridge and for others to run up and kill him. A <br />third plan was to wait for a coming gladiatorial show. The advantage <br />of that would be that, because of the show, no suspicion would be <br />aroused if arms were seen prepared for the attempt. But the majority <br />opinion favored killing him while he sat in the Senate, where he <br />would be by himself since non-Senators would not be admitted, and <br />where the many conspirators could hide their daggers beneath their <br />togas. This plan won the day." <br /><br />Brutus Persuades Caesar to Ignore his Apprehensions: <br /><br />"...his friends were alarmed at certain rumors and tried to stop him <br />going to the Senate-house, as did his doctors, for he was suffering <br />from one of his occasional dizzy spells. His wife, Calpurnia, <br />especially, who was frightened by some visions in her dreams, clung <br />to him and said that she would not let him go out that day. But <br />Brutus, one of the conspirators who was then thought of as a firm <br />friend, came up and said, 'What is this, Caesar? Are you a man to <br />pay attention to a woman's dreams and the idle gossip of stupid men, <br />and to insult the Senate by not going out, although it has honored <br />you and has been specially summoned by you? But listen to me, cast <br />aside the forebodings of all these people, and come. The Senate has <br />been in session waiting for you since early this morning.' This <br />swayed Caesar and he left." <br /><br />Bad Omens: <br /><br />"Before he entered the chamber, the priests brought up the victims <br />for him to make what was to be his last sacrifice. The omens were <br />clearly unfavorable. After this unsuccessful sacrifice, the priests <br />made repeated other ones, to see if anything more propitious might <br />appear than what had already been revealed to them. In the end they <br />said that they could not clearly see the divine intent, for there <br />was some transparent, malignant spirit hidden in the victims. Caesar <br />was annoyed and abandoned divination till sunset, though the priests <br />continued all the more with their efforts. <br /><br />Those of the murderers present were delighted at all this, though <br />Caesar's friends asked him to put off the meeting of the Senate for <br />that day because of what the priests had said, and he agreed to do <br />this. But some attendants came up, calling him and saying that the <br />Senate was full. He glanced at his friends, but Brutus approached <br />him again and said, 'Come, good sir, pay no attention to the <br />babblings of these men, and do not postpone what Caesar and his <br />mighty power has seen fit to arrange. Make your own courage your <br />favorable omen.' He convinced Caesar with these words, took him by <br />the right hand, and led him to the Senate which was quite near. <br />Caesar followed in silence." <br /><br />The Attack: <br /><br />"The Senate rose in respect for his position when they saw him <br />entering. Those who were to have part in the plot stood near him. <br />Right next to him went Tillius Cimber, whose brother had been exiled <br />by Caesar. Under pretext of a humble request on behalf of this <br />brother, Cimber approached and grasped the mantle of his toga, <br />seeming to want to make a more positive move with his hands upon <br />Caesar. Caesar wanted to get up and use his hands, but was prevented <br />by Cimber and became exceedingly annoyed. <br /><br />That was the moment for the men to set to work. All quickly <br />unsheathed their daggers and rushed at him. First Servilius Casca <br />struck him with the point of the blade on the left shoulder a little <br />above the collar-bone. He had been aiming for that, but in the <br />excitement he missed. Caesar rose to defend himself, and in the <br />uproar Casca shouted out in Greek to his brother. The latter heard <br />him and drove his sword into the ribs. After a moment, Cassius made <br />a slash at his face, and Decimus Brutus pierced him in the side. <br />While Cassius Longinus was trying to give him another blow he missed <br />and struck Marcus Brutus on the hand. Minucius also hit out at <br />Caesar and hit Rubrius in the thigh. They were just like men doing <br />battle against him. <br /><br />Under the mass of wounds, he fell at the foot of Pompey's statue. <br />Everyone wanted to seem to have had some part in the murder, and <br />there was not one of them who failed to strike his body as it lay <br />there, until, wounded thirty-five times, he breathed his last.

			<div class="content">I am not sure what generated Nandini but there was a character very similar to her in the movie Manohara released in 1954. Vasantha Sena was in all modes same as Nandhini.<br />Those who have seen Manohara would know this person, also equally intriguing is the fact that Nandini being a fictional frame and Vasantha Sena being a fictional person too, both stories are based out of chola dynasty!<br /><br />-- Ravi<br /><br />Sivapathasekaran  wrote: --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote:<br /><br />Probably that is how Klki also would have visualised and planned.<br /><br />Very nice line of thinking..<br /><br />Vijay, Great Writers keep in mind the Visul Medium while writing /<br />characterising ..fitting characters also with contemporary legends.<br /><br />Kalki was no exception since his Novel did figure in the Visual<br />medium. Therefore the Villiany - Glamorous - comical<br />charecterisations - with Main Hero / Heroine, Supporting Hero /<br />Heroine.... will leave this at it.<br /><br />AK's murder ... ! ? !<br /><br />Whenever you find time, pls earlier mails on this subject..<br /><br />There appears to be MORE to it.. may be MUCH MORE..<br /><br />sps</div>
