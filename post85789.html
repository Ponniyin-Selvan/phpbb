			<div class="content">1. There has definitely been religious literature, but saying that<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>without religion literaure loses its spirit is not only being<br />  chauvinistic but also being plain ignorant. Thirukkural is still<br />  amazing literature without the first ten lines, if you can&#39;t<br />  appreciate it, I really have nothing more to say.</div></blockquote>If you think thirukural has religion only in its<br />first ten kurals then you havent read it fully.Thirukural is full of<br />vedic concepts and hindu gods.even in inbathupal lord thirumal is<br />mentioned as "tamarai kannan".Tirukural is full of vedic concepts<br />like yagnas,pithru dharma,panchagni and so on.<br /><br />There is no religion in the sonnets of Shakespeare or the verses of<br />Shelley or Keats<br />I spoke only about tamil.Not any other language.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>2. I am not accusing you of anything. I said "I am not very<br />tolerant of religious conservatism". Its me, not you. I simply</div></blockquote>cannot understand people who take literally whatever is said in<br />some book ages ago and use that to justify 'anything they want'(not<br />everything, mind you.<br />Even tirukural was written ages ago.It is<br />hailed as tamil vedam.Whatever is there in veda is in tirukural<br />also.A book is old or new doesnt matter.how we can benefit from it<br />matters.Various vedic concepts like respecting parents,pathivratha<br />dharma are still guiding hindu society.Somebooks and concepts have<br />no age.<br /><br />"Nowadays, since its not politically correct, we will let<br />low castes enter the temple though its mentioned in the same holy<br />books but but we will agree with the book on other kinds of<br />nonsense like 'how to not let certain biologically impure actresses<br />into the temple'). I just find it interesting that they are not<br />capable of applying their (God-given?) brians and for some reason,<br />their standard of comparison is some other religion which does the<br />same thing! As I said, I find it difficult to converse with people<br />like that, so its my fault; I am not accusing you of anything"<br /><br />In which veda has it been said that low castes should<br />be prevented from entering the temple?when US was at its height of<br />slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean that<br />bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in all<br />religions.It happened in hinduism also.Thirupanalvar was a dalit and<br />he was carried by sri rangam bhramins in their shoulders as a<br />punishment for their not allowing him into temple.<br /><br />why should my religion compare itself with other<br />religions and import their standards?we have no such necessity.we<br />dont see any such imitable qualities in any other religion which<br />isnt there in ours.Hinduism has nothing to learn from anybody.It is<br />the guru for the whole universe.<br /><br />"Food for thought: Couldn't resist this one -<br />One man one wife was also a ramayan age standard.Do we give it up<br />since its old?No.'One woman, five husbands is Mahabharatha<br />standards' - why don't we start living that way from now on?"<br /><br />polyandry has been allowed under special circumstances in<br />hinduism.Polygyny and polygamy are also allowed under special<br />circumstances.monogomy is the general norm and polygamy is a special<br />norm valid in ceratain occasions.what is the big deal here?I dont<br />understand.when a society can allow polygyny whats wrong in allowing<br />polyandry too?</div>

			<div class="content">1) Kural never preaches casteism.<br /><br />"Marapinum othukollal agum,PAARPAN PIRAPOLUKKAM kundra kedum"<br /><br />"ANDHANAR enbor aravor,evvuyirkum sendhanmai poondolugalan"<br /><br />"aa payan kundrum,ARUTHOLILOR NOOL marappar,kavalan kaavan<br />enin"<br /><br />Arutholilor indicates bhramins.Vedas called them as "shatkarma<br />nirathar" meaning bhramins have 6 duties.Valluvar translated it as<br />arutholilor(people with 6 duties).He also says "NOOL (vedas)<br />marappar" indicating that bhramins forgeting vedas is an undesirable<br />thing.<br /><br /><br />what do these kurals mean?<br /><br />2) Kural treats all the lives in same way. i.e. There is no animal<br />considered as holy animal.<br /><br />Valluvar indicates what are the consequences of a bad ruler as<br />follows.He starts of with cows "Aa payan kundrum" and continues it<br />with "arutholilor nool marappar" indicating that the greatest bad<br />thing that can happen when a king is bad is "cows reducing their<br />milk secretion".The second badest thing is bhramins forgeting<br />vedas.He doesnt even talk about law and order here.These two things<br />concern him more than anything.See how he puts cows even before<br />bhramins and vedas.<br /><br />"AA payan kundrum arutholilor nool marappar kavalan kaavan enin"<br /><br /><br />3) There is "tamarai kannaan ulagam" in 1103rd kural. If it is<br />taken as thirumal, he is clearly not praising thirumal.<br /><br />Is he not?"Tamarai kannan"--see the words.He<br />is not just praising krishna.He is simply adoring the beauty of the<br />eyes of narayana in a poetic way.In all other sangam literatures<br />narayana is called as hari and thirumal.But here valluvar cajoles<br />him like a kid.Why did not valluvar just say "thiruaml vaal ulagu"<br />or even shortly as "vaikunda"?I only see valluvar konjufying krishna<br />as his kid in this kural.<br /><br />Even leaving apart this sentimental view of<br />mine that kural says "Is the world of hari better than this<br />woman?".Here too i see him glorifying vaikunda.Even kambar used this<br />technique.When bharatha is about to jump in fire kousalya stops him<br />and says "I can live withour Ram,but not without you.PALAKODI<br />RAMANUM unakku inayagan".See how kambar hailes baratha as.Ramayanam<br />is about rama.The book itself contains ramas name.Rama is none other<br />than thirumal.Kambar is the staunchest devotee of narasimma.Such a<br />man hails bharatha as "palakodi ramanum unakku inayagan".Does this<br />mean that kambar is not praising rama?when you priase somebody you<br />will compare them only with the thing you value the most.For kambar<br />it was ram.For valluvar it was narayana.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4) It treats all the people in same way. In vedas its not the case.<br /><br />Is it so?Please show such vedic quotes<br />where it says people are inferior?<br /><br />"" From: many sangam literatures When I omit religion, I can see many<br />things. It is just how u look at the things.""<br /><br />Go nowhere.See thirukural.He sung 3<br />concepts aram,porul and inbam.He placed aram in front of everything<br />else.And how does he start even the arathupal?He starts off with<br />praying to god.And which is the god whom he worships first?Its his<br />mother.Then he proceeds to worship his father.Then in the next 9<br />kurals he worships god.Then he narrates aram in the next chapters.<br /><br />He wanted us to worship god first,seek aram next,seek porul<br />afterwards and seek inbam at the end.This is his hierarchy.If you<br />are being selective in following him its not his mistake.<br /><br />" I am a hindu by birth and living in TN. I can see how a fellow man<br />is treated by the name of caste. Everybody agrees that casteism is<br />a bad thing. But how many people have given up the caste? Still<br />majority of people r proud to identify themself with their caste<br />name. Still casteism plays a major role in majority of hindus<br />life. I cant be proud to call myself as hindu when I see a fellow<br />man suffers by the name of religion.In my opinion religion just<br />divides people."""<br /><br />what is the thing that unites people then?Marx<br />tried it by removing all hierarchies in the society and he failed<br />badly and his followers established the most ruthless regime in the<br />process.Hierarchies will not disappear just by you wishing them to<br />disappear.Saying "religion divides people" is fashionable<br />nowadays.Income,age,sex,occupation,language,country..so many things<br />do the same thing.Why not remove all this?<br /><br />Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you wont see<br />the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the job you<br />do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was later<br />sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" and which later was<br />adapated as the motto of DMK.So DMK in end hailed vedic concept as<br />its motto.How funny can things become.</div>

			<div class="content">I have refrained from entering into the current "debate" till now.<br />However, I would like to suggest that if "religion" is being<br />discussed, then we do it as a whole and not just focussed on Hinduism.<br />For example, I agree caste is bad and that it is a blight on Hinduism.<br />Great.. However, is it any worse than other religions dividing the<br />entire world into "believers" and "heathens/kafirs"?<br /><br />The problem I have with the DK/DMK crowd, is that all their criticism<br />is about Hinduism. They don't seem to extend their arguments to other<br />religions. A possible reason could be that Hindus tend to shrug off<br />criticisms about their religion whereas the Muslims and Xtians might<br />react in a more reactionary manner (I AM putting it very mildly here).<br /><br />There was this whole issue of people from other religions not being<br />allowed to enter temples. Heck, if you go to Saudi Arabia, you are not<br />even allowed to worship any of your gods in their country. How about<br />that?<br /><br />Let the arguments/counter arguments begin :p<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />On Fri, 12 Nov 2004 23:18:46 -0000, geethan  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>*********<br />    3&#41; There is "tamarai kannaan ulagam" in 1103rd kural.

Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.<br />    <br />    1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching <br />the<br />    heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the <br />SriÃ±gaya<br />    Vaitahavyas.<br />    2. The persons who pierced BrihatsÃ¢man, the descendant of <br />Angiras, the<br />    BrÃ¢hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their <br />offspring.<br />    3. They who spat upon the BrÃ¢hmana, who desired tribute from <br />him, they<br />    sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br />    4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches <br />does<br />    she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born <br />&#40;there&#41;.<br />    5. A cruel &#40;sacrilegious&#41; deed is her slaughter, her meat, when <br />eaten,<br />    is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a <br />crime<br />    against the Fathers.<br />    6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the<br />    BrÃ¢hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the BrÃ¢hmana is <br />oppressed.<br />    7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,<br />    two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor <br />of the<br />    Brahman.<br />    8. That &#40;kingdom&#41; surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship;<br />    misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a BrÃ¢hmana.<br />    9. The trees chase away with the words: &#39;do not come within our<br />    shade,&#39; him who covets the wealth that belongs to a BrÃ¢hmana, O <br />NÃ¢rada!<br />    10. King Varuna pronounced this &#40;to be&#41; poison, prepared by the <br />gods:<br />    no one who has devoured the cow of a BrÃ¢hmana retains the charge <br />of a<br />    kingdom.<br />    11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, <br />because<br />    they had injured the offspring of a BrÃ¢hmana, were ruined <br />irretrievably.<br />    12. The kÃ»dÃ®-plant &#40;Christ&#39;s thorn&#41; that wipes away the track &#40;of<br />    death&#41;, which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O <br />oppressor of<br />    Brahmans, the gods did declare &#40;to be&#41; thy couch.<br />    13. The tears which have rolled from &#40;the eyes of&#41; the oppressed<br />    &#40;Brahman&#41;, as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of <br />Brahmans,<br />    the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br />    14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they <br />moisten<br />    his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did <br />assign<br />    to thee as thy share of water.<br />    15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor <br />of<br />    Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not <br />guide<br />    his friend according to his will.<br />    <br />    Well, why these things r not for a normal human being? Why it is <br />only<br />    for brahmans? Isnt it partial?<br />    <br />    ***********************************<br />      Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you <br />wont see<br />      the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the job <br />you<br />      do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />      meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was <br />later<br />      sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" <br />    ************************************<br />    <br />    what r the followingg things about??<br />    ----<br />    Ã‚PASTAMBA PRASNA I, PATALA 1, KHANDA, 1.<br />    <br />    1. Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of merit <br />which<br />    form part of the customs of daily life, as they have been <br />settled by<br />    the agreement &#40;of those who know the law&#41;.<br />    <br />    2. The authority &#40;for these duties&#41; is the agreement of those <br />who know<br />    the law,<br />    <br />    3. And &#40;the authorities for the latter are&#41; the Vedas alone.<br />    <br />    4. &#40;There are&#41; four castes--BrÃ¢hmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and <br />SÃ»dras.<br />    <br />    5. Amongst these, each preceding &#40;caste&#41; is superior by birth to <br />the<br />    one following.<br />    <br />    6. &#40;For all these&#41;, excepting SÃ»dras and those who have <br />committed bad<br />    actions, &#40;are ordained&#41; the initiation, the study of the Veda, <br />and the<br />    kindling of<br />    ----<br />    <br />    Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />    beneficiaries. And the rest 30%&#40;dalits&#41; directly depended on the<br />    Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is <br />changing and<br />    majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.<br />    <br />    For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice casteism <br />in the<br />    name of religion.<br />    <br />    ****<br />    when US was at its height of<br />    slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean <br />that<br />    bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in all<br />    religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />    ***<br />    So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and other<br />    non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were&#40;are&#41; <br />criminals.<br />    Isnt it?<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Yahoo!

			<div class="content">dear priya<br /><br />If you understand that bhramins is not the name of a caste and is the name of saints it becomes simple.Many people like<br />viswamithra(ksathriya),vyasa(son of a fisherwoman),valmigi(hunter<br />and thief)became bhramins by meditation and prayer.In later days it<br />got twisted into castes by birth.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lord Krishna does not say guna and karma of previous life. In sloka<br />(XVIII.41) Lord Krishna says "Brahmana Kshatriya visham sudranam<br />chaparamtapa, karmani pravibhaktani svabhavaprabhavaigunaih."<br /><br /><br />But the same Krishna was quiet when Karna was insulted as Suthra Putra inspite of Knowing the truth.<br /><br />Drona was deemed to be a great brahman but he took the fingers off Ekaleva after refusing to teach him because he was not a Kshathriya and when he learnt the tricks by watching....this was to prevent any competetion for arjuna his favorite pupil.<br /><br />The learned Vidhura was never respected as a brahman becuse he was born to a sudra...he is even termed suthra puthra.....<br /><br />Kripacharya and Drona both refused karna permission to challenge arjuna because he was a sudra if the social strata was based on present birth and actions and there was no one as a ble as karna to be called Kshatriya...<br /><br />So all these examples are from Vyasa's mahabharat and though he says something in the voice of Krishna as Bhagvat Gita..its not what he has written in the book....<br /><br /><br />birth, son of an engineer is not an engineer by birth, son of an IFS<br />officer cannot be called an IFS officer by birth.<br /><br /><br />But Drona's son aswathama was given all the liberties of a brahman by birth??!!!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yahoo!

In vedas its not <br />the <br />  case.<br />       <br />        Is it so?Please show such vedic <br />quotes<br />        where it says people are inferior?<br />      ********************************************************<br />      <br />      Some quotes from atharva veda here,<br />      <br />      ***************<br />      IX.<br />      PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.<br />      <br />      V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.<br />      <br />      1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of <br />touching <br />  the<br />      heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the <br />  SriÃ±gaya<br />      Vaitahavyas.<br />      2. The persons who pierced BrihatsÃ¢man, the descendant of <br />  Angiras, the<br />      BrÃ¢hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their <br />  offspring.<br />      3. They who spat upon the BrÃ¢hmana, who desired tribute from <br />  him, they<br />      sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br />      4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches <br />  does<br />      she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born <br />  &#40;there&#41;.<br />      5. A cruel &#40;sacrilegious&#41; deed is her slaughter, her meat, <br />when <br />  eaten,<br />      is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a <br />  crime<br />      against the Fathers.<br />      6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy <br />the<br />      BrÃ¢hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the BrÃ¢hmana <br />is <br />  oppressed.<br />      7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,<br />      two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the <br />oppressor <br />  of the<br />      Brahman.<br />      8. That &#40;kingdom&#41; surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship;<br />      misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a <br />BrÃ¢hmana.<br />      9. The trees chase away with the words: &#39;do not come within our<br />      shade,&#39; him who covets the wealth that belongs to a BrÃ¢hmana, <br />O <br />  NÃ¢rada!<br />      10. King Varuna pronounced this &#40;to be&#41; poison, prepared by <br />the <br />  gods:<br />      no one who has devoured the cow of a BrÃ¢hmana retains the <br />charge <br />  of a<br />      kingdom.<br />      11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, <br />  because<br />      they had injured the offspring of a BrÃ¢hmana, were ruined <br />  irretrievably.<br />      12. The kÃ»dÃ®-plant &#40;Christ&#39;s thorn&#41; that wipes away the track <br />&#40;of<br />      death&#41;, which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O <br />  oppressor of<br />      Brahmans, the gods did declare &#40;to be&#41; thy couch.<br />      13. The tears which have rolled from &#40;the eyes of&#41; the <br />oppressed<br />      &#40;Brahman&#41;, as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of <br />  Brahmans,<br />      the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br />      14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they <br />  moisten<br />      his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods <br />did <br />  assign<br />      to thee as thy share of water.<br />      15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the <br />oppressor <br />  of<br />      Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not <br />  guide<br />      his friend according to his will.<br />      <br />      Well, why these things r not for a normal human being? Why it <br />is <br />  only<br />      for brahmans? Isnt it partial?<br />      <br />      ***********************************<br />        Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you <br />  wont see<br />        the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the <br />job <br />  you<br />        do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />        meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was <br />  later<br />        sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" <br />      ************************************<br />      <br />      what r the followingg things about??<br />      ----<br />      Ã‚PASTAMBA PRASNA I, PATALA 1, KHANDA, 1.<br />      <br />      1. Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of <br />merit <br />  which<br />      form part of the customs of daily life, as they have been <br />  settled by<br />      the agreement &#40;of those who know the law&#41;.<br />      <br />      2. The authority &#40;for these duties&#41; is the agreement of those <br />  who know<br />      the law,<br />      <br />      3. And &#40;the authorities for the latter are&#41; the Vedas alone.<br />      <br />      4. &#40;There are&#41; four castes--BrÃ¢hmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, <br />and <br />  SÃ»dras.<br />      <br />      5. Amongst these, each preceding &#40;caste&#41; is superior by birth <br />to <br />  the<br />      one following.<br />      <br />      6. &#40;For all these&#41;, excepting SÃ»dras and those who have <br />  committed bad<br />      actions, &#40;are ordained&#41; the initiation, the study of the Veda, <br />  and the<br />      kindling of<br />      ----<br />      <br />      Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />      beneficiaries. And the rest 30%&#40;dalits&#41; directly depended on <br />the<br />      Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is <br />  changing and<br />      majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.<br />      <br />      For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice casteism <br />  in the<br />      name of religion.<br />      <br />      ****<br />      when US was at its height of<br />      slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean <br />  that<br />      bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in <br />all<br />      religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />      ***<br />      So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and <br />other<br />      non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were&#40;are&#41; <br />  criminals.<br />      Isnt it?<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      Yahoo! Groups Links<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />    <br />    <br />    -- <br />    Arun Krishnan</div></blockquote></div>
