V. Ramakrishna Rao<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  The paper was presented at the 55th session of Indian History <br />  Congress, held at AligarhMuslimUniversity, Aligarh from December <br />20 <br />  to 22, 1994.<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  1.1. Introduction: Much has been written about the Religion, Gods, <br />  Goddesses and rituals of the ancient Tamils, but, there are few <br />  studies about different cults existed during the earliest times. <br />It <br />  may be interesting to know about the existence of the cult of the <br />  Sun, Moon, Fire, Mountain, Tree, Water etc as natural elements; <br />Sur, <br />  Anangu, Pavai, Surara Magalir, Varaiyara Magalir, Vanara Magalir, <br />  Oru mulai arutta Tiruma Unii, Salini, Pattini etc in anthromorphic <br />  forms; Ram, cattle, Cock, wall-lizard, snake etc in theriomorphic <br />  forms and so on. However, as the fire-cult is one of the earliest <br />  forms of religion of any society, a study of it reveals many <br />  interesting details in historical perspective. How the cult <br />  originated, developed, established, associated with other cults <br />and <br />  worship, incorporated and finally converted to other forms are <br />  analyzed and discussed based on the ancient Tamil literature, <br />  popularly known as "Sangam literature". Only Tolkappiyam &#40;not <br />  falling under the category of Sangam literature&#41;, Pattuppattu and <br />  Ettuttogai &#40;generally accepted by all as Sangam literature&#41; are <br />  taken for study as it covers the history of Tamils up to few <br />  centuries of the current era1. The anthropological evidence about <br />  fire goes back to megalithic and Neolithic periods &#40;c. 2500 BCE <br />and <br />  before&#41;. Epigraphical and Iconographic evidences belong to later <br />  period after first few centuries.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  1.2. Importance of fire: Fire has been an important factor, <br />  occupying almost all aspects of life, perhaps, from birth to death <br />  of man and even beyond. For man, fire is fear, all-pervading, <br />  adorable, effulgent, purifying, affecting, curing, life-producing, <br />  creator and destroyer. Man must have experienced, enjoyed, <br />suffered <br />  and understood these characters of fire, as his immediate <br />encounter <br />  has been the forms of Sun, Moon, lightning, volcano, forest fire <br />and <br />  of course, his own produced fire. All such experiences with the <br />  psychological processes with fire must have led him to start <br />  respecting, venerating and worshipping. The wide usage of fire for <br />  domestic, technical, religious and other secular purposes shows <br />its <br />  ready availability i.e., instant production of it by any <br />mechanical, <br />  or chemical process as found in the case of fire-stick, fire-stone <br />  or match-stock.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  2. The expressions used for fire in the ancient Tamil literature: <br />Ti <br />  &#40;general term&#41;, Eri &#40;burning fire&#41;, Teral &#40;fire, heat&#41;, Tanal <br />&#40;live <br />  coal&#41;, Kolli &#40;fire-brand&#41;, Kanal &#40;live-coal, heat&#41;, Kanali &#40;of <br />that <br />  type&#41;, Neruppu &#40;general term&#41;, Sudar &#40;single uniform flame&#41;, <br />Tazhal <br />  &#40;ember&#41;, Azhal, Gneli &#40;produced by bamboo&#41;, Gnezhili &#40;fire-brand&#41;, <br />  Imam &#40;pyre&#41;, Vilakku &#40;lamp&#41;, Alar &#40;of spreading nature&#41;, Kadir <br />  &#40;rays&#41;, are the words used to indicate fire of different nature. <br />  Alari, Kanthal, Vengai, Ambal, Kuvalai &#40;all flowers&#41;, Vanni, <br />  Kuvilam, Vengai &#40;trees&#41;; Erikkodi, Valli &#40;creepers&#41;; Gnayiru <br />&#40;Moon&#41;, <br />  Kodi &#40;Flaming&#41;; Ahuti &#40;sacred fire of yagna&#41;, Sudu &#40;heat, fire&#41;, <br />  Velvi &#40;yagna&#41;, Kalavelvi &#40;yagna of battle-field&#41;, Vettu &#40;perform <br />  yagna&#41; are used to denote indirectly, because of their nature, <br />  property, appearance, clour, form and association with fire. <br />Another <br />  important fact is that each of the above expressions has an <br />  alternative meaning denoting a red or bright star &#40;semmeen&#41; and <br />the <br />  Red planet &#40;Mars-Sevvai&#41; proving not only the origin of Solar <br />  system, but also the knowledge of man relating them.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  3. Fire and Domestic use: The significance of domestic application <br />  of fire is noted in the different expressions used. The cooking <br />fire <br />  is characteristically mentioned by the usual words &#40;as noted <br />above ? <br />  Puram.20:7-9; Agam.172:13; 237:9&#41;. Vayitrutti is used to signify <br />the <br />  stomach fire; Kavalti for protection; Kamatti to denote lust and <br />so <br />  on. Fire used for lightning is known with different names. Even <br />  lamps used for such purpose are known characteristically depending <br />  upon the size, shape and use ? Vilakku &#40;lamp&#41;, Vilakkam &#40;bigger <br />size <br />  lamp&#41;, Tipam &#40;lamp used for other purposes&#41;, Nantha vilakku <br />  &#40;continuously burning lamp&#41;,Madattolleri &#40;fire kept at the place <br />of <br />  chief or king&#41;, Ima vilakku &#40;lamps or fire kept at crematory <br />  grounds&#41;, Tundu &#40;lamps requires trimming&#41;, Sudar &#40;lamp with <br />uniform-<br />  single flame&#41;, Kadir &#40;lam with rays&#41;, Agal &#40;earthern lamp&#41;, <br />Tagazhi <br />  &#40;the bowl of a lamp&#41;, Pandali &#40;made of metal&#41;, Pavai vilakku &#40; <br />metal <br />  lamp in the form of woman carrying a lamp in hands&#41;. Fire is <br />  produced by the fire-drill and kept blowing through a tube <br />  &#40;Perum.178-79&#41;. Fire is also kept by Parppar, Andanar and the like <br />  for sacrificial purposes &#40;Puram.2:23; Pari.5:42; Kali.69:5&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  4. Fire and Technology: For the manufacture of different types of <br />  ceramic ware, big kilns were arranged and fired &#40;Puram.228:2-4&#41;; <br />  Agam.308:6&#41;. Different burial and crematory urns were <br />manufactured. <br />  Kaveripumpattinam excavations prove the usage of bricks supported <br />by <br />  literary evidences. The excellent ferrous and non-ferrous <br />implements <br />  found at different sites prove the knowledge of material science <br />and <br />  processes like smelting, casting, wire-drawing and treat treatment <br />  &#40;Puram.21:7-8&#41;. Other metal work and jewelry manufacture also <br />  support the fact. The occurrence of quartz, glass and other beads <br />  with fine holes and colours prove the usage of temperature of the <br />  order of 1350-15000C. The ferrous and non-ferrous technology also <br />  requires the same range of temperature. All these literary and <br />  archaeological evidences prove the metallurgical skill of the <br />  ancient Tamils with the appropriate usage of fire in the applied <br />  technology.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  5. Fire and Fire-god: Tolkappiyam gives direct reference to fire-<br />  worship. The specific expressions used are Kodinilai, Kandazhi and <br />  Valli &#40;Porul.Purattitai.88&#41; to denote the existence of worship in <br />  three forms ? the Sun in the sky, Fire on the earth and the Moon <br />in <br />  the waters. This resembles Rigvedic description about the presence <br />  of fire in three forms : terreststial ? agni; celestial ? Indira <br />and <br />  Solar ? Sun, Mutti ? three fires.Panchagniis also implied in <br />  Paditruppattu &#40;14:1-4&#41;. After mentioning the four natural elements <br />  earethm water, ether and air, five types of fire are mentioned <br />as : <br />  star, lightning, moon, Sun and fire. There is a possibility that <br />the <br />  word "Deivam" directly denotes Fire-god as both roots Tevu and Te <br />  connote destruction and fire as explained: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  1. tevu + am = destroy + nature of = destroyer.<br />  <br />  2. ta + i + am = Fire + God + of nature = Fire-god.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  This is also supported by the following references, in which the <br />  nature of Fire-god is succinctly brought out: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Teral arum kadavul &#40;Agam.396:7-8&#41; = Fiery unique God.<br />  <br />  Arum teral marabir kadvul &#40;Agam.372:1&#41; = unique-fiery-traditional <br />  God.<br />  <br />  Teral aru marabin kadavyl &#40;Agam.13:3&#41; = Fiewry-unique-<br />traditional <br />  God.<br />  <br />  Teral arum kadavul &#40;Natri.189:3&#41; = Fiery-unique God.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  In all these references, the God is worshipped, prayed and <br />invoked; <br />  vow / oath taken before him &#40;as a witness&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  6. Taking Oath before fire by a lover: It is described as to how <br />the <br />  raising fire invites pouring ghee in it, so the lover is eager to <br />  accept the lady-love for marriage. Thus, he informs the messenger <br />  implying that he is prepared to marry her with sacraments before <br />the <br />  kindled fire raised by ghee &#40;Kurun.106:5-6&#41;. The lover takes vow <br />  before "Teral arum kadavul &#40;Agam.396:7-8&#41; = Fiery-unique God" and <br />  promises holding her hand that he would not forsake / desert her. <br />  Some commentators suggest that the God mentioned here is Shiva, <br />but <br />  there was no practice of taking oath / vow before Shiva, in fact, <br />  the name "Shiva" is not at all found in the ancient Tamil <br />  literature2. There is also a reference about going around the <br />fire, <br />  just like swans going round a pond &#40;Kali.69:5&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  7. Fire and Marriage: The above mentioned reference of going round <br />  fire by couple definitely denotes the marriage ceremony. Another <br />  ancient practice is the scred marriage of the fire-god with a <br />virgin <br />  symbolically. It is indirectly referred to in the commentary of <br />  Naccinarkkiniyar &#40;8th cent.CE&#41; to Tolkappiyam. After marriage, the <br />  groom is advised not to have union for three days, as they are <br />meant <br />  for the gods of Moon, Kandharvar &#40;Sun?&#41; and Angi &#40;Agni&#41;. In <br />  mythology, the custom of leading a bride round the fire, marrying <br />  symbolically to fire-god and her illusory union with fire-god <br />denote <br />  fertility charm, union of man and woman, the role of fire or heat <br />  energy placed in conception and the chastity status of woman. Fire <br />  stands as a witness along with the other four elements in all such <br />  union. The "Agni satchi" &#40;fire as witness&#41; ritual has been so <br />  intimate with the Tamil culture and tradition.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  8. Fire and Pregnancy: Mention has already been made about the <br />  symbolic marriage and union with fire by woman. The pregnant <br />ladies <br />  worship God &#40;Madurai.610&#41;. Natrinai explains about the smoke <br />  deposited on the body of a woman, who has delivered a child <br />  &#40;Nat.380:1-5&#41;. Iyavai pugai i.e, the smoke produced by a special <br />  mixture of white mustard, ghee etc., is applied to pregnant woman <br />  and as well as newly born baby to drive away evil spirits and <br />clean <br />  the house / place &#40;agam.98:15&#41;. There is also a practice that the <br />  vessels of Murugan temple should not be touched by virgins and <br />  pregnant women &#40;Puram.279:6-7&#41;, as the God might affect them. In <br />  fact, Velan &#40;the priest&#41; of Veriyadal always declares that the <br />lady-<br />  love / virgin has been affected by Murugu / Murugan. In the <br />  evolution of Karttikeya / Muruga myth Sanskritic references also <br />  mention that the pregnant ladies would be affected by him. The <br />  goddesses Jara, Jataharini, Hariti and Ayohi associated with <br />  Muruga / Karttikeya-Skanda affect pregnant ladies by destroying <br />  fetus from the embryos. Here, the fiery goddesses Anangu and Sur <br />  affect them. All these details are discussed below.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  9. Fire and Death: the dead are cremated in accordance with the <br />  principle of consigning body created by the fire i.e, by thr union <br />  of man and woman. Definitely, the cremation must have been the <br />most <br />  popular cusom of the followers of fire-cult and influenced others <br />  also. Thus, we find post-crematory burials in urns &#40;Puram.256:5&#41;. <br />  There has been one category of urn known as "Imattazhi" i.e, urn <br />  used for burial after cremation. Such Sacophaguses &#40;literally <br />  meaning "flesh eaters"&#41; are in the form of Ram and elephant, the <br />  vahanas of Fire-god and Muruga &#40;Seyon&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  10. The Principle of Fice Elements &#40;Panchabhuta tatva&#41;: the five <br />  elements earth, water, air, ether and fire have been mentioned at <br />  different places &#40;Padit.14:1-4; 24:15; Puram.2:1-6; Madu.453-54&#41;. <br />  The relation between them is also explained: Earth is <br />conglomeration <br />  of soil; sky is connected with earth; wind is produced in the sky; <br />  fire is from wind and water from fire &#40;Puram.2:1-6&#41;. The relation <br />  between body, life and growth with earth, water and food is also <br />  explained: As the human body depends on water, giving food amounts <br />  to giving life, because body is primarily based on food. Food is <br />  nothing but water in association with land &#40;earth&#41;. One who <br />combines <br />  water and land into one is God and the combination is "Unavin <br />  pindam" i.e, the body is considered as food, as it grows with the <br />  intake of food &#40;Puram.18:19-23, 186:1-4&#41;. Of course, without fire, <br />  the food cannot be digested, hence it is mentioned as "Vayitrutti" <br />  &#40;stomach fire&#41; [Agam.74:5; Padit.20:26]. Without air, life cannot <br />  last. This is the Panchbhuta tatva, connecting the five natural <br />  elements with the creation of five senses of human body and hence <br />  man himself. Therefore, if a man dies, it is quite natural to <br />think <br />  that his body should go back to the five natural elements quickly. <br />  For that, fire helps in cremation. In temple worship also, it has <br />  been faithfully incorporated.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  11. Sati and Fire: Sati is the practice of woman entering into <br />fire <br />  along with the dead body of her husband. Many of the chaste women <br />of <br />  the ancient Tamizhagam have performed Sati. The literature <br />  abundantly gives references about it3. As the marriage and union <br />  take place in front of and with fire, perhaps, it was a way for <br />them <br />  to unite with their counterparts in death also through fire. In <br />  fact, they have been characteristically mentioned as "Eri pugu <br />  Magalir" &#40;Ingu.Tani&#41; i.e, ladies ready to enter fire or entering <br />  fire. Perungoppendu, while performing sati says that the pond with <br />  full of blossomed lotus flowers and cool waters, and the pyre with <br />  flames are one and the same to her &#40;Puram.246:11-15&#41;. Fire-walking <br />  must have been a reminiscent<br />  <br />  practice of reduced form of sati, where fire is raised under <br />  identical situation and conditions, in which women participate, <br />even <br />  today in large numbers.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  12. Fire and Arunthati: The star represented by Arunthati and <br />  Arunthati herself have been held in esteem by the ancient Tamils <br />as <br />  hallmark of chastity. The bright Red star "Arunthati" is seen by <br />the <br />  bride during marriage, used for counting days and exalted for her <br />  nature of chastity &#40;Padit.89:18-20&#41;. The chastity of her is <br />  incomparable &#40;Padit.65:9&#41;. Here, she is mentioned as "Kamara <br />  kadavul" i.e, the Goddess who makes "Kamam" &#40;lust&#41; or Manmadan <br />  &#40;equivalent to "Cupid"&#41; fear. In fact, the virtue chastity is like <br />  fire. That is why virgin and married women pray God with fire i.e, <br />  lightning lamps as a form of `vestal fire&#39;. Of the seven divine <br />  women of the sky, the Reddish star &#40;represented by Arunthati&#41; is <br />  considered the most chaste lady &#40;Padit.31:26-28&#41;, because when the <br />  wife of Agni, Swaha tried to assume the forms of the wives of <br />  Saptarishis &#40;the Seven Sages&#41;, she could not succeed in the case <br />of <br />  Salini i.e, Arunthati &#40;Pari.5:44&#41;. She, with her chastity <br />occupying <br />  the highest position in the divine world, appears bright in the <br />dark <br />  &#40;Ingu.442:3-4&#41;. Here, the name Arunthati is specifically <br />mentioned, <br />  in other places, `Semmeen&#39; &#40;Red star&#41; and `Vadameen&#39; &#40;Northern <br />star&#41; <br />  are used to denote her fiery chaste character and the northern <br />  direction4.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  13. Fire and Women: Fire, chastity and divinity are closely <br />related, <br />  connected and unfied to different goddesses-worship, Motyher <br />goddess-<br />  worship and Pattini-worship. Chastity is the prime virtue of a <br />  woman, that protects not only her, but also her husband for a <br />woman, <br />  iot is like a fire, and compared with divinity &#40;Agam.16:18, 184:1, <br />  314:15; Ingu.76:4; Padit.5:4, 65:9&#41;. Women, married and unmarried <br />  women light, keep and trim plamps always &#40;Mullai.47-50; <br />Kurinchi.224-<br />  25; Pattina.246-48&#41;. "Pavai vilakku" is a lamp in the form of <br />woman <br />  holding a lamp in her hands &#40;Mullai.85; Nedunal.101-104&#41;. In the <br />  episode of Perungoppendu, all factors are brought: she declares <br />that <br />  she is not afraid of the fire &#40;pyre&#41;, as for her the pond with <br />  b;lossomed lotus flowers and cool waters, and the pyre with flames <br />  are one and the same. As a chaste lady, she does not want to live <br />  after the death of her husband following `Kaimmai&#39;; Elephants <br />bring <br />  dry fire-wood; `Kanavar&#39; &#40;forest-dwellers&#41; produce fire with fire-<br />  drill; the pyre is made in front of a remple of goddess &#40;Anangu&#41;; <br />  she looks towards the crematory grounds, where her husband was <br />  cremated and walks to the pyre. Thus, satisfying all the required <br />  conditions, she is elevated to the position of Goddess.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  14. Fire and Ram: Interestingly, the relation between Fire and Ram <br />  is brought out in the ancient Tamil literature. The Ram with its <br />  habitual shaking head protects the kindled fire in the cavity of <br />the <br />  wood produced with a drill, later it is raised with dry wood <br />  &#40;Agam.274:4-5&#41;. The fire-drill is kept inside a leather bag <br />  carefully &#40;Natri.142:3&#41;. The protection of fire by Ram or goat&#39;s <br />  leather is very significant. Perhaps, the nature of Ram&#39;s leather <br />  used for keeping fire-drill safely, during rainy seasons and ram&#39;s <br />  fur protecting it, must have been faithfully observed and <br />recorded. <br />  Later, when fire was personified and deified, ram made the vehicle <br />  &#40;Vahana&#41; of him. There is one poem in Purananuru, which succinctly <br />  explains the relation astronomically between the fiery star <br />Krittika <br />  &#40;Pleiades&#41; and Mesha &#40;Aries&#41;. In fact, the Solar year begins with <br />  the Sun&#39;s entry into Aries &#40;Mesha-Ram&#41; [Puram.229:1-2]5.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  15. Fire produced by Fire-drill: There are many references about <br />the <br />  fire produced by fire-drill. At one place, it is mentioned that <br />fire <br />  is produced by an illiterate cowherd &#40;Puram.331:4-5&#41;. As this <br />  description pertains to rural life, there must have been the <br />  prevalent of other fire-producing methods other than fire-drill. <br />The <br />  spark produced by the friction of drill is used to produce fire <br />  striking it on the dry leaves &#40;Agam.39:6-7&#41;. The fire produced by <br />  the fire-drill is kept growing by blowing through a pipe <br />&#40;Perum.178-<br />  79&#41;. There are people known as Erivalarppor, Mutti marabinar etc., <br />  who keep perpetual fires &#40;Puam.2:23, 122:3, 397:20-21; Pari.5:42&#41;. <br />  The muttee &#40;three fires&#41; are Agavaniyam, Garukapatyam and <br />  Dashinagniyam represented by square, semi-circle and triangle. <br />  Surprisingly, in the veri / veriyadal &#40;bacchanalian dance&#41;, on the <br />  kalam &#40;field or place&#41; same type of geometrical figues are drawn <br />  spreadinbg rice, baked rice, paddy etc known as pirappu &#40;an <br />  offering&#41; [Agam.98:9; Murugu.234]. in India, generally, fig <br />  &#40;Asvattha&#41; tree has been used for upper part i.e, stick and Sumi <br />  wood &#40;Prospois spicigem&#41; for lower part i.e, block with cavity of <br />  fire-drill. But, in the literature, specific reference I made <br />about <br />  bamboo fire-drill. Moreover, as other trees have also been <br />mentioned <br />  as sacred with fiery characxteristics, they might have also been <br />  used for the purpose. Badaga, Kanikar, Nayadi, Paniyan, Yanadi and <br />  other tribes produce fire by this method even today. Kadirs, <br />Irula, <br />  Badaga and Andamanese use the flint and steel striking methgod. <br />  Paniyans use frictional or cutting method also. Adichanallur <br />  findings include Fire-pistons, therefore, blowing and filling in <br />the <br />  fir-piston must have existed.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  16. Fire and Mountain: The relation of fire with mountain must <br />have <br />  been due to the fact of existence of volcano in the past. D. N. <br />  Wadia6 has noted that towards the close of cretaceous, a large <br />part <br />  of the IndianPeninsula was affected by stupendous outburst of <br />  volcanic energy, resulting in eruption of a thick series of lava <br />and <br />  associated pyroclastic materials. The fire produced in the <br />mountains <br />  appears in the desert &#40;Ingu.338:3&#41;. The mountain is so covered <br />with <br />  flowers of silk cotton trees &#40;Ilavam&#41; that it appears, as if it is <br />  burning &#40;Ibid&#41;. The reddish mountain is engulfed with the fire, as <br />  if it is surrounded with fire-creepers &#40;Ingu.353:1&#41;. The fire that <br />  originated through the bamboo trees &#40;by friction&#41; spreads to <br />entire <br />  hillsides by the heavy winds and the lengthy-creeper like flames <br />  enter the gaps of caves and stones of hills, thereby resulting in <br />  the explosion due to expansion &#40;of stones&#41; &#40;Ingu.395:1-2&#41;. The <br />  darkness of the caves of the mountain is removed by the glowing <br />  lance &#40;Agam.272:4-6&#41;. Lamps are lit on the top of hills <br />&#40;Agam.265:2-<br />  3&#41;. The reddish Himalayas appear as big flame &#40;Agam.265:2-3&#41;. This <br />  description is intriguing as it is not known, when Himalayas were <br />  with red colour and then it was started tro be covered with snow. <br />  After the period of summer with the scorching of forests, the <br />hills <br />  are without falls, as there are no rains. At that time the lights <br />  are lit on the peaks of hills &#40;during Karttigai&#41; on the occasion <br />of <br />  the great festival &#40;Agam.185:10-11&#41;. Lightning lamps on the top of <br />  hills clearly proves the existence of fire-worship and the <br />  association of fire with the hills. Thus, Kundram, Varai, Malai <br />  etc., have always been associated with fire. Tiruvannamalai, <br />  Sabarimalai etc., stand proof for periodical or perpetual burning <br />of <br />  fire on the mountains. As the ancient Tamils would have observed <br />the <br />  live-volcanoes erupting and experienced the wrath of them, they <br />  replicate and worship such past-symbols in the present.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  17. Fire and Trees: Fire and trees are closely related to each <br />  other. Each Tamil king or tribe has a sacred and Royal tree. To <br />  defeat one, symbolically, first the tree is brnt or cut down. <br />  Interestingly, there are many treferences about the burning down <br />of <br />  trees, towns and granaries in army-action7. The practice of sowing <br />  millets, after burning down trees is also mentioned8. Forest-fires <br />  are also described9. During such burning process and operations, <br />  some trees might have escaped fro the ravages of fire standing <br />  against it. Such trees might have been considered sacred and <br />divine, <br />  as even fire could not have done anything. Then, they start <br />  regarding that God / Goddess reside in the trees. Vanni &#40;Suma <br />tree&#41;, <br />  Kadambu, Banyan and other trees are thus considered divine.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  18. Fire and Flowers: There has been an intimate relation between <br />  fire and lotus elaborately brought pout by the ancient Tamil <br />  poets10. The Reddish colour, the petals, their arrangement, <br />  resemblance with flames, origin from waters and other details are <br />  compared. The Kuvalai &#40;Oleander&#41;, Alari &#40;Indian willow&#41;, Vengai <br />  &#40;ptercocarpus bilobus&#41; and Kanthal &#40;Gloriosa superba&#41; have always <br />  been compared with the characteristics of fire. Thus, flowers are <br />  compared with fire, flames adding divinity to them and then, <br />  attributing to a particular God / Goddess with sacredness.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  19. Fire and Sur: Sur is the goddess, variously mentioned11, <br />  residing on the hills, at the sides of the hills, in the forests, <br />  springs, and trees. She has born of rains &#40;Agam.303:5-6&#41;. She has <br />  been terrible and fearful forms; capable of assuming any form; <br />  affecting women and children; and is just like fire. There has <br />been <br />  another Sur mentioned denoting to Surapadman, killed by Murugan. <br />  Though, the commentators imply killer as "Murugan", the <br />expressions <br />  used are Sey, reddish Vel, fiery Vel, one who has Vel and so on. <br />  Natrinai perhaps gives a clue to differentiate between the two <br />Surs <br />  as noted above: The goodess &#40;Anangu&#41; who gives the water-falls <br />  resides in the hills; terrifying and fearful caves are there in <br />such <br />  hills; like a lightning, the glowing lance shows the way in the <br />  caves driving darkness away with its light. This shows the slowly <br />  developing of Murugan myth by transferring Sey, the Red one into <br />  Muruga and Sur into Surapadma. The subjugation of Sur is further <br />  shown as follows: The spring with divinity falls from the hills; <br />the <br />  Sur women dance according to the tune of the natural music <br />produced <br />  by the water-falls adorning themselves with the garlands of <br />Kuvalai <br />  and Kanthal &#40;Natri.34:1-6&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  20. Fire and Anangu: There has been another goddess "Anangu" <br />  mentioned repeatedly with the same characteristics as that of Sr. <br />  She resembles fire more than Sur12. Besides the natural dwelling <br />  places, she has temple &#40;Puram.247:4&#41; and idol-form &#40;Agam.159:5-6&#41;. <br />  This proves that she is attaining the status of Goddess with full-<br />  fledged worship. In the case of fire-drill, the drill is <br />considered <br />  as male and the block with hole female. Similarly, in the <br />  deification of fire, Anangu might have been considered as "fire-<br />  goddess". In fact, she has directly been compared with fire: Just <br />  like the fire produced by drilling in the wood is used to burn <br />other <br />  fire-wood, she has become "Anangu" for her own town &#40;as it would <br />  burned down by the King, whom she refused to marry &#40;Puram.349:6-7&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  21. Fire and Kollippavai: Kollippavai, literally means a goddess <br />  that kills. The Kolli hills are with high peaks &#40;Agam.33:4&#41;; with <br />  manyJack fruit trees wiuth their reddish roots &#40;Ibid.213:15&#41;; and <br />  with pure water falls. The Deiva resides in the mountains creates <br />an <br />  image of pavai with all natural traits, as if it moves with life <br />  &#40;Agam.189;2-4&#41;. It is also mentioned that she has been created by <br />  the union of Bhuta &#40;Agam.192:8-9&#41;. By the sides of such hills, <br />  stands the image / painting of Kollippavai with all her bewitching <br />  beauty and features, that cannot be disfigured or affected by the <br />  blowing, showering rains, shaking thunders, all other natural <br />  adversaries and the wrath of the entire world &#40;Natri.201:5-11&#41;. <br />  Here, she equals the fire, perhaps attaining its character.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  22. Fire and Se, Se Ey or Seyon: Se denotes Red colour. Sey or Se <br />Ey <br />  connotes the Red one, juvenility, son, child, Mars and bamboo. <br />  Accordingly, Seyon means one with reddish colour with youth or <br />with <br />  bull, thus implying Muruga or Shiva, however, booth names are not <br />  found as such. Taking clue from Tolkappiyam, some commentators <br />while <br />  interpreting Mayon, the Black One as Tirumal &#40;Vishnu&#41;, started <br />  alluding that Seyon, the Red One as Murugan. This transition can <br />be <br />  found in Tirumurugatyruppadai itself, besides Paripadal. The <br />former <br />  starts with a specific reference to sun-worship &#40;Murugu.1-2&#41; goes <br />on <br />  to praise Seyon; the fiery and lengthy Vel &#40;lance&#41; that killed Sur <br />  &#40;46&#41;; Se Ey with reddish lance with Sevvel &#40;61&#41;; from the first <br />  face, many rays spread like flowers in the ears &#40;206-70&#41;; he has <br />Ram <br />  and peacock as Vahana &#40;210&#41;; brought up by six women, implying six <br />  Kartgai women &#40;255&#41;; son of God who resides under banyan tree <br />&#40;256&#41;; <br />  Son of Goddess of mountain &#40;257&#41;; Son of "Kotravai" &#40;258&#41;; Child <br />  of "Pazhaiyol", the ancient Goddess &#40;259&#41;; killer of mountain <br />  Kravuncha &#40;266&#41;; the Red One ? Se Ey &#40;271&#41;; and killer of Sur <br />&#40;275&#41;. <br />  In Paripadal, the references are direct: he is born of fire &#40;5:30-<br />  35&#41;; Analan &#40;Agni&#41; gives elephant &#40;5:57-580, whereas, Gnaman <br />&#40;Yama&#41; <br />  gives Ram! &#40;61-62&#41; and later, other known details are given <br />  faithfully. From the above, it an be noticed, in his metamorphosis <br />  from fire-god to Muruga, how Seyon is made to have the characters <br />by <br />  having Reddish dress &#40;Angi-another name for Agni&#41;, riding Ram and <br />so <br />  on. In the case of Anangu, it is directly said that "Murugan is <br />  Anangu" and thus, straight away taking over Anangu by Seyon or <br />  Murugan &#40;agam.98:10-muruganangena=murugu-anangu-ena&#41;, whereas Sur <br />  has been subjugated as explained above.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  23. Veriyadal in Kalam: The worship of Sey, Se Ey or Seyon; murugu <br />  or Neduvel is always associated and accompanied with the following: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Kalam: <br />  Pandar: <br />  Pirappu: <br />   <br />  <br />  Pillar: <br />  Kodi: <br />   <br />  <br />  Dress: <br />  Garland: <br />  Music: <br />  Songs: <br />  Sacrifice: <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Fire: <br />  Time: <br />   <br />  <br />  Velan: <br />  Oracle: <br />  Veri: <br />   <br />  <br />  Veriyadal: <br />  the place is selected &#40;Agam.98:14&#41;<br />  <br />  a Pandal; is contructed &#40;Agam.98:15&#41;<br />  <br />  Offerings of rice, baked rice, paddy etc., arranged in geometrical <br />  forms by ladies &#40;Agam.98:9; Murugu.234&#41;.<br />  <br />  Kadambu pillar erected and red rope tied &#40;Murugu.225; 230-1&#41;.<br />  <br />  a flag s tied in the Kadamba tree or hoisted in the pillar <br />  &#40;Agam.382:3; Murugu.237&#41;.<br />  <br />  two cloths are worn &#40;Murugu.230&#41;.<br />  <br />  garland of buds is adorned &#40;Agam.22 & 382&#41;.<br />  <br />  various musical instruments played producing din &#40;Agam.98:14&#41;.<br />  <br />  sung about Neduvel.<br />  <br />  a goat is sacrificed and its blood is mixed with flour etc <br />  &#40;Agham.22:10&#41;; blood is sprinkled and so also turmeric mixed with <br />  water &#40;Murugu.234&#41;.<br />  <br />  fire is raised near the altar &#40;Agam.138:16-18&#41;.<br />  <br />  the veri / veriyadal &#40;bacchanalian dance&#41; starts by or around <br />  midnight and continues upto dawn &#40;Ibid&#41;.<br />  <br />  the priest, who performs the veri / veriyadal.<br />  <br />  the changing of colour of the edible root &#40;Natri.47:8&#41;.<br />  <br />  the disease supposedly caused by Anangu, Sur or Murugu as <br />predicted <br />  by the Velan to the mother of the affected virgin.<br />  <br />  thus, the dance is performed with all fun-fare<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  The first seven steps resemble that of a performance of yagna. <br />  Either, yagna developed after ritualization of fire-cult must have <br />  been incorporated these elements or they must have been a poor <br />  imitation of yagna. As Kalavelvi is also compared with yahna, both <br />  Kalavelvi and Verityadal, as for as fire-cult aspect is concerned, <br />  must have been the preservation of some ancient practice and it <br />  cannot be simply ignored as poetic myth, because of exaggerated <br />  comparison. Unlike Kalavelvi, Veriyadal is not at all compared <br />with <br />  yagnas by the poets. However, the resemblance is significant. The <br />  sacrifice and sprinkling of blood imply fertility charm. Actually, <br />  the references about Veriyadal, the lady-love ridicules for the <br />  performance of Veriyadal and the hypocricy of Velan, as she knows <br />  her position very well. In fact, the lover is visiting her <br />  stealthily as usual at the same time, when Veriyadal takes place. <br />  Therefore, it is understood that the women, who are supposed to <br />have <br />  been affected or infected by Sur, Anangu, Murugu or Neduvel are <br />  pregnant in most cases.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  24. Kala velvi: Two types of Velvis &#40;Yagnas&#41; are described: One <br />  performed at battle fields and another at yagnasalas. First, <br />  Kalavelvi is considered: the hearth is made of human heads; <br />Kuvilam <br />  &#40;Vilva-cratoeva religiosa&#41; is used as fire wood; the soup is <br />  prepared with intestines etc., and mixed with the ladle mae by <br />  fixing skull to the stick of Vanni tree &#40;Suma-prospis spicigera&#41;. <br />  Here, the related words used ? Adupppu &#40;hearth&#41;, Viragu &#40;fire-<br />wood&#41;, <br />  Vanni &#40;Suma tree&#41; and Vettu &#40;Yagna&#41; are all connected with fire. <br />  Yagna performed at yagnasala are compared with the glorious acts <br />  performed on the battle fields, in a similar manner &#40;Puram.26:80=-<br />  11&#41;. This may also be the poetic garb of mentioning the actual <br />  yagnas performed by the kings like Rajasuyam.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  25. Velvi &#40;Yagna&#41;: There have been many references about the <br />actual <br />  yagnas performed. In fact, all the three Chera, Cola and Pandya <br />  kings performed many yagnas. The names of Cholan Rajasuyam vetta <br />  Perunkilli and Pandyan Palyagasalai Mudikudimi Pervazhudhiyan are <br />  self0explanatory. The references about these kings are considered <br />to <br />  be very ancient of the extant Tamil literature dating back to <br />c.300 <br />  BCE and even before, Copious description about Vedas, Six Angas <br />  &#40;Vedangas&#41;, 21 types of yagnas, three fires, 14 types of cows <br />  through which required ghee is obtained and duties of Andanar is <br />  found &#40;Agam.166&#41;. Yagnasalas, shape, two types of Ahuti etc., are <br />  mentioned. Parppar, Andanar, Arutozhilalar, Aravor, Marayavar, <br />  Muppirinulor, Irupirappalar, Vedhiyar, Munivar and other <br />expressions <br />  are used to denote persons connected with the rituals of yagnas, <br />  Vedas and other fire-connected ceremonies depending upon their <br />  nature of duties performed.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  26. Fire ? Creator and Destroyer: The fire that is due to burning <br />  down of the cities of enemies rises to the skies like many Suns. <br />It <br />  is like Uzhitti &#40;Mdangai-the great fire produced at the time of <br />  deluge&#41; that brings an end to this world, supposed to have hidden <br />  under oceans &#40;Vadavai ? submarine fire: Padit.62:5-8&#41;. During <br />  deluge, to reduce the burden of the world &#40;land&#41;, water spreads <br />  covering it with huge waves raising and darkness falls on it in <br />such <br />  a way that none can even know the direction. Again, there will be <br />  light with the appearance of Sun and the Madangai Ti &#40;Submarine <br />  fire&#41; boils away the deluge waters &#40;so that the land surfaces, <br />life <br />  spring back on it&#41; &#40;Padit.72:10-15&#41;. This description signifies <br />the <br />  cyclic appearance and disappearance of the land mass &#40;with <br />  population&#41; and the relation between the five natural elements. <br />The <br />  importance of fire is also brought out, as it helps the world to <br />  appear again and so also life on it. Creation and destruction of <br />  fire are thus explained. The conscious recording of such phenomena <br />  by the ancient poets should be noted with significance.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  27. Archaeological Evidences for Fire-cult13: The Neolithic <br />culture <br />  of South India used burnished ochre-coloured ware including post-<br />  firing ochre painting. The pottery designs include triangles and <br />  wavy lines representing fire. Other fire connected descriptions <br />are <br />  Lotus, Kanthal, Kuvalai and Vengai like floral designs. The <br />  paintings at Kupgal, Maski, Piklihal etc., include the long humped <br />  bulls &#40;Bos Indicus&#41; and Rams. The principal colour used is Red <br />  predominantly pigment based. All these are indicative of fire-<br />cult. <br />  The presence of Copper and Gold ornaments proves the knowledge of <br />  metal working with fire under controlled temperatures.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  27.1. The megalithic culture has abundant evidences for fire-cult. <br />  Ferrous and non-ferrous technology proves the extensive <br />application <br />  of heat energy knowing its complete knowledge as evidenced by many <br />  excavated samples of tools, implements, vessels, jewelry etc. <br />  Tridents and lances found are associated with fire-cult, as they <br />are <br />  connected with goddess-worship and Veriyadal. Iron bells also show <br />  the religious connection. The bronzes exhibit high degree of skill <br />  in metal working, include small cups, bowls, jars etc., with lids <br />up <br />  to 9 inches. They are with triangular incised designs. The lids <br />have <br />  animal motifs including cocks and sheep/ Rams with twisted horns <br />are <br />  found on the bronze articles. Rectangular stone objects smeared <br />with <br />  a thick coat of red ochre are also found. Pottery has the same <br />  designs as noted above. Three legged jars, vessels and small urns <br />  may represent fire-god, as Agni is supposed to have three legs. A <br />  Ram shaped sarcophagus has been found with detachable head <br />portion. <br />  The cow shaped sarcophagus and elephant legged are also associated <br />  with fire-cult, as cow is connected with yagnas and elephant with <br />  Murugan and Analan &#40;Agni&#41;. The terracotta figures also include <br />Ram, <br />  sheep, unicorn, humped bulls, mother goddess. At some places <br />  polished stones are kept for worship considered as thunderbolts or <br />  missiles of fire-god and they are found even today in village <br />  temples.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  27.2. For firing of pottery up to 8000C to 9000C temperature is <br />  required; for manufacture of glass of the order 1350-15000C and <br />  ferrous and non-ferrous metal working up to 18000C temperature <br />  required under controlled conditions. For getting different <br />colours <br />  of beads, different chemicals must have been added. All these <br />  processes cannot be done without any facility of handling high <br />  temperature equipments. Copper wire and rings, gold ornaments, <br />  bronze articles etc., prove the intricate metal working and <br />  processes14.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  27.3. The pre-historic rock paintings found in different parts of <br />  Tamilnadu &#40;South Arcot, Coimbatore and Dharmapuri&#41; dated back to <br />c. <br />  2500 BCE and painted in ochre-red colour have many fire related <br />  depictions. They clearly show the fire sacrifices and rituals, <br />  Veriyadal and fire-god15.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  28. Fire and Temple worship: As times are changed so also Gods and <br />  connected rituals. As pure form of fire-worship has been <br />regulated, <br />  only assimilated and modified worship is observed today. Without <br />  fire, perhaps, temple worship with rites, rituals and ceremonies, <br />  whether according to Vedas or otherwise cannot be thought of. <br />Temple <br />  worship embodies all the religious and social aspects of human <br />life. <br />  Not only theological principles, but also philosophical <br />intricacies <br />  have been incorporated in it for the understanding of laymen with <br />  simplicity. Particularly, the Panchbhuta worship is revealed in <br />day <br />  to day worship and traditional practices of the devotees: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Earth<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Water<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Fire<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Wind<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Sky<br />  It is offered as such or in the form of holy ash, Kumkum etc., to <br />  be applied on the forehead with veneration.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Associating with each temple, there is a tank, river or some <br />thirth <br />  &#40;water source&#41;, in which the visiting devotees take bath, <br />purifying <br />  themselves before entering the temples. Invariably, there will be <br />an <br />  Agni thirth, besides other thirths. In fact, the tank itself is <br />  divided into different areas with presiding deities, where the <br />area <br />  belonging to fire-god is significantly marked.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  As has been mentioned, fire forms the basis of every worship. <br />  Through fire only God is invoked. Different forms of lamps and <br />  lights of various sizes, shapes and metals not only arranged and <br />  kept, but also shown to the deity. Camphor-fire shown to deity is <br />  offered to the devotees for venerable acceptance.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Chamras &#40;fans&#41; are waved to deity. God is invoked with mantras <br />  treating vayu &#40;air&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  It is implied in the name "Kadavul" &#40;One who is beyond <br />  comprehension&#41;. Figuratively, empty space is shown to understand <br />the <br />  nature.<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  29. Inferences: Traditionally, the direction and angle of Fire <br />  &#40;Agni&#41; is South-east. Therefore, the presence of fire-cult in that <br />  area of India is not exaggerated. Geologically, the Southern part <br />of <br />  India is very old &#40;and has been due to volcanic action&#41; than the <br />  north. The fire-cult must have been also been the oldest of any <br />  civilization, heritage, culture and tradition, because of its <br />  association with the man from the beginning. The fire-worship must <br />  have been developed later with the ritualization of the cult. The <br />  worship can be considered under naturalistic, Theriomorpohic, <br />  anthromorphic, fetishistic and symbolic forms.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  1. Naturalistic: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  2. Theriomorphic: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  3. Anthropomorphic: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Fetishistic: <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Symbolic: <br />   <br />  Fire worshipped s such connecting it with the Sun, Moon, starts, <br />  other planets like Mars, mountain, waters etc.,<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Ram, lephant &#40;as vahanas of fire-god, Muruga&#41;, cattle connected <br />with <br />  yagna and Sun.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Se, Se Ey, Seyon, Shive ? Masculine form.<br />  <br />  Sur, Anangu, Kollippavai, Arunthati, Salini, Pattini,, Kotravai, <br />  Kadukizhal, Pazhaiyol, Ayirai etc., - Feminine form.<br />  <br />  The personification of fire led to ultimate deification. <br />Recognizing <br />  the natural phenomenon, such process must have been in turn <br />divided <br />  into masculine and feminine forms. In the course of time, the <br />  combination and permutation of masculine and feminine natures led <br />to <br />  further multiplication and unification of Gods and Goddesses <br />  depending upon the nature, geographical location of the place, <br />  availability of natural resources and so on.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Literally evidences of idols ? of Anangu &#40;Agam.159:5-6&#41;; Pattini <br />  &#40;Padit.Padigam.5:4&#41;; Kollippavai &#40;Natri.201:5-11, 192:8-9, <br />185:11&#41;; <br />  Pavai &#40;Ingu.221&#41;; <br />  <br />  Image of gold &#40;Agam.212:1, Madu.410; Natri.192:8: a Pandya king <br />  seizes an image from Musiri after a war &#40;Agam.149:12&#41;, manufacture <br />  of an Idol &#40;Madu.723-74&#41;.<br />  <br />  According to Agama sastra, the image of Fire-god &#40;Agni&#41; should be <br />  there in the south-east among the Parivara deities and in Gopuras. <br />  Agni is found in the gopuras of Darasuram and Kailasanatha <br />temples. <br />  In Tiruppugalur, there is one Agni idol with two heads, six eyes, <br />  seven tongues, four horns, big belly and three legs. In <br />Chennimalai <br />  temple, God Muruga has two heads and is known as Agneswaran.<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Fire is symbolically represented by triangles, wavy lines to <br />denote <br />  flames and fire-pits; Swastika and Om are indirect <br />representations. <br />  The three fires Agvaniyam, Garukapatyam and Dakshinagni are <br />  represented by square, semi-circle and triangle. In temples, <br />  southern quarters contain homasthana &#40;the place for yagna&#41; with <br />  nityagnigunta &#40;perpetual fire-pit&#41; for agnicarya &#40;the daily fire <br />  sacrifices&#41;.<br />  <br />   <br />   <br />  <br />  30. Conclusions: In view of the above literary, archaeological and <br />  other evidences presented, discussed and explained, the following <br />  conclusions are drawn: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Fire-cult is one of the earliest forms of worship of the ancient <br />  Tamils.<br />   <br />  <br />  Formation of fire-god concept and his characteristics may be <br />unique <br />  and independently developed.<br />   <br />  <br />  Ritualization of fire-cult led to the yagna oriented sacrifices. <br />  Veriyadal may be the reminiscence of such cult and Kalavelvi an <br />  imitation.<br />   <br />  <br />  The technical advancement and capacity of handling temperatures of <br />  the order of 1500 to 18000C may upset the Neolithic and megalithic <br />  barriers.<br />   <br />  <br />  Anthropomorphic form of fire-cult in both masculine and feminine <br />  nature led to the origin of pantheistic mode of worship with <br />  increasing Gods and Goddesses.<br />   <br />  <br />  Masculine forms of fire-god are Se, Se Ey, Seyon, Sevvel, Neduvel <br />  etc.<br />   <br />  <br />  Feminine form of fire-god &#40;goddesses&#41; are Sur, Anangu, <br />Kollippavai, <br />  Arunthati, Salini, Surara magalir, Varaiyara magilar, Vanara <br />  magalir, Kotravai, Pazhaiyol, Kaduraikkadavul, Oru mulai arutta <br />  Tiruma unni, Pattini, Sapta kanniyar and so on. The lengthy list <br />of <br />  goddesses proves the continuous popularity of them not only in <br />  earlier times, but also today.<br />   <br />  <br />  The concept of Kodinilai, Kandazhi and Valli is unique in the fire-<br />  cult of the ancient Tamils leading to other philosophical musings.<br />   <br />  <br />  The change and interchange of anthropomorphic worship is noted in <br />  the case of fire-god to Se, Se Ey or Seyon; Anangu or Sur to <br />Seyon; <br />  Seyon as the son of the combination of the God residing under <br />Banyan <br />  tree and Kotravai.<br />   <br />  <br />  The above evidences show that Anangu, Sur and Sey were cast into <br />  crucible after synthesizing and reconciling the characters to <br />bring <br />  out Murugu an Murugan.<br />   <br />  <br />  The attribution and comparison of fiery characteristics to and <br />with <br />  Stars, Planets and Gods form the basis of development of theology.<br />   <br />  <br />  The fire representing words might have been developed in <br />  representing such factors, as they have different meanings <br />including <br />  fire and characters of fire and stars and planets.<br />   <br />  <br />  Temple worship embodies every aspect of fire physically, <br />  philosophically and theologically.<br />   <br />  <br />  Fire-cult is explicit in rural areas, but implicit in urban areas. <br />  Fire-walking ceremony may be the left-out practice of Sati in a <br />new <br />  garb, as in the literature itself exemption in the form of Kaimmai <br />  nonbu was given to widows.<br />   <br />  <br />  Modified forms of fire-related festivals are Bhogi, Pongal, Holi, <br />  Rathyatras, Deepavali and Karttigai. Tiruvannamalai, Sabarimalai <br />  etc., stand proof for periodical burnings on the hills.<br />   <br />  <br />  Notes and References<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  For convenience, the important literary references are given in <br />the <br />  brackets at the end of a sentence or sentences.<br />   <br />  <br />  The abbreviations used for each work is as follows: <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Tolkappiyam - Tol<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Ettuttogai<br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  Natrinai - Natri.<br />  Kuruntogai ?

Malaipadukadam.<br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  The term `Shiva&#39; is not found in the "Sangam" literature, but in <br />  Tevaam, Tiruvacagam etc., of 7th ? 8th century works. As a part of <br />  continuation of masculine form of fire-worship, the crematory <br />  grounds which were supposed to be the dwelling places of Shiva <br />might <br />  have been converted into temples. Tirukkollikkadu, <br />  Tiruthalaichangadu, Tiruttalaiyalangadu, Tiruvanniyur, <br />  Tiruvelvikkudi ? names clearly prove the connection of fire-<br />worship <br />  of one form or the other. Even the presiding deities have the <br />  appellations of fire e.g, Tiyadiappar, Angneswarar etc.<br />   <br />  <br />  Tolkappiyam makes a specific reference about virtuous wife <br />entering <br />  into the flames of the funeral pyre of her husband <br />  &#40;Tol.Porul.Purat.79&#41;. When Chera and Chola kings died fighting, <br />  their wives performed Sati &#40;Puram.62:13-16&#41;.
