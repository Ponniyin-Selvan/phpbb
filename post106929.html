			<div class="content"><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Whether you see it as Kal/Kadavul/Kalai ... the sole reason the <br />stone<br />  is placed in the museum is to respect the creativity of the<br />  GOD&#40;sculptor&#41; who created it.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Vairam</div></blockquote>Hi vairam,<br /><br />A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - meaning <br />its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if metal) <br />just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with the <br />qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to temple <br />sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.<br /><br />as regards the god of man's creation and the man of god's creation - <br />these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the question <br />of who is god is different from is God there.<br /><br />so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves - <br />to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools of <br />thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a fistfull <br />of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. <br /><br />But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in front <br />of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers were <br />deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of suggestion -<br />but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />and not the location. I can vouch of this personally - a year back i <br />had such a profound experience - a chance visit to the singapore <br />museum....reposting below<br /><br />We were greated at the entrance itself by a cut out of a chola<br />bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There were a couple of other<br />chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar.

			<div class="content">Hi Vijay,<br />I am surely ignorant about temple sculpture. I spoke more in terms<br />of the thought process of the sculpture.. though there might be so<br />many procedures before installing a sculpture as god...the creator of<br />the idol would have had immense pleasure while he created it..<br />Very similar thought process like Andal had ...happiness that the<br />garland she had woven would be used to decorate the lord...<br />Even till day you will see people happy when the garland they bring<br />is used to decorate the lord in the temple.<br />I spoke about simple emotions/happiness that people have and what<br />kind of happiness sculptor would have had when he knows the idol he is<br />sculpting is going to be installed in a temple.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Vairam<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S"<br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Whether you see it as Kal/Kadavul/Kalai ... the sole reason the <br />  stone<br />    is placed in the museum is to respect the creativity of the<br />    GOD&#40;sculptor&#41; who created it.<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Vairam<br />    <br />  <br />  Hi vairam,<br />  <br />  A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - meaning <br />  its is not treated as moolavar &#40; if in stone&#41; or utsavar &#40; if metal&#41; <br />  just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings &#40; ok - you may <br />  call it rituals&#41; - which are performed to infuse the idol with the <br />  qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />  plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to temple <br />  sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.<br />  <br />  as regards the god of man&#39;s creation and the man of god&#39;s creation - <br />  these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the question <br />  of who is god is different from is God there.<br />  <br />  so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves - <br />  to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools of <br />  thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a fistfull <br />  of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. <br />  <br />  But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in front <br />  of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers were <br />  deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of suggestion -<br />  but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />  just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />  and not the location.

			<div class="content">There is a whole south indian temple installed within<br />Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was 'sold' or so I<br />heard by a famous south indian merchant (brothers)<br />some years ago, how they 'sold' century old art is<br />quite a mystery but possible considering the sad state<br />of our temples and historical monuments.<br /><br />An exhibit in a museum is of course not the same<br />purpose as a temple exhibit - but look at some of our<br />temples, the century old pillars 'adorned' by human<br />spittle, red dye(kumkum?:)) and waste and names<br />scribbled on stone where the sculptor himself did not<br />leave his..Some of them are much better off as museum<br />exhibits atleast our future generations will get to<br />see them in good form.<br /><br />--- Vairam  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Vijay,<br />  I am surely ignorant about temple sculpture.

			<div class="content">Vairam<br /><br />Again, neenga conceptually different people comparison panaringa...<br />Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally wrong.<br />Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion itself.

As with Valli, <br />where it is said 'Kura magal iru patham paritha sekara', devotion has <br />that respect with the greater spiritual plane.<br /><br />Ayana sirpi's love for sculpture is dazzled when sivakami is lost. <br />Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.<br /><br />In any form, Andal's poo malai or paa malai, never die with time, but <br />Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any human work, however <br />art (poo malai - paa malai etc) devoted in the service of God, is <br />immortal.<br /><br />I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to guide us on Andal, i am <br />too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai, even to think of <br />her as human.<br /><br />-- R<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vairam"  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Vijay,<br />  I am surely ignorant about temple sculpture.
