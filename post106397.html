Ratnakara imagines, in <br />the<br />loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the goddess <br />of<br />prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />nritta<br />aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />into<br />light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord's <br />musical<br />orchestra: <br />astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />samalakshyata nakalakshmih (Haravijya 19.5).<br /><br />This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />music,<br />Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping time<br />and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, there <br />is<br />an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali: <br />vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatahÂ….. vini cha panavi tali<br />nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />(Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11) tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi hyaninditah<br />(Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21) naikatanaratas svarah (Lingamahapurana <br />1,<br />65, 40). The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina provided<br />with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of the<br />svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />rathagitas cha (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44). Ratha is Rathantarasama,<br />by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva's fondness for Sama is very<br />well known.</div>

			<div class="content">Mr Vijay,<br /><br />If your intention is to conclude that ThirumAl is indeed a Siru <br />Deivam, I can only say that, at best this is a Perspective. For one <br />can show similar references where Siva is considered a Siru Dheivam. <br />Have you been to Thiruvananthapuram? Did you notice the very small, <br />rather smaller than that of Vishnu in Patteeswaram, Sivalingam, near <br />the right hand of Ananthapadmanabhaswamy which is in a "protecting" <br />posture? So, on your same argument lines, will you accept that Siva <br />is also a "Siru Dheivam"? <br /><br />And since when, the sculptures were used to conclude the "siRumai" <br />or "perumai" of a God? <br /><br />So, unless you intended this statement for fun, there is no logic in <br />trying to prove that Thirumal is a "siru dheivam" based on the <br />Patteswaram sculpture as the vice versa is true from <br />Thiruvananthapuram "moolasthAnam" itself.<br /><br />So, the fact that Ottakoothar represented the thoughts of Kulothunga <br />II by calling Thirumal as "SiRu dheivam" is itself an undisputable <br />testimony to the intolerance of Kulothunga II<br /><br />But I see that, since an opinion is already formed about the <br />generosity of the Chola Kings, it is hard to digest that one or two <br />Chola Kings did exhibit some levels of intolerance. One need to have <br />a paradigm shift to do an unbiased study to conclude. <br /><br />Afterall "yAnaikkum aDi sarukkum". I am not branding all Chola kings <br />as Vaishnava haters, nor could I do it in the wake of available <br />inscriptions which talk about there true reverence to all Religion <br />and not only Vaishnvaism.

At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />  the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />  into<br />  light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />  prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord&#39;s <br />  musical<br />  orchestra: <br />  astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />  cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />  samalakshyata nakalakshmih &#40;Haravijya 19.5&#41;.<br />  <br />  This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />  music,<br />  Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping <br />time<br />  and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />  adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, <br />there <br />  is<br />  an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />  Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali: <br />  vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatahÂ….. vini cha panavi tali<br />  nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />  &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11&#41; tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />hyaninditah<br />  &#40;Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21&#41; naikatanaratas svarah <br />&#40;Lingamahapurana <br />  1,<br />  65, 40&#41;. The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />provided<br />  with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />  innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of <br />the<br />  svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />  the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />  rathagitas cha &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44&#41;. Ratha is <br />Rathantarasama,<br />  by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva&#39;s fondness for Sama is <br />very<br />  well known.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Mr Vijay,<br /><br />As I said earlier, I never took it as an offense. However I accept <br />that I miread your intentions and apologise for the same while <br />thanking you for the clarifications. <br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /> wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Yes, in this sculptural composition, from the artist&#39;s perspective <br />  of the event being depicted - the central actor is shiva in his <br />  dance pose...the others are all - if i were to use the correct <br />tamil <br />  word &#40; again pl dont take offence&#41; parivara dieties.</div></blockquote>No. Absolutely no offence taken either. As it is just customary on <br />the part of Vaishnavites to term Siva as a Parivara devatha, it is <br />cutomary on part of Saivites to term Vishnu as a Parivara devatha. I <br />am okay with this term definitely.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>so now would <br />  you brand this beautiful piece of art an offencive sculpture &#40; <br />  considering that this is part of a one piece stone pillar - and <br />the <br />  craftmen has had the greatness to sculpt it to such perfection - <br />  even in that minute detail as to the sangu chakaram and the other <br />  attributes...&#41; and compare this artist to ottakutan.</div></blockquote>From my above comment, you know my answer. Definitely I dont want to <br />fault the sculptor. Who knows, the same sculptor may have made <br />another in a Vishnu temple where he would have depicted Siva <br />prostrating before Vishnu. For him, it is his job. He has to carry <br />out his depiction according to the beliefs of the community for whom <br />he is building it. This is quite natural and hence no need to brand <br />him or the sculpture as offensive.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>i would also take this as a positive depiction of the event - the <br />  idea was not to belittle either brahma, vishnu or paravathi - but <br />it <br />  shows that the presence of them as an audience to the dance - even <br />  one step further joyfully participating in it.</div></blockquote>Agreed absolutely.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Have you been to Thiruvananthapuram? Did you notice the very <br />small, <br />    rather smaller than that of Vishnu in Patteeswaram, Sivalingam, <br />  near <br />    the right hand of Ananthapadmanabhaswamy which is in <br />  a "protecting" <br />    posture? So, on your same argument lines, will you accept that <br />  Siva <br />    is also a "Siru Dheivam"? <br /><br />  Of course, in the same line of thinking as above....the main idea <br />of <br />  the sculpture is sayana kolam of perumal. all the others are side <br />  actors...but just for argument sake - can you compare this with <br />the <br />  jala sayana perumal of mallai shore temple and search for the <br />lingam <br />  there...</div></blockquote>Perfect. The legends of the Sayana Perumal are different in <br />different locations. Remember I told that the Sthala Puranams are <br />nothing but a marketing tactic. Though this is true, the forms of <br />the murthys in those temples were made with this legend in mind. So <br />the legend for the Sayana posture in Thiruvanathapuram is very <br />different as that of Jala Sayana perumal in Mamallapuram. <br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>And since when, the sculptures were used to conclude <br />the "siRumai" <br />    or "perumai" of a God? <br />  <br />  I thought that was the subject of this entire discussion - to me <br />the <br />  above two are not instigative...whereas a sarabeshwara &#40; believe <br />me <br />  you have to see the one on madurai gopuram&#41; is something that we <br />can <br />  dispute /argue. in that same mature argument - the lingothbava <br />  legend finds mention and sculptural representations even during <br />the <br />  times when &#40; as per the information currently available to us&#41; <br />there <br />  were no serious divisions between the two followers.</div></blockquote>I am afraid, I am not able to understand when you say that the <br />entire discussion is based on that. I thought we were discussing <br />about the authencity of the incident of Govindarajar being thrown <br />into sea. <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>So, unless you intended this statement for fun, there is no <br />logic <br />  in <br />    trying to prove that Thirumal is a "siru dheivam" based on the <br />    Patteswaram sculpture as the vice versa is true from <br />    Thiruvananthapuram "moolasthAnam" itself.<br />    <br />  it was defn not for fun - i was doing a literal translation.</div></blockquote>I take it. Sorry for the misreading. <br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>So, the fact that Ottakoothar represented the thoughts of <br />  Kulothunga <br />    II by calling Thirumal as "SiRu dheivam" is itself an <br />undisputable <br />    testimony to the intolerance of Kulothunga II<br />  <br />  every shiva temple has the lingothbavar depiction defined in its <br />  canons of construction - so you mean that depicting in stone <br />doesnt <br />  tantamoung to intolerance while a court poet&#39;s verse does!!</div></blockquote>This at best is a very clever question. Remember, in your own words, <br />Lingothbavar was the central theme and others are participating <br />artists. And there is always a constraint for the sculptor regarding <br />the space available and he will only depict the central character <br />largely. But the case of Poet is totally different. While one can <br />find an equal of a sculptural depiction on both sides (I mean <br />Saivite and Vaishnavite), show me one verse composed by a poet, <br />singing about a King's tolearance level, by terming Siva as a Siru <br />Dheivam. Atleast I am not aware of one. Please do not take the <br />references the verses by Azhwars or Nayanmars as you know what to <br />expect out of them. <br /><br />Also the same King who built such a Siva temple would have built a <br />Vishnu temple in which Siva would have a demi-god status. But is <br />there any account which claims that Kulothunga II, threw away a <br />Sivalingam or a Nataraja into sea or fire to find more place for a <br />Vishnu Sannidhi. I am afraid not. So my statement regarding the <br />Prejudiced opinion about the Chola kings, making it difficult to <br />accept the intolerance towards Vaishnavites (of course I am <br />referring only to Kulothunga II here) still stands valid, logically.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But I see that, since an opinion is already formed about the <br />    generosity of the Chola Kings, it is hard to digest that one or <br />  two <br />    Chola Kings did exhibit some levels of intolerance. One need to <br />  have <br />    a paradigm shift to do an unbiased study to conclude. <br />  <br />  unbiased study - my kula deivam is yedukuntala vada - but that <br />  doesnt stop me from entering other temples not resctricted to <br />  hinduism alone, after all my friend we are at best 3rd in terms of <br />  world coverage.<br />  <br />    Afterall "yAnaikkum aDi sarukkum".

Koppanangal ordered, that the temple<br />  should be reopened and that its property<br />  should be restored."</div></blockquote>I am not aware of this. However I know of the character Koppana. He <br />was indeed the executive officer or a Chief Minister in the court of <br />Bukka and his son Kambana. He finds his name mentioned in Mathura <br />Vijayam a poem written by Kambana's wife regarding the Vijayanagar <br />Kingdoms invasion of the Islamic rulers of South India and <br />restoration of Srirangam and Madurai. His name also finds a mention <br />in the inscriptions on the walls of Srirangam temple and also in the <br />Koil Ozhugu for he was the principal man behind the efforts to <br />restore Ranganatha to Srirangam temple after 48 years of exile, <br />starting from the invasion of Ulugh Khan. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</div>

If this can be treated as a provocation, remember a tolerant<br />king, ideally, would only punish those who objected and created problem.<br />Not the Idol. So, if due to the provocation by the Vaishnavite priests<br />if Kulothunga II threw Govindarajar into the sea, it is only his<br />audacity and there is absolutely no reverence in this act as suggested<br />by SPS sir. This is what I am trying to convey.<br /><br />So it is a fact that Kulothunga II had much lesser tolerance. Okay let<br />us not term it as intolerance, but lesser reverence to Vishnu when<br />compared to Siva and that is what made him to throw the idol in the sea.<br />So we agree that the incident actually took place, but you only want to<br />know what was the provocation. I have stated the provocation too. So how<br />are we going to absolve Kulothunga II from the allegations of<br />intolerance (or) irreverance?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Venkatesh</div>

When you come <br />out of Thiruvarur Temple Sanctum (East facing, So southern exit), on <br />the South facing wall - you will find the pictorial depiction of <br />this.<br /><br />Our respected member Kathie has rightly put - Saivism and <br />Vaishanavism are intertwined in weaving the lovely Hindusim fabric.<br /><br />When a Scholar of Dr. Nagaswamy's stature is referring Ottakothar's <br />statement as NIRMALYAM, we have to bring this into open.<br /><br />When another Scholar SR Balasubramanian observes after discussing in <br />detail that Kulothunga I & St Ramanujar's rift was without evidence <br />that also has to be brought out ..  <br /><br /><br />If we think a Sculpture of present Govindaraja's magnitude is <br />identified as " Siru Deivam " by Ottakoothar then he has erred..<br /><br />But if Krishnas with almost 10 leelas, Ulagalandan, sitting vishnu + <br />2 Devis, standing Rama (Sri Rama was never alone without Sita + <br />Lakshman + Hanuman atleast) with " ARAVANAIYIL KIDANTHAN " as could <br />be seen from 7th Century hymns, I leave it you to name this entity <br />whether could have been as bigger as of present Sculpture..<br /><br />And in the entire Discussion the CURCIAL WORD CHITRA (picture) IS <br />NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION !<br /><br />We are all talking of Sculptures !!!<br /><br />I earlier concluded that Kulothunga II in his 18 years span has <br />contributed only to 5 temples including chidambaram + Srirangam. <br /><br />Please read on Kulothunga II.<br /><br />His officials behaved with (Independent) Authority..<br /><br />And Poet would have been more loyal than the King in certain issues..<br /><br />anbudan / sps<br />-----------------<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>the fact that Ottakoothar has reflected the thoughts of <br />Kulothunga <br />  II <br />    that he considered the Vishnu as "siRu dheivam" speaks of his <br />  lesser <br />    reverence for anyone other than Siva. <br />    <br />  <br />  <br />  Hi venkatesh<br />  <br />  Can you see the Urdhava thandavam sculpture of perur in the above <br />  link<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/05/27/stories/2005052700390300.htm">http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/05/27/stor ... 390300.htm</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  this sculpture is true to rendition of the dance form...&#40; had <br />posted <br />  an extract of the book on Nataraja by C. Sivaramoorthi earlier.... <br />  quoting the same at the end of the post&#41;<br />  <br />  Now brahma is shown with the chai chak sorry jalra &#40; opps sorry - <br />  ithukku per ennappa &#41;....and vishnu is playing the drum. Now you <br />  cannot fault the sculpture /artist....for he is following the <br />  dicition &#40; watch the size of paravati in the entire composition&#41; - <br />  interesting to note the the dwarf muhilagan&#39;s size in comparison <br />to <br />  vishnu, brahma and parvathi...<br />  <br />  now coming back to ottakutthar verse - in the context of this  <br />  sculptural composition mal siru deivam thane....<br />  <br />  rgds<br />  vj<br />  <br />  As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, in <br />  the<br />  loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the <br />goddess <br />  of<br />  prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />  nritta<br />  aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />  the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />  into<br />  light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />  prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord&#39;s <br />  musical<br />  orchestra: <br />  astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />  cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />  samalakshyata nakalakshmih &#40;Haravijya 19.5&#41;.<br />  <br />  This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />  music,<br />  Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping <br />time<br />  and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />  adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, <br />there <br />  is<br />  an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />  Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali: <br />  vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi tali<br />  nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />  &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11&#41; tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />hyaninditah<br />  &#40;Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21&#41; naikatanaratas svarah <br />&#40;Lingamahapurana <br />  1,<br />  65, 40&#41;. The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />provided<br />  with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />  innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of <br />the<br />  svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />  the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />  rathagitas cha &#40;Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44&#41;. Ratha is <br />Rathantarasama,<br />  by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva&#39;s fondness for Sama is <br />very<br />  well known.</div></blockquote></div>
