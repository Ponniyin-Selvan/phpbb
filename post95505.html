			<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />I think the haters of vanathy have totally<br />misunderstood her. I request those to go thru the book<br />again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br />practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br />many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br />end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.<br /><br />In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br />whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br />who could avenge her father's defeat before she met<br />arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br />was the another one. Kalki has mentioned very clearly<br />that at first she had only this thought of begetting a<br />son who is very brave. She often dreams about her son<br />coming to her after emerging as victorious in all the<br />battles he fought and thus making her proud. At this<br />stage, she is not really bothered about her husband to<br />be. He can be any X or Y.<br /><br />Once she met arulmozhi she thinks that she could not<br />accept anyone but arulmozhi as her husband. So her<br />thought of begetting a brave son becomes complex cause<br />now it has to be thru arulmozhi only. And now this<br />second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br />think about her first ambition. And there were many<br />pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br />though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br />get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br />is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br />meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br />Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br />very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br />to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur.<br /><br />Actually she is mentally very strong and sternly<br />follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br />she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br />actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br />that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br />may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br />thought came to arulmozhi's mind because of kundavai,<br />Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br />arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br />kundavai asks her why has she made such a terrible<br />vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br />theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br />ariyumbadi koorinen akka". So one can see that she is<br />not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br />sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br />her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br />this episode that arulmozhi just makes explicit his<br />hidden love for her.<br /><br />She is very stubborn also.She pays a deaf ear to<br />kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br />She asks for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>'s help but when he is not willing she<br />decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br />of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br />her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br />anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br /><br />Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br />remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br />argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br />is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br />quiet and calm manner.<br /><br />One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br />mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br />Kundavai doesn't come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br />tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br />wait for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and others to come for their wedding.<br /><br />So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />for her. He never does this to any other person.<br /><br />We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br />arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br />that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />she may become hinderous in achieving his goals.<br />Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br />that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br />wants. And so he decides to marry her.<br /><br />In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br />sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br />her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br />this but is totally unpredictable. Poonguzhali accepts<br />amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br />cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali's character<br />also.<br /><br />There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br />irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br />Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br />all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br />highlight.<br /><br />Priya.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Looking for last minute shopping deals?<br />Find them fast with Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Wow Priya<br />Very Good Analysis. Congrats!<br />Shobha<br /><br />Priya Jayaraman  wrote: <br />Hi All,<br /><br />I think the haters of vanathy have totally<br />misunderstood her. I request those to go thru the book<br />again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br />practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br />many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br />end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.<br /><br />In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br />whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br />who could avenge her father's defeat before she met<br />arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br />was the another one. Kalki has mentioned very clearly<br />that at first she had only this thought of begetting a<br />son who is very brave. She often dreams about her son<br />coming to her after emerging as victorious in all the<br />battles he fought and thus making her proud. At this<br />stage, she is not really bothered about her husband to<br />be. He can be any X or Y.<br /><br />Once she met arulmozhi she thinks that she could not<br />accept anyone but arulmozhi as her husband. So her<br />thought of begetting a brave son becomes complex cause<br />now it has to be thru arulmozhi only. And now this<br />second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br />think about her first ambition. And there were many<br />pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br />though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br />get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br />is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br />meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br />Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br />very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br />to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur.<br /><br />Actually she is mentally very strong and sternly<br />follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br />she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br />actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br />that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br />may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br />thought came to arulmozhi's mind because of kundavai,<br />Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br />arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br />kundavai asks her why has she made such a terrible<br />vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br />theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br />ariyumbadi koorinen akka". So one can see that she is<br />not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br />sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br />her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br />this episode that arulmozhi just makes explicit his<br />hidden love for her.<br /><br />She is very stubborn also.She pays a deaf ear to<br />kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br />She asks for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>'s help but when he is not willing she<br />decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br />of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br />her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br />anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br /><br />Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br />remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br />argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br />is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br />quiet and calm manner.<br /><br />One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br />mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br />Kundavai doesn't come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br />tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br />wait for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and others to come for their wedding.<br /><br />So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />for her. He never does this to any other person.<br /><br />We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br />arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br />that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />she may become hinderous in achieving his goals.<br />Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br />that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br />wants. And so he decides to marry her.<br /><br />In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br />sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br />her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br />this but is totally unpredictable. Poonguzhali accepts<br />amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br />cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali's character<br />also.<br /><br />There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br />irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br />Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br />all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br />highlight.<br /><br />Priya.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Looking for last minute shopping deals?<br />Find them fast with Yahoo!

So one can see that she is<br />    not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br />    sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br />    her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br />    this episode that arulmozhi just makes explicit his<br />    hidden love for her.<br />    <br />    She is very stubborn also.She pays a deaf ear to<br />    kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br />    She asks for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>&#39;s help but when he is not willing she<br />    decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br />    of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br />    her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br />    anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.<br />    <br />    Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br />    remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br />    argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br />    is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br />    quiet and calm manner. <br />    <br />    One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br />    mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br />    Kundavai doesn&#39;t come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br />    tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />    nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />    And finally he does that also. That&#39;s why they didn&#39;t<br />    wait for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and others to come for their wedding.<br />      <br />    So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />    own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />    Arulmozhi&#39;s teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />    for her. He never does this to any other person.<br />    <br />    We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />    personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />    and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br />    arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br />    that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />    she may become hinderous in achieving his goals. <br />    Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />    stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br />    that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br />    wants. And so he decides to marry her. <br />    <br />    In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br />    sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br />    her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br />    this but is totally unpredictable. Poonguzhali accepts<br />    amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br />    cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali&#39;s character<br />    also. <br />    <br />    There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br />    irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br />    Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br />    all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br />    highlight.<br />    <br />    Priya. <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />          <br />  <br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />  _______________<br />    Looking for last minute shopping deals?  <br />    Find them fast with Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Hi Priya,<br /><br />That was fantastic analysis of Vanthi. After seeing so many bashes on<br />her, your post was quiet a change to read.<br /><br />regards,<br />siva.<br /><br />On Jan 27, 2008 11:45 PM, Priya Jayaraman  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi All,<br /> <br />  I think the haters of vanathy have totally<br />  misunderstood her. I request those to go thru the book<br />  again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br />  practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br />  many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br />  end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.<br /> <br />  In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br />  whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br />  who could avenge her father&#39;s defeat before she met<br />  arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br />  was the another one. Kalki has mentioned very clearly<br />  that at first she had only this thought of begetting a<br />  son who is very brave. She often dreams about her son<br />  coming to her after emerging as victorious in all the<br />  battles he fought and thus making her proud. At this<br />  stage, she is not really bothered about her husband to<br />  be. He can be any X or Y.<br /> <br />  Once she met arulmozhi she thinks that she could not<br />  accept anyone but arulmozhi as her husband. So her<br />  thought of begetting a brave son becomes complex cause<br />  now it has to be thru arulmozhi only. And now this<br />  second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br />  think about her first ambition. And there were many<br />  pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br />  though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br />  get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br />  is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br />  meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br />  Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br />  very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br />  to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur.<br /> <br />  Actually she is mentally very strong and sternly<br />  follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br />  she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br />  actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br />  that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br />  may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br />  thought came to arulmozhi&#39;s mind because of kundavai,<br />  Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br />  arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br />  kundavai asks her why has she made such a terrible<br />  vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br />  theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br />  ariyumbadi koorinen akka".
