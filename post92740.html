I have heard the story from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office in Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>raid sirens blew, and they all ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get into one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of his chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and somehow, in that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor ( a lady) had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my grandfather collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His family, consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids (my mom wasn't born then) of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to what happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my grandmother the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited<br />the hospital and eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by train to Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through exhaustion and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to perish, according to him.<br /><br />There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles eventually passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences">AIIMS</acronym> as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady doctor who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her house to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a doctor because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.<br /><br />I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the right side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used to touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin tissue between my finger and the whole.<br /><br />I have always wanted to write a story about this. Maybe I will <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 11/16/06, sridhar rathinam  wrote:<br />Dear Suganya<br />Thanks part of the Chunk is mine I dont know if I confused Vettri thirunagar with this in that mail<br />Regards<br />Sri<br /><br />Suganya  wrote:<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />neither<br />the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />nayakkars<br />and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.<br /><br />There wont be a hot reply because we are just dicussing books<br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dear Sri,<br /><br />I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel on<br />Nayakars.<br /><br />I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It is<br />an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and bravery<br />between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani<br />Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story.<br /><br />I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read.<br /><br />-Suganya<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sridhar Rathinam"<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear All<br />  Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on<br />  Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />  Reagrds<br />  Sri<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  Dear Vaithi<br /> <br />  I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki<br />  but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading<br />  Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th<br />  time. ,<br /> <br />    The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his<br />  Adimai..Hippalas&#40;Yavanarani&#41; Moor samath&#40;Vijayamahadevi&#41;...Amir&#40;<br />  Kadal Pura&#41;<br /> <br />  Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />  its<br />  Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats<br />  their<br />  style. Now I<br />  dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is<br />  the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a<br />  sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.<br /> <br />    One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times<br />  a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym><br />  more than the normal...<br /> <br />  What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the<br />  individuals<br />  concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it<br />  and<br />  later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I<br />  feel.<br />  &#40;Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir&#41;<br /> <br /> <br />  Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type<br />  panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to<br />  finish reading the<br />  book. I dont<br />  deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced<br />  masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to<br />  call for an epic status in thamil is<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Sandilyans work are more<br />  masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the<br />  will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will<br />  be roaring success <br />  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />    Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero...<br />    The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy<br />  is not<br />  expecting...<br />  This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero<br />  senja<br />  then the villain becomes a hero.<br />  what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in<br />  kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same<br />  tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the<br />  same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides<br />  guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />    the other irritating <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> in his style is ending a chapter in a<br />  suspense<br />  note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards<br />  that<br />  suspense and by then that chapter will end...<br /> <br />  Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu<br />  illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera<br />  ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />  HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />  Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni<br />  anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If<br />  that was what they need that was it.<br /> <br />    Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to<br />  other<br />  authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight<br />  among<br />  themselves.<br /> <br />  Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the<br />  females<br />  played great roles in administering our territories?<br />  Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping<br />  the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not<br />  administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum<br />  greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are<br />  depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding<br />  them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad<br />  on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like<br />  Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />    Akilan<br />    Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the<br />  same time<br />  doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more<br />  charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan<br />  had 4<br />  main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the<br />  times<br />  and turmoils are well illustarted.<br /> <br />  I really feel personally that a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of romance in vengaiyin<br />  mainthan<br />  would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that<br />  when<br />  lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be<br />  away,<br />  chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />    There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of<br />  Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing<br />  Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the<br />  latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love<br />  life&#40;physical..&#41;Its just the author chooses to ignore it...<br />  I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and<br />  rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />    Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should<br />  not<br />  write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura<br />  nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who<br />  seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />  Rajendra is<br />  done as a confusion&#40;well vanathi in sithapiramai etc&#41;<br /> <br />  Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go<br />  in<br />  search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would<br />  have read<br />  <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have<br />  been<br />  your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing<br />  the same<br />  situation from a different angle.<br />  Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what<br />  do you say about NN<br />  And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />  neither<br />  the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />  nayakkars<br />  and the cholas&#40;after thirumalai nayakkar&#41;.That was also really pacy.<br /> <br />  There wont be a hot reply because we are just dicussing books<br /> <br />  Love<br />  Sridhar<br />  Yahoo!

I have heard the<br />  story from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office<br />  in Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>raid sirens blew, and they<br />  all ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get<br />  into one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of<br />  his chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and somehow,<br />  in that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor &#40; a<br />  lady&#41; had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my<br />  grandfather collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me".<br />  His family, consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids &#40;my mom<br />  wasn&#39;t born then&#41; of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue<br />  as to what happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my<br />  grandmother the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited the<br />  hospital and eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated<br />  by train to Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in<br />  that enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He<br />  mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through exhaustion<br />  and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to<br />  perish, according to him.<br /> <br />  There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles eventually<br />  passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences">AIIMS</acronym> as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady doctor<br />  who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her house<br />  to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a doctor<br />  because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.<br /> <br />  I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the right<br />  side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade...

It is<br />    an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and bravery<br />    between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />    generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani<br />    Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story.<br />   <br />    I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read.<br />   <br />    -Suganya<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />    "Sridhar Rathinam"<br />     wrote:<br />     <br />      Dear All<br />      Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on<br />      Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />      Reagrds<br />      Sri<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      Dear Vaithi<br />     <br />      I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki<br />      but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading<br />      Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th<br />      time. ,<br />     <br />        The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his<br />      Adimai..Hippalas&#40;Yavanarani&#41; Moor samath&#40;Vijayamahadevi&#41;...Amir&#40;<br />      Kadal Pura&#41;<br />     <br />      Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym><br />      its<br />      Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats<br />      their<br />      style. Now I<br />      dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is<br />      the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a<br />      sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.<br />     <br />        One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times<br />      a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym><br />      more than the normal...<br />     <br />      What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the<br />      individuals<br />      concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it<br />      and<br />      later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I<br />      feel.<br />      &#40;Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir&#41;<br />     <br />     <br />      Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type<br />      panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to<br />      finish reading the<br />      book. I dont<br />      deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced<br />      masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to<br />      call for an epic status in thamil is<br />      <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> Sandilyans work are more<br />      masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the<br />      will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will<br />      be roaring success <br />      The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />        Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero...<br />        The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy<br />      is not<br />      expecting...<br />      This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero<br />      senja<br />      then the villain becomes a hero.<br />      what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in<br />      kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same<br />      tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the<br />      same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides<br />      guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />        the other irritating <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> in his style is ending a chapter in a<br />      suspense<br />      note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards<br />      that<br />      suspense and by then that chapter will end...<br />     <br />      Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu<br />      illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera<br />      ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />      HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />      Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni<br />      anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If<br />      that was what they need that was it.<br />     <br />        Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to<br />      other<br />      authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight<br />      among<br />      themselves.<br />     <br />      Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the<br />      females<br />      played great roles in administering our territories?<br />      Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping<br />      the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not<br />      administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum<br />      greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are<br />      depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding<br />      them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad<br />      on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like<br />      Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />        Akilan<br />        Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the<br />      same time<br />      doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more<br />      charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan<br />      had 4<br />      main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the<br />      times<br />      and turmoils are well illustarted.<br />     <br />      I really feel personally that a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of romance in vengaiyin<br />      mainthan<br />      would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that<br />      when<br />      lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be<br />      away,<br />      chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />        There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of<br />      Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing<br />      Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the<br />      latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love<br />      life&#40;physical..&#41;Its just the author chooses to ignore it...<br />      I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and<br />      rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />        Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should<br />      not<br />      write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura<br />      nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who<br />      seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />      Rajendra is<br />      done as a confusion&#40;well vanathi in sithapiramai etc&#41;<br />     <br />      Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go<br />      in<br />      search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would<br />      have read<br />      <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have<br />      been<br />      your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing<br />      the same<br />      situation from a different angle.<br />      Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what<br />      do you say about NN<br />      And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />      neither<br />      the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />      nayakkars<br />      and the cholas&#40;after thirumalai nayakkar&#41;.That was also really pacy.<br />     <br />      There wont be a hot reply because we are just dicussing books<br />     <br />      Love<br />      Sridhar<br />      Yahoo!

I have heard the<br />  story<br />    from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office<br />  in<br />    Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>raid sirens blew, and<br />  they all<br />    ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get<br />  into<br />    one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of<br />  his<br />    chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and<br />  somehow, in<br />    that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor &#40; a<br />  lady&#41;<br />    had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my<br />  grandfather<br />    collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His<br />  family,<br />    consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids &#40;my mom<br />  wasn&#39;t born<br />    then&#41; of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to<br />  what<br />    happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my<br />  grandmother<br />    the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited the<br />  hospital and<br />    eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by<br />  train to<br />    Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that<br />    enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He<br />    mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through<br />  exhaustion<br />    and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to<br />    perish, according to him.<br />   <br />    There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles<br />  eventually<br />    passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences">AIIMS</acronym> as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady<br />  doctor<br />    who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her<br />  house<br />    to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a<br />  doctor<br />    because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.<br />   <br />    I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the<br />  right<br />    side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used<br />  to<br />    touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin<br />  tissue<br />    between my finger and the whole.<br />   <br />    I have always wanted to write a story about this.

One of the 'class apart' <br />personality I have come across. I think the members will agree with <br />me to credit you with the title 'THE GREAT', if not in Indian/tamil <br />history, atleast in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> group history. <br /><br />Kamal's title to you - Seyal Puyal Sundar - very much apt..<br /><br />Kamal and Arun,and others in Japan,<br /><br />I too heard the news of Tsunami warning and wanted to enquire. Good <br />to know that nothing serious happened. Great god.<br /><br />Sri,<br />Eager to meet you in Feb. If you can share your program details, <br />probably we can start planning for a short trip. As SPS said, lets <br />try to make this a rememberable trip <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>
