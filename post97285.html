			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />Ok here's my tuppence worth. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a work of historical fiction. No one can <br />refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something like that, it is either <br />out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case) or out of arrogance <br />(which might be the case). However, despite that, we have to realize that he <br />is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. If we all love <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and <br />Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who disagrees with us or <br />disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just his opinion, just as the <br />fact that we think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is good is just our opinion. Also, one doesn't need to <br />be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash Ganguly now, does one? Or be <br />a politician to comment on politics. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Similarly, <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, one does not need <br />to be a great writer to critique novels. <br /><br />My 0.02 $ worth!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br /><br />On 6/15/05, Sivapathasekaran  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, sridhar rathinam<br />   wrote:<br />    Dear All<br />    One of the reasons why I kept quiet was that I havent read any of<br />  Prabanjans novels..But I was taken ababck by his staement not that<br />  thats going to alter PSs tall stature in Tamil Literature.<br />   <br />    He defended his Vanam Vasapadum but said what is historic novel man<br />  chases woman and they are prine and princess and I have written about<br />  common men in my book....<br />   <br />    ====================<br />  Dear Sridhar,<br />  <br />  I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on mail.<br />  <br />  If one goes through the replies of the person aged about 56 to<br />  various questions, the concentration is more on Love / Women /<br />  Actressess and the alike..<br />  <br />  Any further discussion on this will only drag us out of scope of our<br />  main line of communications ...<br />  <br />  There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman - at Thillaisthanam<br />  &#40;near Thiruvaiyaru&#41; - who wrote some interesting Social Novels with<br />  Army back-ground.

			<div class="content">Dr.Arunkrishnan,<br /><br />Prabanchan has every right to criticize <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.Without literary<br />criticism no field will grow.I found fault with the logic of<br />prabanchan.He says<br /><br />"A historic novel should not focus on lives of kings and princes.It<br />should focus on life of commoners.Historic novels which dont do so<br />arent qualified to be called as historic novels.So far only my novel<br />has focussed on commoners.Thus this is the first historic novel in<br />Tamil"<br /><br />I found fault with his criticisms on the following grounds.<br /><br />1.Greatest historical epics like macbeth,julius<br />ceaser,illiad,odyssey were written about the lives of kings and<br />queens.Are they historical novels or not?<br /><br />2.Writing about commoners is one method of writing historic<br />novels."Pillars of earth" is one such great novel.But how can we say<br />other forms of novels cannot qualify as hitoric novels?<br /><br />It is these faults which I pointed out.<br /><br />regards<br />sampath</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Vijay,<br /><br />I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't <br />say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his <br />opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of <br />course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his <br />opinion. Who was it who said that "*I disapprove of what you say, but I will <br />defend to the death your right to say it*"? Or words to that effect.. <br /><br />I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of Googling got me this :<br /><br />This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely <br />attributed to the French writer<br />Voltaire,<br />that master of liberal philosophy renowned for *his* satirical wit.<br />FranÃ§ois-Marie<br />Arouet <br />(Voltairewas<br />*his* nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the <br />18th-century intellectual movement known as the<br />Enlightenment.<br />*His* tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to <br />established views, and *his* biting commentaries twice led to<br />*his*imprisonment, and eventually, to<br />*his* exile to England. <br /><br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment <br />you quote. According to a number of web<br />sites,<br />"The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of *his* attitude." <br />It comes from *The Friends of Voltaire*, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and <br />published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that <br />she paraphrased Voltaire's words in *his* "*Treatise on<br />Toleration*,"<br />which includes such thoughts as: <br /><br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do <br />not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous <br />to declare their eternal damnation.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/17/05, Vijay Veerasamy  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Kalki&#39;s <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not complete fiction.

FranÃ§ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England.<br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as:<br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,<br /><br />Arun<br /><br />On 6/17/05, Vijay Veerasamy  wrote:Kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not complete fiction.

			<div class="content">Hi Arun,<br /><br />I agree with you that people should be able to express<br />their opinions. In my view, his opinion was basically<br />regarding what is a historic novel. What Prabhanjan<br />did was to redefine in his own way a commonly<br />understood term , "historic novel". The justification<br />he provides (common man ...) is not convincing. He<br />did not criticise <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, but the way people use the term<br />"historic novel". In his world, all such novels are<br />called by some other name. I guess he does have a<br />contorted view of the world.<br /><br />-Arul.<br /><br />--- Arun Krishnan  wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Vijay,<br /> <br />  I strongly believe that everybody has a right to<br />  his/her opinions.

			<div class="content">I just had a rapid glimpse of the discussion. Have couple of thoughts <br />on it, <br /><br />1) History is an ever growing field, with advances in <br />anthropology/archaelogy and epigraphic evidences shed more light over <br />it, we find lot of things we thought was history being proved wrong.<br /><br />So if we are to judge <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> by historical factuality, we have to take <br />into consideration the availability of sources at the time kalki <br />wrote it.<br /><br />2) Another blame on historical fiction is that they focus too much on <br />kings and less on cabbages. Love and war are the primary ingrediants. <br /><br />Again <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a groundbreaking work in that aspect too. In fact <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> has <br />some many enjoyable down to earth daily routine info/imaginations like<br />Vandiyadevan's repast at Sendan Amuthan's place " Thengai paalum, <br />idiyappamum vayir mutta undaan..". Though I do enjoy other authors <br />are Candilyan, this is one of the hall marks of Kalki.<br /><br />Points and Counter points apart.<br /><br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> has a hallowed place not just because it is a good literature, but <br />because it inspired thousands to know thier history and inspired <br />historical explorations and other literary works and what not.<br /><br />So irrespective of factuality or belonging to any genre. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a <br />phenomenon.<br /><br />However Prabanchan's perspective may not be the same, being a creator <br />in his own right, it is innate in him to challenge the existing order.<br /><br />Raghu<br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, dhiwakar baskaran <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dears,<br />   <br />  i think we are becoming too obsessed with Prabanchan and deviating <br />from the purpose.....<br />   <br />  It is like Ravana being too obsessed with Rama , whereby he lost <br />all his virtues and ultimately perished.......&#40;pls do not start a</div></blockquote>thread as to whether is right to compare Rama with Prabanchan and us <br />with Ravana)...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>by concentrating too much on prabanchan, we are losing our <br />focus.....<br />   <br />  today, even a great Person like "Mahatma Gandhi" is not above <br />Criticism.. so accept it as a way of life...<br />   <br />  With Regards<br />   <br />  B.

No one can<br />    refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />    like that, it is either<br />    out of ignorance &#40;which I don&#39;t think is the case&#41;<br />    or out of arrogance<br />    &#40;which might be the case&#41;. However, despite that, we<br />    have to realize that he<br />    is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />    If we all love <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and<br />    Kalki&#39;s works, it doesn&#39;t mean that anyone who<br />    disagrees with us or<br />    disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />    his opinion, just as the<br />    fact that we think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is good is just our opinion. <br />    Also, one doesn&#39;t need to<br />    be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />    Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />    a politician to comment on politics. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-&#41;" title="Smile" /> Similarly,<br />    <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, one does not need<br />    to be a great writer to critique novels.<br />   <br />    My 0.02 $ worth!<br />   <br />    Cheers,<br />   <br />    Arun<br />   <br />   <br />    On 6/15/05, Sivapathasekaran<br />    < sps10142004@y...  wrote:<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, sridhar<br />    rathinam<br />       wrote: <br />        Dear All<br />        One of the reasons why I kept quiet was that I<br />    havent read any of<br />      Prabanjans novels..But I was taken ababck by his<br />    staement not that<br />      thats going to alter PSs tall stature in Tamil <br />    Literature.<br />       <br />        He defended his Vanam Vasapadum but said what is<br />    historic novel man<br />      chases woman and they are prine and princess and I<br />    have written about <br />      common men in my book....<br />       <br />        ====================<br />      Dear Sridhar,<br />     <br />      I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />    mail.<br />      <br />      If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />    about 56 to<br />      various questions, the concentration is more on<br />    Love / Women /<br />      Actressess and the alike..<br />      <br />      Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />    out of scope of our<br />      main line of communications ...<br />     <br />      There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />    - at Thillaisthanam <br />      &#40;near Thiruvaiyaru&#41; - who wrote some interesting<br />    Social Novels with<br />      Army back-ground.
