			<div class="content"><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Telugu kings ruled tamilnadu till 18th century.The last queen was<br />  rani meenakshi.after that it was british</div></blockquote>Dear priya<br /><br />That was an excellent narriation. "Thiruvarangan Ula" a masterpiece<br />by sri venugopalan - 4 parts covers the whole story in great detail.<br />But things like the exact no of soldiers which you have quoted is<br />not there in the book I believe. Not sure whether you took it from<br />madhura vijayam. Yes, Kambana did take the idol with him but might<br />not have carried it on his head - it is pretty heavy.<br /><br />The story of kambana udaiyar does not end here. He continued to<br />reinstall and reinitiate many of the temple worships across<br />tamilnadu. For around 100 years the whole temple worship process had<br />almost been forgotten and many things had to be referred from the<br />elders.(sultans had ordered closure of all temples across the land)<br /><br />There are several inscriptions of kambana across tamilnadu that<br />speak volumes about his vital contribution.<br /><br />Not satisfied with this, kambana and the successors of vijayanagar<br />took all care to rebuild temples and sometimes if a specific temple<br />was in highly dilapated state, they moved the stone idols and<br />pillars to a nearby temple. That's why sometimes we find unique<br />combinations and inscriptions in some of the temples. Sarangapany<br />temple, nandhipuram temple..are few examples where this has happened.<br /><br />I hope you also know that before the actual ranganatha could be<br />installed srirangam people had already started worshipping another<br />idol - we find him in srirangam even today. There is an interesting<br />story as to how it was proved that the idol carried by kambana was<br />infact the original ancient deity of srirangam.<br /><br />Anbudan<br />Gokul.S</div>

More such informations will enlighten<br />  the<br />    group members. Thanks a lot for your service rendered.<br />   <br />    While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that,<br />  in<br />    the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except<br />  the<br />    europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />    story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu<br />  was<br />    never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the<br />  whole<br />    of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />    enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to<br />  come<br />    till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably<br />    the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to<br />    come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country<br />    through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.<br />   <br />    Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great<br />  in<br />    sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />    seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the<br />  chola<br />    kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />    outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is<br />  many<br />    of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.<br />   <br />    I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due<br />  respect<br />    the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />    westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and<br />  wanted<br />    to show their supremacy. Alexander is called &#39;The Great&#39; all over<br />  the<br />    world. But he was almost defeated by an Indian<br />  King &#39;Purushotaman&#39;.<br />    Thats why Alexander made friendship with him and returned without<br />    further conquering. But this is not highlighted inthe world<br />    History.IF Alexander is called great, then Ashoka should also be<br />    called &#39;The Great&#39; and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> sh ould also be called &#39;The<br />  Great&#39;.<br />    In India alone, Ashoka is called the Great, but even in India <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />  and<br />    <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> are not called as the great. This disparity shown by the<br />    northerners towards southerners is heart breaking.<br />   <br />    What can be done to bring such things to the lime light? Why<br />  doesnt<br />    the so called &#39;Tamil saviours&#39; the DK&#39;s and the DMK&#39;s talk about<br />    these facts...any inputs from the learned people?

Thanks a lot for your service rendered.<br />   <br />    While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that,<br />  in<br />    the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except<br />  the<br />    europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />    story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu<br />  was<br />    never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the<br />  whole<br />    of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />    enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to<br />  come<br />    till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably<br />    the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to<br />    come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country<br />    through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.<br />   <br />    Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great<br />  in<br />    sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />    seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the<br />  chola<br />    kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />    outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is<br />  many<br />    of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.<br />   <br />    I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due<br />  respect<br />    the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />    westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and<br />  wanted<br />    to show their supremacy. Alexander is called &#39;The Great&#39; all over<br />  the<br />    world. But he was almost defeated by an Indian<br />  King &#39;Purushotaman&#39;.<br />    Thats why Alexander made friendship with him and returned without<br />    further conquering. But this is not highlighted inthe world<br />    History.IF Alexander is called great, then Ashoka should also be<br />    called &#39;The Great&#39; and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> sh ould also be called &#39;The<br />  Great&#39;.<br />    In India alone, Ashoka is called the Great, but even in India <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />  and<br />    <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym> are not called as the great. This disparity shown by the<br />    northerners towards southerners is heart breaking.<br />   <br />    What can be done to bring such things to the lime light? Why<br />  doesnt<br />    the so called &#39;Tamil saviours&#39; the DK&#39;s and the DMK&#39;s talk about<br />    these facts...any inputs from the learned people?

			<div class="content">Dear Suganya<br />I agree with you perfectly except one thing...I think Yavanarani was Sandilyans best byfar.<br /><br />As far Kadalpura it was based on the circumstances which led to the Kalinga war and lead to the creation of Kalingathu parani praising the achievement of Kulothungan and Karunagara thondaimaan by jeyankondar<br /><br />If you read the Mugavurai by Prof Dr N Subramanian you ll understand its a historic novel and not a karpanai kaaviyam in a different period<br /><br />Infact he things Kulothunga's name on ascension is an inspiration of the Srivijaya kings who were Vijayothungan...Kumarathungan etc....<br /><br />There was a mail about Purvadesam recently He thinks Purvadesam is actually Indo China which is present day Vietnam Combodia and Laos.....<br /><br /><br />So it was a fiction based on a strong historic background<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br />suganya_ml  wrote:<br /><br /><br />Rajendran,<br /><br />Pls dont say that Kadal Pura is a imaginory story. May not be to bits<br />and pieces but it is very much a real story.<br /><br />Kulothunga Cholan is the famous king in Chola era after <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym> and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJ</acronym>.<br />There are lot of evidences in Chinese history that he had a huge Chola<br />army in Southern China after his expeditions to South East and its<br />conquest.<br /><br />Also many evidences about him conquering Kadaram during the quarrel<br />between the kings of Kadaram and Sri Vijayam. Infact, it is said that<br />he made the border line between these two kingdoms and made the<br />respective kings to sit on the thrones and monitored them from Souther<br />n China.<br /><br />Kulothunga's former name is Anabhayan as well. He ascended the Chola<br />throne after ViraRajendran (Rajendra II). He is not the son of<br />ViraRajendran instead nephew of him.<br /><br />ViraRajendran was also a great warrior but didn't go out of India.
