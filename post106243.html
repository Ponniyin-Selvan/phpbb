			<div class="content">Mr Venketesh,<br /><br />To answer straight, yes, the Thenkalai signs "were" prevalent and <br />they were the only ones prevalent. I am not trying to be biased here <br />but let me present just one proof here. I have already discussed the <br />logic behind Thenkalais only being prevalent during those times in <br />the article that I said I have written. I would like to present it <br />only if some one is interested. Please do not think that I am trying <br />to build-up here. Actually I wrote that article during one of the <br />debates on the Vadakalai and Thenkalai issues. That is the reason, I <br />am asking for the permission to write about it here.<br /><br />Now for the example/proof about the Thenkalai namam. Again I will <br />take refuge under the Srivaishnava Kulapathi Nammazhwar. In his <br />Thiruvaimozhi, he sings about the style of the namam. He says.....<br /><br />netRiyuL ninRu ennai AaLum niRai malarp pAdhangaL sooDi......<br /><br />Note the words, "niRai malarp pAdhangaL". I am sure you would all <br />have noticed at some point of time that it is only the Thenkalai <br />namam which depicted as the two legs of Vishnu over the Lotus flower <br />with Lakshmi embedded between the legs. This just is one example. <br />Incidentally this is the only reference to any namam of any sort in <br />all the 4000 Divya Prabhandams. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the <br />    other&#39;s views. Let us leave it at that. <br />  <br />  its not the philosphy but just if the signs of thenkalai were <br />  prevalent during the date of the story line.<br />  <br />  just like the rajagopurams of chidambaram are shown in the song , <br />but <br />  its doubtful if thillai had a rajagopuram at that time.<br />  <br />  <br />    <br />    Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as <br />    Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. <br />  <br />  <br />  the song mentions his name as vishnudasan son of rajya lakshmi and <br />  srinivasan&#40; incidentally the names of his real parents.<br />  <br />  <br />  venketesh</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Absolutely true...<br /> <br />Thillai incident doesnâ€™t have any connection with that of Kurathazvan incident... as the later incident took place some where near sri rangam, and very much before the Thillai incident<br />And lord Govindarajar was established in kizh tirupathi...By this time Sri.Ramanujar was very old... Some where nearing his 100s.. and it was one of shiyas or nambis who went along with the Govindarajar into the sea.. Thirupathi as a whole used to be domicile for all our lords from down south, weather its muslim invasion or internal problems.... be it Lord Sri Ranganatha..or Govindharajar...  <br />some body was asking about astaksharam.. the same refers to the name of thelord "om namo narayanaya"... this the one mentioned in the dasavatharam song... <br />and this is manthra which sri ramanujar gave into the whole world going on the top of the temple announcing the same to the whole world.. The way to get moksha even if he goes to hell...<br /> <br />Scholars pls do correct me, if I am wrong..<br /><br />and a wonderfull article on Sri.Ramanujar<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2002/05/10/stories/2002051001010800.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2 ... 010800.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Sent: Saturday, May 3, 2008 7:30:23 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Dasavatharam :: Trailer link<br /><br />Mr Venketesh<br /><br />The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial debate going on <br />between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The thenkalais claim that <br />vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only after Ramanuja, but <br />only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in the Guruparampara. <br />The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated from Pillai <br />Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br /><br />This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the <br />other's views. Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters into a <br />philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup <br />regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on that <br />debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it is <br />subject to a debate.<br /><br />Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. He <br />attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines <br />which all the historians accept unopposed.<br /><br />Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the <br />Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though <br />within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that <br />Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and got <br />it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was <br />reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere (may be in <br />this group itself) that He was reinstated during the times of Nayak <br />kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.<br /><br />Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as <br />Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of <br />Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the <br />history. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi<br />  so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />  <br />  i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41; instruments used on ramanuja <br />  himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were discovered in a <br />  secret chamber in the last decade<br />  <br />  .     So if he still has taken such a <br />  scene <br />    like King asking Ramanuja instead of Koorathazhwan to recite the <br />    verses, <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />    <br />     <br />      This person im talking about also has the tatoo &#40;or is it <br />burned <br />    into the<br />      skin? Can somebody confirm this?&#41; on his bicep. <br />  <br />  <br />  rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam&#40; straight lined like a <br />  trident rather than the U of vadakalai&#41;<br />  <br />  but one doubt??<br />  didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then how does he do <br />this <br />  say some 50 years prior?<br />  <br />  <br />  can sps clarify the timelines of<br />  <br />  a. ramanuja<br />  b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and the sea dropping.<br />  <br />  isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja recovered it and placed <br />  it in kizh tirupathi??? ??<br />  <br />  venketesh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  They are not <br />    allowed to have<br />      a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in that particular <br />  scene.<br />      I think its pretty hard to stick with the legend in the movie. <br />    Maybe Kamal<br />      just took the cusp and formed a creative story based on that. <br />The <br />    movie<br />      should clear this up.<br />      <br />      Regards<br />      Rahul<br />      <br />      On 5/3/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  wrote: <br />       <br />        Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK. <br />Actually <br />    according<br />        to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the <br />  stories <br />    of<br />        all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni <br />until<br />        Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the Chola <br />    King to<br />        recite Siva&#39;s name as supreme.<br />       <br />        The story goes thus: &#40;As taken from the book "Guruparampara <br />    Prabhavam"&#41;<br />       <br />        ..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri <br />for <br />  his<br />        bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and <br />    informed that<br />        the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about <br />the<br />        Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the <br />    foremost<br />        disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of <br />the<br />        meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya <br />and <br />    hence he<br />        silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with <br />    Periya<br />        Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the <br />Chola <br />    King in<br />        the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples <br />of<br />        Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked <br />  them <br />    to<br />        prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though <br />  Ramanuja <br />    did<br />        not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that <br />  Koorathazhwan <br />    has<br />        already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure <br />by <br />    his<br />        other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of <br />his <br />    Acharya<br />        &#40;Periya Nambi&#41; and his Sishya &#40;Koorathazhwan&#41; , left for <br />Melkote <br />  in<br />        present day Karnataka.<br />       <br />        Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However, <br />there <br />    was a<br />        minister by name "Naalooran" in King&#39;s court, who was once <br />    supposed to<br />        have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified <br />  him<br />        &#40;traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery <br />  to <br />    utmost<br />        concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to <br />be<br />        deciphered&#41; as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained <br />    Koorathazhwan to<br />        write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The <br />    wording that<br />        Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam <br />  nAsthi".<br />        Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course <br />  Koorathazhwan <br />    did<br />        write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha <br />    param".<br />        Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than &#39;sivam". In older <br />days <br />    the<br />        words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam <br />  was <br />    larger<br />        in measurement than sivam.<br />       <br />        On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked <br />  the <br />    eyes<br />        of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi. <br />    However<br />        Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my <br />eyes. <br />  I <br />    will<br />        do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and <br />    plucks it<br />        himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.<br />       <br />        This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-<br />up <br />  in <br />    the<br />        screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true. <br />  However <br />    we<br />        cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for <br />    ourselves.<br />       <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />       <br />        --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com    40yahoogroups. com ,<br />        "Humble Groups"<br />         wrote: <br />         <br />          I just saw Kalaignar&#39;s note about the first scene.

			<div class="content">Hi Malathi;<br />Your views on Kamal are pretty much same as what my mother has about him.<br />She simply cant stand him. Maybe there is something about Brahmin ladies and<br />thier hatred toward Kamal <br />He is a truly wonderful actor and an incredible talent, i dont think we can<br />argue about that.<br /><br />I think Mr.Venketesh (the author, there are too many venketesh's here <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />) is right. Kamal just plays a priest in the temple who is thrown along with<br />the idol into the ocean.

			<div class="content">Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is getting crazy <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<br />You writings are very informative. Have you written in this group before? If<br />so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do keep this going.<br />If these are your first mails then i presume on seeing this topic the<br />Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no offence, just a joke).<br />This happens when my father and my family friend (the one i was talking<br />about earlier) start having a chat about thier visit to the meenakshi<br />temple. This family friend (im delibrately refraining from naming him)<br />doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father, being a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement and it keeps continuing.<br />For an arguement and topic which has been going on for more than 10<br />centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.<br /><br />I just wanted to convey this, this is also a pretty sensitive topic hence i<br />request our members to tread VERY carefully and refrain from hurting<br />another's feelings. In the name of democracy and openess of society we seem<br />to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron hand is required so i<br />request our moderators to keep a watch on these threads and mercilessy<br />delete any mails which might seem offensive.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 5/3/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Mr Venketesh<br /> <br />  The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial debate going on<br />  between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The thenkalais claim that<br />  vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only after Ramanuja, but<br />  only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in the Guruparampara.<br />  The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated from Pillai<br />  Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br /> <br />  This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the<br />  other&#39;s views. Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters into a<br />  philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup<br />  regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on that<br />  debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it is<br />  subject to a debate.<br /> <br />  Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. He<br />  attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines<br />  which all the historians accept unopposed.<br /> <br />  Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the<br />  Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though<br />  within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that<br />  Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and got<br />  it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was<br />  reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere &#40;may be in<br />  this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated during the times of Nayak<br />  kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.<br /> <br />  Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as<br />  Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of<br />  Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the<br />  history.<br /> <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "R.venketesh" <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Hi<br />    so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />   <br />    i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41; instruments used on ramanuja<br />    himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were discovered in a<br />    secret chamber in the last decade<br />   <br />    .     So if he still has taken such a<br />    scene<br />      like King asking Ramanuja instead of Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />      verses,<br />   <br />   <br />   <br />     <br />       <br />        This person im talking about also has the tatoo &#40;or is it<br />  burned<br />      into the<br />        skin?

Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri<br />  for<br />    his<br />          bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and<br />      informed that<br />          the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about<br />  the<br />          Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the<br />      foremost<br />          disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of<br />  the<br />          meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya<br />  and<br />      hence he<br />          silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with<br />      Periya<br />          Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the<br />  Chola<br />      King in<br />          the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples<br />  of<br />          Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked<br />    them<br />      to<br />          prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though<br />    Ramanuja<br />      did<br />          not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that<br />    Koorathazhwan<br />      has<br />          already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure<br />  by<br />      his<br />          other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of<br />  his<br />      Acharya<br />          &#40;Periya Nambi&#41; and his Sishya &#40;Koorathazhwan&#41;, left for<br />  Melkote<br />    in<br />          present day Karnataka.<br />         <br />          Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However,<br />  there<br />      was a<br />          minister by name "Naalooran" in King&#39;s court, who was once<br />      supposed to<br />          have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified<br />    him<br />          &#40;traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery<br />    to<br />      utmost<br />          concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to<br />  be<br />          deciphered&#41; as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained<br />      Koorathazhwan to<br />          write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The<br />      wording that<br />          Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam<br />    nAsthi".<br />          Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course<br />    Koorathazhwan<br />      did<br />          write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha<br />      param".<br />          Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than &#39;sivam". In older<br />  days<br />      the<br />          words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam<br />    was<br />      larger<br />          in measurement than sivam.<br />         <br />          On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked<br />    the<br />      eyes<br />          of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi.<br />      However<br />          Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my<br />  eyes.<br />    I<br />      will<br />          do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and<br />      plucks it<br />          himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.<br />         <br />          This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-<br />  up<br />    in<br />      the<br />          screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true.<br />    However<br />      we<br />          cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for<br />      ourselves.<br />         <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh<br />         <br />          --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->     40yahoogroups.com ,<br />          "Humble Groups"<br />           wrote: <br />           <br />            I just saw Kalaignar&#39;s note about the first scene.

			<div class="content">I remember reading a story on this, don't know where,<br />possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.<br /><br />A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants to<br />take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />they are in in defence of the argument. The shaivite<br />does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally there<br />is no house left.<br /><br />This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya kirtan<br />rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />ways devotees seek you, you are that.<br /><br />--- Rahul dhinakaran <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Mr.Venketesh &#40;vinjamoor_venketesh, this is getting<br />  crazy <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /> &#41;<br />  You writings are very informative. Have you written<br />  in this group before? If<br />  so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do keep<br />  this going.<br />  If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />  seeing this topic the<br />  Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming &#40;no<br />  offence, just a joke&#41;.<br />  This happens when my father and my family friend<br />  &#40;the one i was talking<br />  about earlier&#41; start having a chat about thier visit<br />  to the meenakshi<br />  temple. This family friend &#40;im delibrately<br />  refraining from naming him&#41;<br />  doesn&#39;t go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father, being<br />  a Saivite &#40;not fanatic,<br />  we visit Srirangam too&#41;, starts the arguement and it<br />  keeps continuing.<br />  For an arguement and topic which has been going on<br />  for more than 10<br />  centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.<br /> <br />  I just wanted to convey this, this is also a pretty<br />  sensitive topic hence i<br />  request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />  refrain from hurting<br />  another&#39;s feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />  openess of society we seem<br />  to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />  hand is required so i<br />  request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />  threads and mercilessy<br />  delete any mails which might seem offensive.<br /> <br />  Regards<br />  Rahul<br /> <br />  On 5/3/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Mr Venketesh<br />   <br />    The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial<br />  debate going on<br />    between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />  thenkalais claim that<br />    vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />  after Ramanuja, but<br />    only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />  the Guruparampara.<br />    The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />  from Pillai<br />    Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br />   <br />    This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />  to accept the<br />    other&#39;s views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />  if one enters into a<br />    philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />  small writeup<br />    regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />  personal mails on that<br />    debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />  here. Ofcourse, it is<br />    subject to a debate.<br />   <br />    Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />  for 120 years. He<br />    attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />  are the timelines<br />    which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />   <br />    Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />  link to the<br />    Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />  happened later, though<br />    within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />  saying that<br />    Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />  from the sea and got<br />    it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />  sure, how he was<br />    reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />  somewhere &#40;may be in<br />    this group itself&#41; that He was reinstated during<br />  the times of Nayak<br />    kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />  Chitrakoodam.<br />   <br />    Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />  neither acting as<br />    Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />  of the Temple of<br />    Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />  mention in the<br />    history.<br />   <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />   <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  ,<br />    "R.venketesh" <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      Hi<br />      so many venkatesh&#39;s in the group now.<br />     <br />      i have seen the tatooing&#40; or branding&#41;<br />  instruments used on ramanuja<br />      himself&#40;???&#41; in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />  discovered in a<br />      secret chamber in the last decade<br />     <br />      .     So if he still has taken such a<br />      scene<br />        like King asking Ramanuja instead of<br />  Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />        verses,<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />       <br />         <br />          This person im talking about also has the<br />  tatoo &#40;or is it<br />    burned<br />        into the<br />          skin? Can somebody confirm this?&#41; on his<br />  bicep.<br />     <br />     <br />      rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam&#40;<br />  straight lined like a<br />      trident rather than the U of vadakalai&#41;<br />     <br />      but one doubt??<br />      didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then<br />  how does he do<br />    this<br />      say some 50 years prior?<br />     <br />     <br />      can sps clarify the timelines of<br />     <br />      a. ramanuja<br />      b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and<br />  the sea dropping.<br />     <br />      isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja<br />  recovered it and placed<br />      it in kizh tirupathi?????<br />     <br />      venketesh<br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />     <br />      They are not<br />        allowed to have<br />          a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in<br />  that particular<br />      scene.<br />          I think its pretty hard to stick with the<br />  legend in the movie.<br />        Maybe Kamal<br />          just took the cusp and formed a creative<br />  story based on that.<br />    The<br />        movie<br />          should clear this up.<br />         <br />          Regards<br />          Rahul<br />         <br />          On 5/3/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />   wrote: <br />           <br />            Well, that was a really confusing<br />  statement from MK.<br />    Actually<br />        according<br />            to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which<br />  talks about the<br />      stories<br />        of<br />            all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism<br />  starting from Nathamuni<br />    until<br />            Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was<br />  asked by the Chola<br />        King to<br />            recite Siva&#39;s name as supreme.<br />           <br />            The story goes thus: &#40;As taken from the<br />  book "Guruparampara<br />        Prabhavam"&#41;<br /> <br />=== message truncated ===</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Be a better friend, newshound, and<br />know-it-all with Yahoo!
