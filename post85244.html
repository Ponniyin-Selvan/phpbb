			<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />A small write for an exciting trip I had last sunday.<br /><br />A walk back in Time:<br /><br />"A Road less Traveled", I experienced the meaning of the phrase last Sunday.<br />I was told by Venkat Sir, that Chandra was planning for a one day heritage<br />trip. When I spoke to Chandra he told that it was historic cavemen site. At<br />that time I wasn't thrilled to go to such a place, but I agreed to go.<br /><br />We started some what late by 7.30 from Sathyamurthy Sir's residence. The<br />place we have planned is near thiruvallur. The road was so bad that we<br />traveled about 2 1/2 hours to travel a distance of about 50 KM. Chandra had<br />brought breakfast and lunch for us, we finished the breakfast in the middle<br />of our journey. I had a nice talk with Mr Chandra<br />about his experiences with Temple cleaning and other idea's of his. Chandra<br />is full of ideas and energy, am really<br />wondering from where he is getting all the energy for the small frame he<br />has.<br /><br />Our group had Mr. Thirumurthy apart from Dr Sathymurthuy from <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> to guide<br />us. Mr. Thirumurthy who was familiar with the place was leading the way. The<br />place we were going is called Gudiyam and we had to stop to van before 5 KM.<br /><br /><br />Initially we underestimated the distance to walk, and took only water as we<br />thought we might return for lunch to van. We all started a brisk walk to the<br />site with Dr Sathyamuthy and Thirumurthy leading the walk. The two were<br />explaining to all of about the site. The place was an industry to build the<br />stone age tools like hand axe, scrapper, blades (actual words from the tools<br />picked from our guides). They picked up the tools and handed each one of us<br />a sample. They explained how a rock is cut from its base to make a tool.<br />After a long explanation of this nature, all of started seeing the rocks<br />with different eye. Each rock looked to have a shape for us, and we really<br />went back in time and see the rocks from the eye of our ancestors. While<br />walking we saw a huge black rock what is called as Conglomerate.<br />Conglomerate is hardened lava which had lot stone tools embedded in it.<br /><br />Check the photos at the following link:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.imagestation.com/album/pictures.html?id=2097669759">http://www.imagestation.com/album/pictu ... 2097669759</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The walk from the start to the first cave was about 5 KM. The cave was huge,<br />around 100 meters wide and 50 Meters taller. According to Sathyamurthy Sir,<br />the cave would have been formed after the ice age, when the ice melted and<br />water receded from this place. He pointed out a grayish area at the top of<br />the cave, which is the mark up to which water would have been there. While<br />going towards this place, we took a native woman working there to help us<br />locate the caves. She told there is pond about cave. When we went to the top<br />the cave, the view absolutely stunning. Only then we realized we were in<br />middle of a dense forest, and the view we saw will be imprinted in our minds<br />forever.<br /><br />At the top of the cave Sathyamurthy Sir pointed out a fossil. It was an<br />impression of a snail or something similar to it allover it when the rock<br />was in a semisolid state (Check the photo's section to see this interesting<br />peace). We found another rock with the similar imprint. We realized the<br />steepness of the path we came only while going getting down. We went to next<br />cave guided by the native woman. This cave has a small Amman temple in it.<br />This one was much bigger than the previous one and there was lot of big<br />honeycombs at the edges of the cave and also in the neighboring<br />mountains(just like the one's in Big Temple).I had an interesting discussion<br />about the books (<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, Sherlock Holmes) with Mr. Natarajan while walking to<br />the 2nd cave.<br /><br />By this time, every body has become really tired and only then we realized<br />that we have not brought anything to eat except water. So we have decided to<br />return to the van cutting short the visits to the other caves. It was said<br />there are around 9 such caves available in that area. The walk back was the<br />one that I will never forget in my life. We split in to 2 groups with Madan,<br />Chandra, Thirumurthy and Parasuram going ahead of us, while myself,<br />Sathymurthy sir, Natarajan, Gomathi and Sundaram walked behind. Sathymurthy<br />Sir was talking about his archeological experiences in recent years. It was<br />fascinating to hear his experiences. He also explained me about the general<br />evolution theory so as to easily correlate it with what we saw at the cave.<br />I really walked back in time during this time. It was amazing how a 65 year<br />old man could walk 10 KM talking non stop enthusiastically.<br /><br />We had a hearty meal which was just curd rice, but it really felt delicious<br />at that time. It took about 4 hours to come back to the van. The people at<br />the place was very happy to see us, they gave us water (good they away from<br />Chennai). I went over the moon when I saw the phone they are using in that<br />area is actually a done by my company (Midas Comm.). For some time I rambled<br />to Mr. Sundaram about the product and its use in rural places like this.<br /><br />We then visited the Archeology museum at Poondi. The museum was a small one,<br />but filled with interesting articles. The time period of the some of stone<br />tools at the museum was dated around 5 lac years. It was mind bobbling even<br />to think about it. The most interesting piece available at the museum was a<br />fossil of a snail of the size of Maruthi van tyre. That fossil was dated<br />some 80 lac years. We could not take photos of the piece as it is<br />restricted.<br /><br />Atlast we went to the completely full Poondi reservoir, coming back to<br />future. We started there around 5.45 and reached Chennai through another<br />route through Thiruvallur, Ponnamalle High Road. We reached Sathymurthy<br />Sir's residence by 7.15.<br />All in all, it was an amazing and unforgettable trip for me.<br /><br /><br />--<br />with luv & regards,<br />siva<br /><br />My Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com</div>

The walk back was the<br />  one that I will never forget in my life. We split in to 2 groups with Madan,<br />  Chandra, Thirumurthy and Parasuram going ahead of us, while myself,<br />  Sathymurthy sir, Natarajan, Gomathi and Sundaram walked behind. Sathymurthy<br />  Sir was talking about his archeological experiences in recent years. It was<br />  fascinating to hear his experiences. He also explained me about the general<br />  evolution theory so as to easily correlate it with what we saw at the cave.<br />  I really walked back in time during this time. It was amazing how a 65 year<br />  old man could walk 10 KM talking non stop enthusiastically.<br /> <br />  We had a hearty meal which was just curd rice, but it really felt<br />  delicious at that time. It took about 4 hours to come back to the van. The<br />  people at the place was very happy to see us, they gave us water &#40;good they<br />  away from Chennai&#41;. I went over the moon when I saw the phone they are using<br />  in that area is actually a done by my company &#40;Midas Comm.&#41;. For some time I<br />  rambled to Mr. Sundaram about the product and its use in rural places like<br />  this.<br /> <br />  We then visited the Archeology museum at Poondi. The museum was a small<br />  one, but filled with interesting articles. The time period of the some of<br />  stone tools at the museum was dated around 5 lac years. It was mind bobbling<br />  even to think about it. The most interesting piece available at the museum<br />  was a fossil of a snail of the size of Maruthi van tyre. That fossil was<br />  dated some 80 lac years. We could not take photos of the piece as it is<br />  restricted.<br /> <br />  Atlast we went to the completely full Poondi reservoir, coming back to<br />  future. We started there around 5.45 and reached Chennai through another<br />  route through Thiruvallur, Ponnamalle High Road. We reached Sathymurthy<br />  Sir&#39;s residence by 7.15.<br />  All in all, it was an amazing and unforgettable trip for me.<br /> <br /> <br />  --<br />  with luv & regards,<br />  siva<br /> <br />  My Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com</div></blockquote></div>

It was an<br />  impression of a snail or something similar to it<br />  allover it when the rock<br />  was in a semisolid state &#40;Check the photo&#39;s section<br />  to see this interesting<br />  peace&#41;. We found another rock with the similar<br />  imprint. We realized the<br />  steepness of the path we came only while going<br />  getting down. We went to next<br />  cave guided by the native woman. This cave has a<br />  small Amman temple in it.<br />  This one was much bigger than the previous one and<br />  there was lot of big<br />  honeycombs at the edges of the cave and also in the<br />  neighboring<br />  mountains&#40;just like the one&#39;s in Big Temple&#41;.I had<br />  an interesting discussion<br />  about the books &#40;<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, Sherlock Holmes&#41; with Mr.<br />  Natarajan while walking to<br />  the 2nd cave.<br /> <br />  By this time, every body has become really tired and<br />  only then we realized<br />  that we have not brought anything to eat except<br />  water. So we have decided to<br />  return to the van cutting short the visits to the<br />  other caves. It was said<br />  there are around 9 such caves available in that<br />  area. The walk back was the<br />  one that I will never forget in my life. We split in<br />  to 2 groups with Madan,<br />  Chandra, Thirumurthy and Parasuram going ahead of<br />  us, while myself,<br />  Sathymurthy sir, Natarajan, Gomathi and Sundaram<br />  walked behind. Sathymurthy<br />  Sir was talking about his archeological experiences<br />  in recent years. It was<br />  fascinating to hear his experiences. He also<br />  explained me about the general<br />  evolution theory so as to easily correlate it with<br />  what we saw at the cave.<br />  I really walked back in time during this time. It<br />  was amazing how a 65 year<br />  old man could walk 10 KM talking non stop<br />  enthusiastically.<br /> <br />  We had a hearty meal which was just curd rice, but<br />  it really felt delicious<br />  at that time. It took about 4 hours to come back to<br />  the van. The people at<br />  the place was very happy to see us, they gave us<br />  water &#40;good they away from<br />  Chennai&#41;. I went over the moon when I saw the phone<br />  they are using in that<br />  area is actually a done by my company &#40;Midas Comm.&#41;.<br />  For some time I rambled<br />  to Mr. Sundaram about the product and its use in<br />  rural places like this.<br /> <br />  We then visited the Archeology museum at Poondi. The<br />  museum was a small one,<br />  but filled with interesting articles. The time<br />  period of the some of stone<br />  tools at the museum was dated around 5 lac years. It<br />  was mind bobbling even<br />  to think about it. The most interesting piece<br />  available at the museum was a<br />  fossil of a snail of the size of Maruthi van tyre.<br />  That fossil was dated<br />  some 80 lac years. We could not take photos of the<br />  piece as it is<br />  restricted.<br /> <br />  Atlast we went to the completely full Poondi<br />  reservoir, coming back to<br />  future. We started there around 5.45 and reached<br />  Chennai through another<br />  route through Thiruvallur, Ponnamalle High Road. We<br />  reached Sathymurthy<br />  Sir&#39;s residence by 7.15.<br />  All in all, it was an amazing and unforgettable trip<br />  for me.<br /> <br /> <br />  --<br />  with luv & regards,<br />  siva<br /> <br />  My Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com</div></blockquote><br />__________________________________________________<br />Do You Yahoo!?<br />Tired of spam?

When I spoke to Chandra he told that it was historic cavemen <br />site. At<br />  that time I wasn&#39;t thrilled to go to such a place, but I agreed to <br />go.<br />  <br />  We started some what late by 7.30 from Sathyamurthy Sir&#39;s <br />residence. The<br />  place we have planned is near thiruvallur. The road was so bad that <br />we<br />  traveled about 2 1/2 hours to travel a distance of about 50 KM. <br />Chandra had<br />  brought breakfast and lunch for us, we finished the breakfast in <br />the middle<br />  of our journey. I had a nice talk with Mr Chandra<br />  about his experiences with Temple cleaning and other idea&#39;s of his. <br />Chandra<br />  is full of ideas and energy, am really<br />  wondering from where he is getting all the energy for the small <br />frame he<br />  has.<br />  <br />  Our group had Mr. Thirumurthy apart from Dr Sathymurthuy from <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> <br />to guide<br />  us. Mr. Thirumurthy who was familiar with the place was leading the <br />way. The<br />  place we were going is called Gudiyam and we had to stop to van <br />before 5 KM.<br />  <br />  <br />  Initially we underestimated the distance to walk, and took only <br />water as we<br />  thought we might return for lunch to van. We all started a brisk <br />walk to the<br />  site with Dr Sathyamuthy and Thirumurthy leading the walk. The two <br />were<br />  explaining to all of about the site. The place was an industry to <br />build the<br />  stone age tools like hand axe, scrapper, blades &#40;actual words from <br />the tools<br />  picked from our guides&#41;. They picked up the tools and handed each <br />one of us<br />  a sample. They explained how a rock is cut from its base to make a <br />tool.<br />  After a long explanation of this nature, all of started seeing the <br />rocks<br />  with different eye. Each rock looked to have a shape for us, and we <br />really<br />  went back in time and see the rocks from the eye of our ancestors. <br />While<br />  walking we saw a huge black rock what is called as Conglomerate.<br />  Conglomerate is hardened lava which had lot stone tools embedded in <br />it.<br />  <br />  Check the photos at the following link:<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.imagestation.com/album/pictures.html?id=2097669759">http://www.imagestation.com/album/pictu ... 2097669759</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />  The walk from the start to the first cave was about 5 KM. The cave <br />was huge,<br />  around 100 meters wide and 50 Meters taller. According to <br />Sathyamurthy Sir,<br />  the cave would have been formed after the ice age, when the ice <br />melted and<br />  water receded from this place. He pointed out a grayish area at the <br />top of<br />  the cave, which is the mark up to which water would have been <br />there. While<br />  going towards this place, we took a native woman working there to <br />help us<br />  locate the caves. She told there is pond about cave.

When I spoke to Chandra he told that it was<br />    historic cavemen site. At<br />    that time I wasn&#39;t thrilled to go to such a place,<br />    but I agreed to go.<br />   <br />    We started some what late by 7.30 from Sathyamurthy<br />    Sir&#39;s residence. The<br />    place we have planned is near thiruvallur. The road<br />    was so bad that we<br />    traveled about 2 1/2 hours to travel a distance of<br />    about 50 KM. Chandra had<br />    brought breakfast and lunch for us, we finished the<br />    breakfast in the middle<br />    of our journey. I had a nice talk with Mr Chandra<br />    about his experiences with Temple cleaning and other<br />    idea&#39;s of his. Chandra<br />    is full of ideas and energy, am really<br />    wondering from where he is getting all the energy<br />    for the small frame he<br />    has.<br />   <br />    Our group had Mr. Thirumurthy apart from Dr<br />    Sathymurthuy from <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">ASI</acronym> to guide<br />    us. Mr. Thirumurthy who was familiar with the place<br />    was leading the way. The<br />    place we were going is called Gudiyam and we had to<br />    stop to van before 5 KM.<br />   <br />   <br />    Initially we underestimated the distance to walk,<br />    and took only water as we<br />    thought we might return for lunch to van. We all<br />    started a brisk walk to the<br />    site with Dr Sathyamuthy and Thirumurthy leading the<br />    walk. The two were<br />    explaining to all of about the site. The place was<br />    an industry to build the<br />    stone age tools like hand axe, scrapper, blades<br />    &#40;actual words from the tools<br />    picked from our guides&#41;. They picked up the tools<br />    and handed each one of us<br />    a sample. They explained how a rock is cut from its<br />    base to make a tool.<br />    After a long explanation of this nature, all of<br />    started seeing the rocks<br />    with different eye. Each rock looked to have a shape<br />    for us, and we really<br />    went back in time and see the rocks from the eye of<br />    our ancestors. While<br />    walking we saw a huge black rock what is called as<br />    Conglomerate.<br />    Conglomerate is hardened lava which had lot stone<br />    tools embedded in it.<br />   <br />    Check the photos at the following link:<br />   <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.imagestation.com/album/pictures.html?id=2097669759">http://www.imagestation.com/album/pictu ... 2097669759</a><!-- m --><br />   <br />    The walk from the start to the first cave was about<br />    5 KM. The cave was huge,<br />    around 100 meters wide and 50 Meters taller.<br />    According to Sathyamurthy Sir,<br />    the cave would have been formed after the ice age,<br />    when the ice melted and<br />    water receded from this place. He pointed out a<br />    grayish area at the top of<br />    the cave, which is the mark up to which water would<br />    have been there. While<br />    going towards this place, we took a native woman<br />    working there to help us<br />    locate the caves. She told there is pond about cave.<br />    When we went to the top<br />    the cave, the view absolutely stunning. Only then we<br />    realized we were in<br />    middle of a dense forest, and the view we saw will<br />    be imprinted in our minds<br />    forever.<br />   <br />    At the top of the cave Sathyamurthy Sir pointed out<br />    a fossil. It was an<br />    impression of a snail or something similar to it<br />    allover it when the rock<br />    was in a semisolid state &#40;Check the photo&#39;s section<br />    to see this interesting<br />    peace&#41;. We found another rock with the similar<br />    imprint. We realized the<br />    steepness of the path we came only while going<br />    getting down. We went to next<br />    cave guided by the native woman. This cave has a<br />    small Amman temple in it.<br />    This one was much bigger than the previous one and<br />    there was lot of big<br />    honeycombs at the edges of the cave and also in the<br />    neighboring<br />    mountains&#40;just like the one&#39;s in Big Temple&#41;.I had<br />    an interesting discussion<br />    about the books &#40;<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>, Sherlock Holmes&#41; with Mr.<br />    Natarajan while walking to<br />    the 2nd cave.<br />   <br />    By this time, every body has become really tired and<br />    only then we realized<br />    that we have not brought anything to eat except<br />    water. So we have decided to<br />    return to the van cutting short the visits to the<br />    other caves. It was said<br />    there are around 9 such caves available in that<br />    area. The walk back was the<br />    one that I will never forget in my life. We split in<br />    to 2 groups with Madan,<br />    Chandra, Thirumurthy and Parasuram going ahead of<br />    us, while myself,<br />    Sathymurthy sir, Natarajan, Gomathi and Sundaram<br />    walked behind. Sathymurthy<br />    Sir was talking about his archeological experiences<br />    in recent years. It was<br />    fascinating to hear his experiences. He also<br />    explained me about the general<br />    evolution theory so as to easily correlate it with<br />    what we saw at the cave.<br />    I really walked back in time during this time. It<br />    was amazing how a 65 year<br />    old man could walk 10 KM talking non stop<br />    enthusiastically.<br />   <br />    We had a hearty meal which was just curd rice, but<br />    it really felt delicious<br />    at that time. It took about 4 hours to come back to<br />    the van. The people at<br />    the place was very happy to see us, they gave us<br />    water &#40;good they away from<br />    Chennai&#41;. I went over the moon when I saw the phone<br />    they are using in that<br />    area is actually a done by my company &#40;Midas Comm.&#41;.<br />    For some time I rambled<br />    to Mr. Sundaram about the product and its use in<br />    rural places like this.<br />   <br />    We then visited the Archeology museum at Poondi. The<br />    museum was a small one,<br />    but filled with interesting articles. The time<br />    period of the some of stone<br />    tools at the museum was dated around 5 lac years. It<br />    was mind bobbling even<br />    to think about it. The most interesting piece<br />    available at the museum was a<br />    fossil of a snail of the size of Maruthi van tyre.<br />    That fossil was dated<br />    some 80 lac years. We could not take photos of the<br />    piece as it is<br />    restricted.<br />   <br />    Atlast we went to the completely full Poondi<br />    reservoir, coming back to<br />    future. We started there around 5.45 and reached<br />    Chennai through another<br />    route through Thiruvallur, Ponnamalle High Road. We<br />    reached Sathymurthy<br />    Sir&#39;s residence by 7.15.<br />    All in all, it was an amazing and unforgettable trip<br />    for me.<br />   <br />   <br />    --<br />    with luv & regards,<br />    siva<br />   <br />    My Blog: sivaramsk.blogspot.com<br />   <br /> <br />  __________________________________________________<br />  Do You Yahoo!?<br />  Tired of spam?
