			<div class="content">I think there is no debate at all if you agree that everyone contributed intheir own way (including ARR) as many others said!! You said quite clearlyyou thought IR had 'legend' status while others are 'just greats' and thatis the point I dispute.<br />Â <br />Yeah one tune seems similar and he used the same raaga...talk of rehashing..of course he had to meet deadlines, producer enna paithyima, he is paying out of his nose <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) I mean it is a known fact against IR admitted himself that he was overcommitted and could not deliver the quality he wanted. He even went as far as saying he wished he never came to movies, in a kumudam interview. <br /><br />Everyone used raagas, most people made it as a rags to riches story. One ofthe reasons why classical music detiorated so much is due to athiest movement and many classical music singers/directors happened to be brahmins. In fact the common man's image of a classical music singer itslef is a kudumi mama. During its worst times you could not even watch movies with lot of songs in a theatre. IR arrived at this time. He had immense talent to go withit and he made it.

But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted "Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet.

"Oh Vasantha Raja"Â from "Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu"Â from the movie "Indru Nee Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movieÂ "Poonthota Kavalkaran"are all based on one raga can you say they sound similar!

			<div class="content">Malathi,<br /><br />I am Sorry madam.I just quoted what you said in the previous mail. You had<br />written IR knows some classical music. Which is wrong statement and more<br />over its a strong statement. He has very sound knowledge, so much that<br />Critic Subbudu had lot of respect for him and has appriciated him. That's<br />what I said as "Vasihtar Vaayala Bramma Rishi Pattam". I know, now you will<br />say even Subbudu is partial / also one sided / kakka pudikkaravar!<br />Correct-a? If that's is the case, then we will stop arguing this point (IR<br />is well versed in Classical Music) here itself. I need a black and white<br />answer from your end in the next mail. Not a grey answer neither here not<br />there.<br /><br />Coming to the number of songs IR has in his kitty. When you talk to people<br />who call themselves as IR fans ask them their favorite. I am sure they will<br />say "Poo Malaye Thol Serava" / Udaya Geetham Songs / Or if you insist on<br />even earlier songs they may come to Jonny. But let me tell you when you look<br />at his career from Annakili to Moodupani (His 100th movie) he has tried /<br />experimented many ragas during this period. I will say post 85 were all hit<br />all his experiments were 76 - 85.<br /><br />Coming to the Tier-1 / Tier-2 concept I do agree that MSV / KVM are all<br />there in Tier-1. But I do have a ranking there in that Tier. I didn't reveal<br />that. Do I need to say who is 1st rank in that Tier-1? Again we may start<br />discussing why 1st Rank to IR and why not MSV / KVM.<br /><br />Thats what I said in my previous mail - All of them have the same set of<br />Ragas. But why didn't it strike MSV and KVM to do the experiments which IR<br />did? Applying the same concept again and again is a ordinary thing. Being<br />curious about new things and ideas, trying them out in film music by<br />applying his imagination. This is just like a scientist. All others greats<br />of previous generations are good teachers, not a scientist. But this man is<br />a good scientist. So I give this extra credit to this man and I place him up<br />on the top. Above all the greats of yester years.<br /><br />Remember Kamal once said about IR, you should not call him "Isai Gnani"<br />rather you should call him "Isai Vignani" Now you may question Kamal's<br />knowledge in music. Kamal once broke his leg and was out of film shooting<br />for some time. He utilised that to start his music classes and his teacher<br />was Dr.Balamuralikrishna.<br /><br />Again coming back to Ragas handled by other greats show me one in Kanakangi<br />- First Ragam in Melakarta. IR has composed "Mohan Yennum" song in Sindhu<br />Bhairavi.<br /><br />Debate will continue!

All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them!<br />  This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they<br />  cant play even after that then they are not musicians.<br /> <br />  If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music<br />  and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. <acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym> -<br />  Tiruvasagam Symphony, had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As<br />  usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments.<br />  He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer<br />  room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the<br />  music which was being played down by the musicians didn&#39;t tally with the<br />  notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to<br />  visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300<br />  musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!<br /> <br />  <br />  Using classical ragas is common with every music director since the dawn of<br />  time<br />  <br /> <br />  Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song,<br />  situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in<br />  "Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai<br />  Yezhudum Neramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people<br />  in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the<br />  name of Sita&#39;s charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted<br />  "Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR<br />  its is not yedavadhu oru raagam ..<br /> <br />  <br />  IR&#39;s songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand<br />  and pressure<br />  <br /> <br />  In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on<br />  the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja" from<br />  "Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu" from the movie "Indru Nee<br />  Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie "Poonthota Kavalkaran" are<br />  all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!<br /> <br />  <br />  Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunna that is perfectly fine<br />  <br /> <br />  I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV&#39;s<br />  songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid<br />  / Laxman. They are all good batsman no doubt and I agree. But the pleasure<br />  in watching Vishy is simply missing in others. People who have watched Vishy<br />  play will agree to what I say.<br /> <br />  ~ Udanx<br />  --<br />  "Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />  difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />  -- Benjamin Franklin</div></blockquote><br /><br />--<br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Vijay,<br />Would you agree with me that stone sculpture<br />{and also bronzes} deteriorated in quality after<br />the 11th century? When I walked by the Shilpa<br />stalls in Mallai a couple of winters ago, I was<br />unhappy to see how stiff, wooden, uninspired<br />the murthis were. Where has the 'prana' gone?<br />I know they have to follow strict rules of proportion<br />and gesture, but still. . .<br />Do you agree?<br />I do admire some of the later Gopuram murthis, though.<br />They still have lots of inner energy.<br />Kathie</div>
