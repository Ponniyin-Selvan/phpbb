Any project here <br />takes 2<br />  years to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. <br />It&#39;s a<br />  rule.<br />  <br />  Globalize processes have caused in us &#40;all over the world&#41; a <br />general sense<br />  of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to <br />posses a need<br />  to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow <br />movements of<br />  the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x<br />  quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, <br />this<br />  always yields better results.<br />  <br />  Said in another words:<br />  1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br />  2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />  3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />  4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its <br />renowned<br />  companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.<br />  <br />  The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up <br />at the<br />  hotel every morning. It was September, <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> cold and snowy. We would <br />arrive<br />  early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance <br />&#40;2000<br />  employees drive their car to work&#41;. The first day, I didn&#39;t say <br />anything,<br />  either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a <br />fixed<br />  parking space? I&#39;ve noticed we park far from the entrance even when <br />there<br />  are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we&#39;re <br />here early<br />  we&#39;ll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and <br />need a<br />  place closer to the door. Don&#39;t you think? Imagine my face.<br />  <br />  Nowadays, there&#39;s a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This <br />movement<br />  establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough <br />time to<br />  taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without <br />rushing. Slow<br />  Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what <br />it stands<br />  for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement <br />called Slow<br />  Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.<br />  <br />  Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and <br />"craziness"<br />  generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in <br />quantity"<br />  &#40;life status&#41; versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the <br />"quality<br />  of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, <br />are more<br />  productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 <br />hour<br />  workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. <br />This slow<br />  attitude has brought forth the US&#39;s attention, pupils of the fast <br />and the<br />  "do it now!".<br />  <br />  This no-rush attitude doesn&#39;t represent doing less or having a <br />lower<br />  productivity. It means working and doing things with greater <br />quality,<br />  productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. <br />It means<br />  reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. <br />Taking the<br />  "now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and <br />anonymous.<br />  It means taking humans&#39; essential values, the simplicity of living.<br />  <br />  It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, <br />lighter and<br />  more productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to <br />do. It&#39;s<br />  time to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious <br />quality with<br />  no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products <br />and<br />  services, without losing the essence of spirit.<br />  <br />  In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there&#39;s a scene where Al Pacino <br />asks a<br />  girl to dance and she replies, "I can&#39;t, my boyfriend will be here <br />any<br />  minute now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". <br />Then<br />  they dance to a tango.<br />  <br />  Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach <br />it when<br />  we die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on <br />time. Others<br />  are so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the <br />present,<br />  which is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time <br />throughout<br />  the world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each <br />one of<br />  us does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon <br />said,<br />  "Life is what happens to you while you&#39;re busy making other plans".<br />  Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There <br />are many<br />  who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this<br />  globalized world.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Good view Venkatesh. I got that forward more than a week back and I <br />too feel that we need to slow up a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym>. But on further thoughts this <br />fast paced life is only in the cities. Outside cities the life is <br />still slow. <br /><br />As you said, if govt gives 2rs rice and free TV, free Gas etc. who <br />will work. Right from colonialism till date, the rulers always wanted <br />to keep the praja lazy and dump. yosikka arambicha vote poda <br />matangale...<br /><br />But on other hand there is a serious problem of unemployment. People <br />tell they dont get job. The problem is that we Indians think, if we <br />can read and write, we should get IT job, 6 digit salary at the first <br />month and without doing work should get promoted (ayyooo....nethu than <br />enga team appraisal mudichen athoda impact kandukatheenga...)<br /><br />People never think of what they are capable of and what they should <br />get. Talking about people who complaint that they dont get job <br />easily...I always feel 'muyarchi udayar igazhchi adayar'.<br /><br />A recent incident really shook me off and I felt really proud for this <br />guy whom I met. A month back, I happened to stay back in office with <br />my team late night for some urgent work (as usual in any IT company). <br />We thuoght we can leave in next half an hour and so skipped our <br />dinner, but till 2 in the morning we couldnt retire. By 3am we all <br />felt a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> (??) hungry and thought lets check out for anything outside.<br />(i am in Elnet, near Tidel and except for these two buildings there is <br />not establishment near by. manushan saga vendiyathuthan.concrete jail)<br /><br />To our surprise we could find a fellow, on his M80 fully loaded with <br />snacks, tea and all possible stuff and doing great business. We got <br />something to fill at that hour and when enquired he said he generally <br />comes ther by 6pm and retires by 2am, but today just prolonged <br />sometime (lucky me!!). He also said, they are totally 3 of them and <br />comes in three differnt timings. He does good business with people in <br />Tidel and Elnet and leads his life. A new business model which he <br />could innovate. I praised him a lot in my heart and prayed for his <br />well being. <br /><br />I feel if someone wants to survivie decently, they can. Only that we <br />lack that instinct. Unless the attitude of blaming others for our <br />mistakes changes in Indian hearts, slow or fast, we will remain the <br />same.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "R.venketesh"  <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>under employment like its predecessor is the major indian problem<br />  <br />  there is a severe labour shortage in towns like tirupur and erode <br />  which churn out our exports.<br />  <br />  the industrialists there feel if a population gets rice for 2 rupees <br />  and and a free t.v its bound to get lazy.<br />  we have already half way thro a process of creating a slow and lazy <br />  society<br />  the system has already slowed down in many parts of our country.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Mr.Venketesh's views are totally accurate. Ive just experienced this first<br />hand. My vendors in Coimbatore are facing severe labour shortage. They are<br />unable to find machinists, etc. Thier labourers are shunning these skilled<br />(but tough) jobs for lesser skilled jobs like painting/whitewashing<br />homes,offices,etc. The pay is more or less the same and they have to work<br />only 4 hours a day (8 hour day reduces to 4 hour because of<br />coffee/lunch/smoking breaks) when compared to the machinist's work where<br />they have to work 8-10hrs a day. The machine shop owners are taking up<br />unskilled labourers from Madurai,Namakkal and training them as machinists!<br />Every machine shop owner is of the opinion that skilled labour would be very<br />very scarce in the next 3-5 years.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br />On 2/16/07, R.venketesh  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>under employment like its predecessor is the major indian problem<br /> <br />  there is a severe labour shortage in towns like tirupur and erode<br />  which churn out our exports.<br /> <br />  the industrialists there feel if a population gets rice for 2 rupees<br />  and and a free t.v its bound to get lazy.<br />  we have already half way thro a process of creating a slow and lazy<br />  society<br />  the system has already slowed down in many parts of our country.<br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "Muruganantham" <br /> <br />  wrote:<br />   <br />    Siva,<br />   <br />    Inga ippavae avanavan thoongi vazhiyaraan.

Working <br />for them<br />  has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here takes <br />2 years<br />  to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. It&#39;s a <br />rule.<br />  <br />  Globalize processes have caused in us &#40;all over the world&#41; a <br />general sense<br />  of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to <br />posses a need<br />  to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow <br />movements of<br />  the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x<br />  quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, <br />this<br />  always yields better results.<br />  <br />  Said in another words:<br />  1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br />  2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />  3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />  4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its <br />renowned<br />  companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.<br />  <br />  The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up <br />at the<br />  hotel every morning. It was September, <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> cold and snowy. We would <br />arrive<br />  early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance <br />&#40;2000<br />  employees drive their car to work&#41;. The first day, I didn&#39;t say <br />anything,<br />  either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a <br />fixed<br />  parking space? I&#39;ve noticed we park far from the entrance even when <br />there<br />  are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we&#39;re <br />here early<br />  we&#39;ll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and <br />need a<br />  place closer to the door. Don&#39;t you think? Imagine my face.<br />  <br />  Nowadays, there&#39;s a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This movement<br />  establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough <br />time to<br />  taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without <br />rushing. Slow<br />  Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what <br />it stands<br />  for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement <br />called Slow<br />  Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.<br />  <br />  Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and <br />"craziness"<br />  generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in <br />quantity"<br />  &#40;life status&#41; versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the <br />"quality<br />  of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, <br />are more<br />  productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 <br />hour<br />  workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. <br />This slow<br />  attitude has brought forth the US&#39;s attention, pupils of the fast <br />and the<br />  "do it now!".<br />  <br />  This no-rush attitude doesn&#39;t represent doing less or having a lower<br />  productivity. It means working and doing things with greater <br />quality,<br />  productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. <br />It means<br />  reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. <br />Taking the<br />  "now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and <br />anonymous.<br />  It means taking humans&#39; essential values, the simplicity of living.<br />  <br />  It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter <br />and more<br />  productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do. <br />It&#39;s time<br />  to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality <br />with<br />  no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products <br />and<br />  services, without losing the essence of spirit.<br />  <br />  In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there&#39;s a scene where Al Pacino <br />asks a girl<br />  to dance and she replies, "I can&#39;t, my boyfriend will be here any <br />minute<br />  now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". Then <br />they dance<br />  to a tango.<br />  <br />  Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach it <br />when we<br />  die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time. <br />Others are<br />  so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the <br />present, which<br />  is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time <br />throughout the<br />  world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each one <br />of us<br />  does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon <br />said, *"Life<br />  is what happens to you while you&#39;re busy making other plans".<br />  *Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There <br />are many<br />  who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this<br />  globalized world.</div></blockquote></div>
