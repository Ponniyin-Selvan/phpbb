			<div class="content">Smt Malathi,<br /><br />You said: <br />==================Quote========================<br />That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel things <br />happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these are <br />just some challenges with that approach.<br />==================Unquote=======================<br /><br />You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there are <br />indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. <br /><br />But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism Philosophy <br />perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief on <br />Him, is done by Him only. <br /><br />Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhaviruttham says,<br /><br />naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, aRindhanan <br />nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE<br /><br />Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable of <br />taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your thoughts) <br />to me. I know you!!! <br /><br />Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is the <br />sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.<br /><br />The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs that <br />I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE <br />kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".<br /><br />Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as the <br />Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there would <br />be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering the <br />Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.<br /><br />This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means Vishnu <br />and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the <br />above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then Siva <br />and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. <br /><br />This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,<br /><br />thAzh sadaiyum (Siva) nIL mudiyum (Vishnu) oN mazhuvum (Siva) <br />chakkaramum (Vishnu) sUzh aravum (Siva) pon nANum (Vishnu) thOndRum <br />mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw everything <br />as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way. <br /><br />Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear V Venkat, first of all thank for you raising these questions. <br />Visualising God as human or non human is essentially the Dwaita and</div></blockquote>Adwaita traditiions and how they are different. <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Â <br />  Let us face it, as young people everyone has a need to visualise <br />God as human.

If you thought I got offended, I am <br />  definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />asked <br />  you the below question is different. Well, without making you wait <br />  let me say what I wanted to say.<br />  <br />  There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />form <br />  that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am sure <br />  there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. <br />  <br />  The pAsuram goes like this &#40;I had already quoted this some time <br />back&#41;<br />  <br />  thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />  thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />  evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />  avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.<br />  <br />  Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may not <br />  know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />Him, <br />  He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls Him, <br />He <br />  accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted <br />into, <br />  He takes that form.<br />  <br />  So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising Him <br />  as a human. <br />  <br />  But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is just <br />  one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is the <br />  Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some &#40;sorry <br />to <br />  say this, but&#41; stupid human. <br />  <br />  NammAzhwAr says.....<br />  <br />  paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.<br />  <br />  Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />  this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />is <br />  called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />visvAsam <br />  is the meaning for this "paRRu".<br />  <br />  So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />  wrong in visualising Him in any form. <br />  <br />  Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />  Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />behind <br />  it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />dish.<br />  <br />  Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />  parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />says <br />  that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />  inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />  way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />  created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Sivaram Kannan" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    I apologize if I had offended someone with the statement.<br />    <br />    My sister&#39;s point was, thinking human form as the highest form of<br />    evolution, when describing the supreme being, humans made god a <br />  look<br />    alike of human form.<br />    <br />    regards,<br />    siva.<br />    <br />    On Thu, Aug 21, 2008 at 2:53 AM, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />     wrote: <br />      Dear Sivaraman,<br />     <br />      So what would that mean?

One tale is similar to the last parva of Mahabharat where yadava youths ridicule rishis for their clairvoyant powers bydressing a male as a pregnant woman and asking the gender of her unborn child. The angry rishis curse that a rod would be bornÂ that would mean the end of their dynasty.Â In the Mahabharat the rishis are Narada, Kanwa maharishi and Vishwamitra, in Jataka tale it is Vyasa.<br /><br />--- On Fri, 8/22/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  wrote: <br /><br />From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, August 22, 2008, 3:08 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yes Sathish,<br /><br />I missed your reply earlier.<br /><br />"VyAsAya vishNu rUpAya, vyAsa rUpAya vishNavE"<br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br /><br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /> wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Why, all of them survived, Arjuna, Sanjaya were alive after the <br />war.<br />  <br />  And Vyasa is considered to be vishnu amsam, so he must have had <br />gnana<br />  drishti to see what happened and documented it. or rather, since he<br />  was the one who gave out gita &#40;krishna = vishnu = vyasa&#41;, he <br />already<br />  knows gita, right.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Ravi"  wrote: <br />   <br />    Curious &#40; & ignorant&#41;... if only two heard the preaching and no <br />one <br />    survived... how did it get documented so accurately.. .<br />    <br />    are we missing something ?</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Venkat (please if you dont' mind can you drop 'Smt' makes me feel old),<br />Â <br />I understand what you say on Thenkalai philosphy and I am no expert on Vaishnavite philosphies myself. However, I disagree that the commonality in Shaivaite and Vaishnavite philosphies and also beauty of hinduism lies in 'supreme being', yes that is one perspective. There is also the perspective of Brahman which is more on the lines of Supreme Energy rather than a big boss/supreme being. Buddhism indirectly refers to the same Brahman although it does not give it a form even as a non entity.<br />Â <br />The Brahman is not a boss however benevolent we may want him to be. It is experiential energy as experienced by great saints such as Ramana, Ramakrishna and so many others. Also as expounded by JK and other non religious philosphers. The beauty of the energy is that it is experiential even with a little effort with dyana/meditation and therefore demands little effort on the part of the believer.Since that energy is part of all of us it is referedto as 'Aham Brahmasmi'.<br />Â <br />Malathi<br /><br />--- On Fri, 8/22/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  wrote: <br /><br />From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />Date: Friday, August 22, 2008, 3:02 AM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Smt Malathi,<br /><br />You said: <br />============ ======Quote= ========= ========= =====<br />That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />anything else.

A 'super human' is not that different from a human <br />authority figure to the human mind.

If you thought I got offended, I am <br />  definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />asked <br />  you the below question is different. Well, without making you wait <br />  let me say what I wanted to say.<br />  <br />  There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />form <br />  that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am sure <br />  there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. <br />  <br />  The pAsuram goes like this &#40;I had already quoted this some time <br />back&#41;<br />  <br />  thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />  thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />  evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />  avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.<br />  <br />  Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may not <br />  know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />Him, <br />  He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls Him, <br />He <br />  accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted <br />into, <br />  He takes that form.<br />  <br />  So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising Him <br />  as a human. <br />  <br />  But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is just <br />  one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is the <br />  Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some &#40;sorry <br />to <br />  say this, but&#41; stupid human. <br />  <br />  NammAzhwAr says.....<br />  <br />  paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.<br />  <br />  Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />  this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />is <br />  called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />visvAsam <br />  is the meaning for this "paRRu".<br />  <br />  So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />  wrong in visualising Him in any form. <br />  <br />  Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />  Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />behind <br />  it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />dish.<br />  <br />  Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />  parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />says <br />  that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />  inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />  way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />  created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Sivaram Kannan" <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    I apologize if I had offended someone with the statement.<br />    <br />    My sister&#39;s point was, thinking human form as the highest form of<br />    evolution, when describing the supreme being, humans made god a <br />  look<br />    alike of human form.<br />    <br />    regards,<br />    siva.<br />    <br />    On Thu, Aug 21, 2008 at 2:53 AM, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />     wrote: <br />      Dear Sivaraman,<br />     <br />      So what would that mean?

I would say, whatever you name it, if the character of <br />what you call as Brahman matches with that of the Supreme Being that <br />I said, they are all one and the same. Only that, you call it <br />as "energy" and stop there. But when I try to attach a form to it, <br />remember that a form without energy is nothing. So even my <br />visualised God is having all the energy that you stated for the <br />Brahman.<br /><br />This is where the harmony of Hinduism lies. You call the God by all <br />names and yet they all finally point out to only one. And most <br />importantly this God is full of Mercy and is Easy to Attain although <br />He is the Master.

Just that they visualised Him that way. <br />  <br />  Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"<br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />  <br />  --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, Malathi Mahadevan <br />   wrote: <br />   <br />    Dear V Venkat, first of all thank for you raising these <br />questions. <br />  Visualising God as human or non human is essentially the Dwaita <br />and <br />  Adwaita traditiions and how they are different. <br />    Â <br />    Let us face it, as young people everyone has a need to visualise <br />  God as human. It is impossible for a young and perhaps spiritually <br />  immature mind to conceptualise a God that is all pervading, spirit <br />  form without a body. We call him super human to differentiate as <br />you <br />  nicely put from a &#39;stupid human&#39;. There are some issues with this <br />  approach. A &#39;super human&#39; is not that different from a human <br />  authority figure to the human mind. Those who have had positive <br />  relationships with authority figures will be fine with this <br />approach <br />  and also with the stance that a &#39;super human&#39; can do what &#39;He&#39; <br />likes <br />  &#40;as Sri Krishna did on many occasion&#41; and I as a human just have <br />to <br />  assume it is His will. That is a great philosphy as long as I am <br />not <br />  subject to one of those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe <br />lose <br />  a child or anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn <br />to <br />  great hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has <br />cruel <br />  things happen cannot believe<br />    in a personal God many people do but these are just some <br />  challenges with that approach.<br />    Â <br />    The adwaitic spirit based God is just the all pervading spirit <br />  that is in all and of all - the spirit does not have a human <br />  personality and it is a great mystery if It has a mind or a will <br />  that works like human minds and human wills. The great part of <br />this <br />  belief system is that the spirit is experiential via <br />dyana/mediation <br />  and so much and those who have tasted that cannot possibly forget <br />  it. The spirit approach is one that makes sense to atheists who <br />  practice meditation and lot of agnostics too who are confused <br />either <br />  way.<br />    Â <br />    Just a small practical attempt to explain. There are many <br />  appraoches that mix both of these too.<br />    <br />    Â <br />    More later,<br />    Â <br />    Malathi<br />    --- On Thu, 8/21/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh  <br />  wrote: <br />    <br />    From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com<br />    Date: Thursday, August 21, 2008, 3:58 AM<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Dear Sivaraman,<br />    <br />    Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />    definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />  asked <br />    you the below question is different. Well, without making you <br />wait <br />    let me say what I wanted to say.<br />    <br />    There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />  form <br />    that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am <br />sure <br />    there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. <br />    <br />    The pAsuram goes like this &#40;I had already quoted this some time <br />  back&#41;<br />    <br />    thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />    thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />    evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />    avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.<br />    <br />    Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may <br />not <br />    know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />  Him, <br />    He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls <br />Him, <br />  He <br />    accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted <br />  into, <br />    He takes that form.<br />    <br />    So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising <br />Him <br />    as a human. <br />    <br />    But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is <br />just <br />    one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is <br />the <br />    Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some <br />&#40;sorry <br />  to <br />    say this, but&#41; stupid human. <br />    <br />    NammAzhwAr says.....<br />    <br />    paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.<br />    <br />    Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />    this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />  is <br />    called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />  visvAsam <br />    is the meaning for this "paRRu".<br />    <br />    So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely <br />nothing <br />    wrong in visualising Him in any form. <br />    <br />    Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram <br />or <br />    Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />  behind <br />    it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />  dish.<br />    <br />    Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum <br />veRRilai, <br />    parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />  says <br />    that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there <br />anything <br />    inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences <br />by <br />    way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />    created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for <br />Him.<br />    <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "Sivaram Kannan" <br />     wrote: <br />     <br />      I apologize if I had offended someone with the statement.<br />      <br />      My sister&#39;s point was, thinking human form as the highest form <br />of<br />      evolution, when describing the supreme being, humans made god <br />a <br />    look<br />      alike of human form.<br />      <br />      regards,<br />      siva.<br />      <br />      On Thu, Aug 21, 2008 at 2:53 AM, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />       wrote: <br />        Dear Sivaraman,<br />       <br />        So what would that mean?
