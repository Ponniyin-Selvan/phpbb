			<div class="content">Excellent points Sampath. Good food for thought.<br /><br />Krupa, Samptha and all,<br /><br />I too feel History cannot be purely facts. Even though we get<br />inscriptions, a percentage of hypothesis only can give full picture<br />to what we read from inscriptions. As Sampath rightly pointed out,<br />null hyposthesis though not foolproof, is the only way out to find<br />out whether our hypothesis is correct or not. If proven, correct,<br />else incorrect.<br /><br />Lets take our own debate, whether the paintings are of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> or not.<br />One group says its not while the other says it is. But either of the<br />group dont have proof. In this case, the statement of hypothesis can<br />be framed as per the groups wish and can be proved or disproved. If<br />you frame the statement you can easily disprove it and if I frame<br />the statement with the opposite meaning I can prove it. Just a<br />thought flashed in my mind. I remember seeing a similar posture of<br />the painting with a male and a couple of females standing and<br />praying as a miniature sculpture in Mappedu gopuram near Arakkonam,<br />which is supposed to be constructed by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. I dont have further<br />details or proof, we can analyse. So as of now I have two instance<br />where the persons looks similar and no fool will project the same<br />COMMON MAN/DEVOTEE in two differnt places he has built.<br /><br />Similarly, in Rams photo collection of <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram">GKC</acronym> photos I saw a sculpture<br />very much similar to the one in Panchavan madevi pallipadai, one<br />kudumi asami praying before a siva lingam. Both the temples are<br />built by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>. I think you will accept that both were built by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym><br />becuase you have FACT for them.<br /><br />If I create a null hypothesis with these evidences i have, I can<br />prove that they are indeed <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>. If you creat the null<br />hypothese you can disprove it in your own way.<br /><br />As sampath said, as long as a theory has been disproved, it will be<br />accepted as fact. And History cannot be written without hypothesis.<br />If I construct a temple, you can very well put a kalvettu there<br />saying that you built it and after 100 years, that becomes history.<br />I am just talking about possibilities. No offense meant my friend.<br /><br />You talk about evidences and facts. But I would say what you say<br />also maynot be 100% true. Another instance I can quote.<br /><br />When we were in Pullamangai, Kamal showed a pillar with tarangam and<br />said such taranga podigai with one tarangam in the opposite<br />direction means its of parantaka period. In tiruvalanchuzhi<br />kshetrabalar temple I foudn a very striking similarity between<br />pullamangai pillar and this pillar. And the kalvettu's says<br />kshetrabalar sannidhi was built by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym>. When I showed this to Kamal<br />and asked why there is a conflict, the simple answer was,"its not<br />that all such taranga podigai are of parantaka, but parantaka and<br />later". I think there is around 150 years gap between these two<br />temples and from Venkatesh I learn that in 40 years, the chola<br />architecture reached its pinnacle from mazhapadi to periya koil. If<br />in just 40 years things can change, why the taranga podigai didt<br />change for nearly 150 years.<br /><br />Can I say Kamal or the source from where Kamal got his information<br />is totally wrong? I can and I cannot, depending on how well I<br />project my hypothesis.<br /><br />What i mean to say is, its easy to mock others for their aruguement,<br />just for arguement sake. but its difficult to prove or disprove.<br />Each one can have their own school of thought, and its their<br />freedom. If we can , we should prove them otherwise else we should<br />not comment on them as long as we dont have evidences supporting our<br />arguement.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

When two persons are not in the same frame<br />of mind, one person's argument with proof may seem to other as just a<br />mockery. If one cannot understand the proof given, the proof is set<br />aside and the persons arguing would be called "mocking the other".<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I too feel History cannot be purely facts.

If proven, correct,<br />  else incorrect.</div></blockquote>I would differ from you on this point of forming a hypothesis to "get<br />a full picture." I feel it is wiser to accept the fact we cannot make<br />it out clearly when there is no evidence rather than forming a theory<br />and "creating a full picture." If one wishes to conclude something<br />based on hypothesis, it is all right and he/she can go ahead. No one<br />is going to question him/her. However, the created picture would at no<br />point show what is history. If you feel this statement is not<br />acceptable, then our definition of the term history differs. We are<br />not sailing on the same boat.<br /><br />If you feel that no fool will project the same common devotee in two<br />different places, then you have a point. There must be a meaning. But<br />based on this statement if you are going to conclude it is the picture<br />of a person who built the temple, I have nothing to say; it is a<br />possibility, not truth. If you are going to call THIS a hypothesis, go<br />ahead. This need not be disproved, as possibilities cannot be<br />disproved; rather a possibility can only be further researched.<br /><br />I dont know what made you call Kamal's answer as a simple answer, and<br />I cannot understand the reason behind the question why something did<br />not change because some other thing changed...like architecture<br />changed in 30 years but tharanga podhigai did not change even after<br />150 years.<br /><br />Also, I beg to differ from your statement that history cannot be<br />written without hypothesis.

			<div class="content">A curious question (related to the kalvettus, copper plates thread). This is <br />a thought borrowed from my friend (I have just done a Control+C and <br />Control+V).<br /><br />If the kalvettus portrayed semi-truth or a lie, why did the successors from <br />other dynasties not destroy it or write by the side that the kalvettu is not <br />(completely) true. Even in a present-day democracy, a government tries to <br />remove (or undermine) the visible victories of a previous, opposition party <br />government. A Pandya king would not have hesistated to call the bluff of a <br />Chozha's kalvettu (and vice versa).<br /><br />Does this mean the kalvettus were very close to the truth (or) that only <br />hidden kalvettus survived to see our times (or) the kings intelligently <br />inscribed on places like temple walls which no hindu king will dare to <br />touch.<br /><br />Copper plates could have easily been hidden. Hence, the doubt is regarding <br />kalvettus only.<br /><br />Siva</div>

			<div class="content">Of course no one can exclude a possibility if there is no evidence<br />against it. 100% true that such a possibility exists, I never denied<br />THE possibility. But saying it IS <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> is different from it MAY BE <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym>.<br />illayaa?<br /><br />Reg. that tharanga poadhigai concept. I dont know about it. Maybe<br />Kamal will give evidence if such a style had Parantaka's kalvettu<br />below it or any other inference to support that. But there we cannot<br />say that other kings did not build temples with the same style.<br /><br />Identifying a sculpture's period is entirely different from saying the<br />name of a person in a sculpture. It is so because at least we have one<br />conclusive evidence in the first case, whereas in the second case<br />(identifying a person in a sculpture), we dont have any evidence on<br />both the places. If we know for sure at least one person is Rajendra<br />Chozha, then we can say both of them are <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> who built the temple.<br />Again, I dont deny the possibility.<br /><br />Regarding your monalisa example, I would like to add more.<br /><br />The subject in the instance you gave is the name of the person in the<br />painting, not its period. So when it was replicated, it would be done<br />on a different canvas, or photographed. Still we can identify it as<br />Monolisa. The point here is we are able to say WHO IT IS by seeing the<br />face and smile.<br /><br />Now if you want to say all the replicated mona lisa were painted<br />during the same period by different people, the first criteria should<br />be all the canvasas should be of the same period. So seeing the type<br />of canvas, its weight, the dust in the canvas, the condition of the<br />canvas, we can safely say it is this much or that much old. Then we<br />can conclude that all the paintings were made on the same date/period.<br /><br />So identification of the person requires different parameters than<br />identifying the period of the canvas.<br /><br />The features of the sculpture would help us to say whether a sculpture<br />is of pallava's or chozha's. We cant say who is there in the sirppam<br />by seeing the features. We determine if a sculpture is a Murugan or<br />Shiva by using different parameters (like senni, virisadai, etc.), not<br />features.<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Even Dr.Kkv said that people were carried away by this hypothesis<br />  for so long that kanchi kailasanathar and mamallapuram temples were<br />  built by different person because of the dissimilarities.

The hypothesis mislead and facts helped us to identify who<br />built the temple. Why did people believe kailasanathar and<br />mamallapuram temples were built by mahendra/maamalla? Must be on the<br />hypothesis that both of them were on pallava region and mahendra and<br />narasimha were famous. Could be otherwise?

			<div class="content">Question: Why did conquering empire not destroy Kalvettu in the<br />conquered country? Does this mean the kalvettus were very close to the<br />truth or only hidden kalvettus survived to see our times<br />- There is no evidence that the conquering empire did not destroy the<br />kalvettus in a country. So Possibility 1: There is a possibility what<br />we see is the remaining kalvettus if the kings had such a practice.<br />Possibility 2: They dont have the habit of destroying the kalvettus or<br />were cunning enough to hide other's glory. We have or had all of them<br />intact in place.<br /><br />Question: the kings intelligently inscribed on places like temple<br />walls which no hindu king will dare to touch.<br /><br />- Inscribing text on temple walls was in practice even when enemy was<br />not a Saivitte/Vaishnavaitte. Therefore this excludes the possibility<br />that kalvettus were free from attack when inscribed on a temple wall.<br />Only possibility is the appropriateness of the place for the<br />particular purpose (kovil patriya seidhigal kovilgalildhaan irukkanum).<br /><br /><br />Kalvettus were very close to truth<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "Sivakumar K.N."<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>A curious question &#40;related to the kalvettus, copper plates thread&#41;.<br />This is<br />  a thought borrowed from my friend &#40;I have just done a Control+C and<br />  Control+V&#41;.<br /> <br />  If the kalvettus portrayed semi-truth or a lie, why did the<br />successors from<br />  other dynasties not destroy it or write by the side that the<br />kalvettu is not<br />  &#40;completely&#41; true. Even in a present-day democracy, a government<br />tries to<br />  remove &#40;or undermine&#41; the visible victories of a previous,<br />opposition party<br />  government. A Pandya king would not have hesistated to call the<br />bluff of a<br />  Chozha&#39;s kalvettu &#40;and vice versa&#41;.<br /> <br />  Does this mean the kalvettus were very close to the truth &#40;or&#41; that<br />only<br />  hidden kalvettus survived to see our times &#40;or&#41; the kings intelligently<br />  inscribed on places like temple walls which no hindu king will dare to<br />  touch.<br /> <br />  Copper plates could have easily been hidden. Hence, the doubt is<br />regarding<br />  kalvettus only.<br /> <br />  Siva</div></blockquote></div>
