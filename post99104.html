			<div class="content">References to Tamil Royal Dynasties and Tamil Countries, in the<br />original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa<br /><br /><br />Dear Readers,<br />The original Sanskrit Mahabharatha written by Sage - Viyasa, has many<br />references on the Tamil Royal Dynasties, and on the Tamil Countries<br />of South India and their geographical locations within, that were<br />known during the period of the Mahabharatha, which I trust will be of<br />much interest to the research - scholars and students of Tamil<br />History and append below same to their benefit.<br /><br />I have selected the version of Mahabharatha translated into English<br />Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original Sanskrit Text of<br />Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers (Pvt)<br />Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been extracted.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />[1] ".......Dhritarashtra (i.ee.Thiritarasra) said, `Hear O Sanjaya<br />the celestial feeats of Vasudeva feats that Govinda achieved and the<br />like of which no otheer person hath ever been able to<br />achieve......The mighty Krishna also slew the valiant king of<br />Chedis.......all these he vanquished in battle. The Avantis......the<br />Cholas, the Pandyas......as also Sakas, and the Yavanas with<br />followers were all vanquished by him ........'<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - DRONA PARVA, PAGE 23.<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above it is noted that Krishna defeated the Cholas and<br />Pandyas in a battle prior to Baratha war.<br /><br />[2] "........When that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic<br />warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. They<br />consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of<br />Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with the<br />Dravida forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas,<br />surrounded by a mighty array, all possessed of broad chests, long<br />arms, tall statures an large eyes. Decked with ornaments, possessed<br />of red teeth, endued with the prowess of infuriate elephants, attired<br />in robes of diverse colours, smeared with powere scents, armed with<br />swords and nooses, capable of restraining mightty elephants,<br />companions in death, and never eserting one other, equipped with<br />quivers, bearing bows adorne with long locks, an agreeable in speech<br />were the combatants of the infantry files led by Sayaki, belonging to<br />Andhra tribe, retinue with fierce forms and great energy. Other brave<br />warriors such as the Chedis, the Panchalas, the Kaikayas, the<br />Karushas, the Kosalas, the Kanchis, and the Maghadhas also rushed<br />forward........"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 25. KULUTAS PAGE 26<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above it is very clear Pandyas, Cholas, Keralas who were the<br />Cheras, the Kanchi undoubtedly the Thondaimandala kings whose capital<br />was at Kanchi. all fought on the side of the Pandavas.<br /><br />[3] ".......I behold the Ganga, the Satudru, the Sita, the Yamuna,<br />and the Kausiki, the Charmanwati, the Vetravati, the Chandrabaga, the<br />Saraswati, the Sindhu, the Vipasa, and the Godavari, the Vaswokasara,<br />the Nalini and the Narmada, the Tamara, and the Venna also of<br />delightful current and sacred waters, the Suvenna, the Krishna-venna,<br />the Irama,and the Mahanadi, the Vitasti, O great king and that large<br />river Cavery, the one also O tiger ! among men the Visalya and the<br />Kimpuna also......"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 381.<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above it is noted that in the days of Mahabaratha the river<br />Cavery river would have been very wide with more flow of water as the<br />pronoun "large river" is only used to river Cavery, when many of the<br />other rivers of India was being referred simply as rivers in<br />Mahabaratha. The above also describes of the warrirors from the Tamil<br />countries and of their forces ,valour and armoury.<br /><br />[4] "Markandeya said `O bull of the Bharata race even Rama suffered<br />unparalled misery, for the evil minded Ravana king of Rakshasas,<br />having recourse to deceit and overpowering the vulture Jatayu<br />forcibly carried away his wife Sita from his asylum in the woods.<br />Indeed Rama with the help of Sugriva brought her back, constructing a<br />bridge across the sea, and consuming Lanka with his keen-edged<br />arrows........"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 533<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above we note Markandeya in explaing the sufferings<br />undergone by kings prior to Pandavas refers to the Rama and Ravana<br />story being the Ramayana. Hence it is very clear Mahabaratha war took<br />place after tthe Ramayana story.<br /><br />[5] ".......then going to the south Karna vanquished the mighty<br />charioteers and in Dakshinatya the Suta's son entered into conflict<br />with Rukmi.......Having met with Rukmi, Karna repaired to Pandya and<br />the mountain Sri. And by fighting he made Karala(Kerala ??) king<br />Nila, Venudari's son and other best of kings living in the southern<br />direction pay tribute....."<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 502<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above we note Karna who was with the Kauravas went to Pandya<br />country and the Kerala country down the southern region of India and<br />exacted tributes from them.<br /><br />[6] "......The river Indus, the five rivers (of the Punjab) the Sone,<br />the Devika the Saraswati, the Ganga, the Satakumba, the Sarayu, the<br />Ganaki, the Charmanwati, the Mahi, the Medha, the Medhatithi the<br />three rivers Tamravati the Vetravati and the Kausiki, the Tamasa the<br />Narmada, the Godavari, the Vena the Upavena, the Bhima, the Vadawa<br />the Bharati the Suprayoga, the Kaveri, the Murmura the Tungavenna,<br />the Krishnavenna and the Kapila these rivers O Bharatha ! are said to<br />be the mothers of the fires......."<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 451/52<br /><br />Observation:<br />Here too reference is made to the river Kaveri flowing through the<br />Chola<br /><br />[7] Krishnavenna ".......Kshatriyas assembled in that amphitheatre,<br />each desirous of winning of winning the daughter of Drupatha those<br />princes Karna, Duryodhana, Salwa, Salya, Aswatthaman, Kratha,<br />Sunitha, Vakra, the ruler of Kalinga, and Banga, Pandiya Paundra, the<br />ruler of Videha, the chief of the Yavanas, and many other sons and<br />grandsons of kings, sovereigns of territories with eyes like lotus<br />petals, one after another began to exhibit prowess for (winning) that<br />maiden of unrivalled beauty....."<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, ADIPARVA, PAGE 373/374<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above it is noted that the Pandya king and the Yavana king<br />were among many others who exhibited their prowess to win the<br />princess Draupathi at the Suyamvaram festivity.<br /><br />[8] "........O king there are also four oceans, the river<br />Bhagirathee, the Kalindi, the Vidisa, the Venwa, the Narmada of rapid<br />current, the Vipasa, the Satadu, the Chandrabhaga, the Saraswati, the<br />Iravati, the Vitasta, the Sindu, the Devanadi, the Godavari,<br />Krishnavenwa, and that queen of rivers the Kaveri......."<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 21<br /><br />Observation:<br />Here too it is evident that during the days of Mahabaratha the river<br />Kaveri which flowed through the Chola country was held in high esteem<br />by the North Indians among all other rivers of India.<br /><br />[9] ".......the son of Pandu (Sahadeva)........the hero brought under<br />his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the Dravidas<br />along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas the<br />Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of Atavi<br />and that of Yavanas......."<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 65/66<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: he above we note one of the Pandava brothers namely Sahadeva<br />exaced tributes from Dravidas and the kings of north Kerala.<br /><br />[10] ".......O bull of the Bharata race having heard of king<br />Yudhishthura's sacrifice hundreds of other Kshatriyas acquainted with<br />the nature of the sacrifice with joyous hearts came there from<br />various countries,........the kings of Vanga and Kalinga, and Akastha<br />and Kuntala, and the kings of Malavas and the Andhrakas and the<br />Dravidas and the Singhalas and the king of Kashmira........"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABHAPARVA, PAGE 70/71<br /><br />Observation:<br />We note from the above to attend the Yuthistra's sacrifice (Yaga)<br />among many who came were the Dravidas and the Singhalas of Sri Lanka<br />too have came.<br /><br />[11] ".....and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avant Pandya......"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 86<br /><br />Observation:<br />A reference is made to a Pandiya king<br /><br />[12] ".......Duryodhana said O sinless one listen to me as I describe<br />that large mass of wealth consisting of various kinds of tribute<br />presented unto Yudhishthira by the kings of the earth......the kings<br />of Chola and Pandya though they brought numberless jars of gold<br />filled with fragrant sandal juice from the hills of Malaya, and loads<br />of sandal and the aloe wood from the Dardduras hills and many gems of<br />great brilliancy and fine cloths inlaid with gold didnot obtain<br />permission to enter, and the king of the Singhalas gave those best of<br />sea-born gems called the lapis lazuli and heaps of pearls also and<br />hundreds of coverlets for elephants. And numberless dark-coloured men<br />with the ends of their eyes red as copper attired in cloths decked<br />with gems waited at the gate with those presents......"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 105<br /><br />Observation:<br />From: the above we note the complete description of all items the<br />Cholas the Pandyas and the Sinhalas from Sri Lanka brought to king<br />Yuthistra as present on the occasion of the great Yaga conducted by<br />him.<br /><br />[13] ".......and even Krishna himself.......addressing Yudhishthira<br />said That prosperity which the sons of Pritha had acquired at<br />Indraprastha and which unobtainable by other kings was beheld by me<br />at the Rajasuya sacrifice at which besides I saw all kings even those<br />of the Vangas and Angas and Paundras and Odras and Cholas and<br />Dravidas and Andhakas and the chiefs of many islands and countries on<br />the sea-board as also of frontier states including the rulers of the<br />Sinhalas, the barbarous Mlecchas, the natives of Lanka, and all the<br />kings of the west by hundreds, and all the chiefs of the sea-coast,<br />and the kings of the Pahlavas and the Daradas and the various tribes<br />of the Kiratas and Yavanas and Sakras and the Harahunas and<br />Chinas ........"<br /><br />MAHABHARATHA - BY K.M.GANGULI VANAPARVA, PAGE 110<br /><br />Observation:<br />Krishna himself personally saw the Cholas, Dravidas, and the Sinhalas<br />being present at the Yaga sacrifice which he confirmed to Yuthistra.<br /><br />[14] "........Proceeding next to the mountain Rishabha in Pandya<br />worshipped by the gods, one obtains the merit of the Vajpeya<br />sacrifice and rejoices in heaven. One should next proceed to the<br />river Kaveri, frequented by Apsaras. Bathing there O monarch ! and<br />obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Touching next the<br />waters of the tirtha called Kanya on the shores of the sea one is<br />cleansed from every sin. Proceeding next to Gokarna celebrated over<br />the three worlds and which is situate O best of kings ! in the midst<br />of the deep (sea ??? - Trincomalee of Sri Lanka???)and referenced by<br />all the worlds........worship the lord of Uma, one should worship<br />Isana, fasting there for three nights. By this he acquireth the merit<br />of the horse-sacrifce and the status of Gnapatya by staying there for<br />twelve nights one's soul is clensed of all sins........"<br /><br />MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 192<br /><br />Observation:<br />Here we note the description of the mountain in the Pandya country,<br />about the river Kaveri, the thirtha the Kanyakumari, and Gokarna it<br />seems to refer to the modern Thirukkoneswaram in north-east Sri<br />Lanka, a Shiva shrine.<br /><br />[15] "......Dhaumya continued, Listen O Bharata I shall now narrate<br />to thee in detail according to my knowledge the sacred tirthas of the<br />south......O Yudhishthira in the country of the Pandyas are the<br />tirthas named Agastya and Varuna ! and O bull among men there amongst<br />the Pandavas is the thirtha called Kumaris. Listen O son of Kunti I<br />shall now describe Tamraparni. In that asylum the gods had undergone<br />penances impelled by the desire of obtaining salvation. In that<br />region also is the lake of Gokarna which is celebrated over the three<br />worlds hath an abundance of cool waters and is sacred auspicious and<br />capable O child of producing great merit. That lake is extremely<br />difficult of access to men of unpurified souls.

Dyno eggs - fossils etc. Near Ariyalur we<br />have a fossil forest!<br /><br />Good to know that Cholas, Cheras, Kanchis & Pandyas are found in<br />Mahabarath! Thiruvarur Musunda chravarthy is found in Devasura War!<br />In reciprocation of his services, the diety worshipped by Indira came<br />to Thiruvarur - hence the Wings!<br /><br />Fondly, SB</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Mr.Sridhar,<br />Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sriraman and have very recently joined the PONNIYINSELVAN group.<br />I have long been interested in subjects, such as deciphering of inscriptions etc., but as I have mentioned in an earlier mail, have not been able to get proper resources for learning these subjects. History is something that we have to learn properly or not at all. I am sure that most group members would agree upon this point.<br />I, for one have a lot of interest in the subject, and have joined specifically to learn from the discussions. As such I may not have any immediate significant contributions to make...except may be to clarify certain doubts. So I would beg you to excuse my naivety and not be disappointed if I just read and delete. Anyway I am trying to catch up by reading certain books etc.<br /><br />Incidentally, may I ask your source of the mail below...which talks about the Pandyas,Cholas etc. participating in the Mahabarata?<br />Another small <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of information that I happen to have for the members...are you all aware that the current edition of Mahabharata is actually the 3rd Release?<br /><br />Regards and Cheers,<br />Sriraman<br /><br />Sridhar Rathinam  wrote:<br />Dear SB<br />very interesting mail but I have a few concerns about the verses<br /><br />1.There is mentions of andras karnatakas and keralas...All these were<br />linguistic states which emerged in later days...The kerala was Chera<br />kingdom The Karnataka of Today was part Ganga and part Hoisalya nd<br />part Chalukya and like wise andra was chalukya kigdoms that is not<br />beleivable  <br />@@@@@his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dravidas<br />    along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas the<br />    Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of<br />  Atavi<br />    and that of Yavanas......."<br />@@@@</div></blockquote><br />2.Krishna did not fight in the great war he was just the<br />charioteer...this following statement counters that@@@@<br />[21] ".........Vasudeva's son Krishna ......It was he that slew<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>king<br />    Pandya by striking his breast against his, and moved down the<br />    Kalingas in battle.

These are names which occurred in the ancient list of 56 or 64? counteries starting from Anga,Vanga,Kalinga,Kashmira etc.<br />2.Tradition has it that Pandyas traced themselves back to Pandu who in turn was of the lunar race.So the Pandya king should have been on the side of the Pandavas in the MBh war.<br />GR<br /><br />Sridhar Rathinam  wrote:<br />Dear SB<br />very interesting mail but I have a few concerns about the verses<br /><br />1.There is mentions of andras karnatakas and keralas...All these were<br />linguistic states which emerged in later days...The kerala was Chera<br />kingdom The Karnataka of Today was part Ganga and part Hoisalya nd<br />part Chalukya and like wise andra was chalukya kigdoms that is not<br />beleivable  <br />@@@@@his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dravidas<br />    along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas the<br />    Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of<br />  Atavi<br />    and that of Yavanas......."<br />@@@@</div></blockquote><br />2.Krishna did not fight in the great war he was just the<br />charioteer...this following statement counters that@@@@<br />[21] ".........Vasudeva's son Krishna ......It was he that slew<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>king<br />    Pandya by striking his breast against his, and moved down the<br />    Kalingas in battle.

			<div class="content">Thanks Prof<br /><br />I am not saying that these names were not there they are restorations<br />of old names maybe but the point I am raising is they were not one<br />single state during the epic times eg there wasnt a tamilnadu or<br />tamils there were chera chozha pallava pandya kingdoms.....agree?<br />like wise Ganga, Chalukya, rashtrakooda and Kalinga ..kingdoms not<br />karnatakas and andras....<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>2.Tradition has it that Pandyas traced themselves back to Pandu who<br />in turn was of the lunar race.So the Pandya king should have been on</div></blockquote>the side of the Pandavas in the MBh war.<br /><br /><br />Thats exactly my point so why would the pandavas fight and kill a<br />pandya king as it is said in the verses??<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Sri<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Sridhar Rathinam  wrote:<br />  Dear SB<br />  very interesting mail but I have a few concerns about the verses<br /> <br />  1.There is mentions of andras karnatakas and keralas...All these<br />were<br />  linguistic states which emerged in later days...The kerala was<br />Chera<br />  kingdom The Karnataka of Today was part Ganga and part Hoisalya nd<br />  part Chalukya and like wise andra was chalukya kigdoms that is not<br />  beleivable  <br />  @@@@@his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the<br />    Dravidas<br />      along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas<br />the<br />      Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of<br />    Atavi<br />      and that of Yavanas......."<br />  @@@@<br /> <br />  2.Krishna did not fight in the great war he was just the<br />  charioteer...this following statement counters that@@@@<br />  [21] ".........Vasudeva&#39;s son Krishna ......It was he that slew<br />    king<br />      Pandya by striking his breast against his, and moved down the<br />      Kalingas in battle. Burnt by him the city of Varanasi remained<br />  for<br />      many years without a king......"<br />     <br />  Here it states that Cholas,pandyas and Cheras fought with the<br />  pandavas if so why would Krishna kill the pandya king?<br /> <br />     <br />      [2] "........When that host was being thus struck and slain by<br />    heroic<br />      warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us.<br />  They<br />      consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of<br />      Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with<br />    the<br />      Dravida forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas,<br />      surrounded by a mighty array, all possessed of broad chests,<br />long<br />      arms, tall statures an large eyes.
