			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Posted by singanallur ramaswamy  using id singanallur ramaswamy </span><br /><br /><br /> <br />Hi all,<br /> <br />I have said in my previous post that I had purchased TM by Palaniappa Bros.a few years ago and still possess it, but like many of my posts in this forum it has been drowned by an avalanche of responses (at least four per person at one time). I am wondering whether there's any point in me remaining a member of this forum which has been hijacked by a few members.<br /> <br />Anyway, like so many others I have read the novel umpteen times and have always felt the movie never did justice to Kalaimani's writing. For example the character of mattalakkara varadan is very well etched in the novel by inthe movie it has made inti a miniscule one and played by TRRamachandran.<br /> <br />But the choice of Saraswati for vadivambal is spot on. Vadivambal is one ofthe greatest characters in Tamil<br />novels, and Savadal Vaithy (played by Nagesh) meets his match in her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br />To:  ponniyinselvan@...: abhivencat@...: Fri, 25 Apr 2008 03:02:35 +0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Thillana Mohanambal<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />HiVery TrueMr. Vishwanathan s/o kothamangkalam subbu also mentioned that they were on the look out for some of his father's writings which were missing.venketesh--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "S.Pasupathy"  wrote:   It is my understanding ( gained from Kothamangalam Subbu's daughter)  that Vikatan has agreed to bring out ALL of his works (includinghis   poems which were never published ) ..in many volumes.. very soon.

Lot of people     do not even know this classic was a book, story serialised in AV, and     with really nice picturesby Gopulu. It was very difficult to treat     with complex descriptions ofintricacies of music and dance, I got     through two chapters with great difficulty with my grandmother's aid.     Would love to read it again but unfortunately I don't think it is     available.        The movie was also good but very commerialised version of the story     with much older actors.        If anyone knows more would be glad to know!!

			<div class="content">Also on the same lines very few books have been made<br />into good movies, the true test of that is when the<br />book writer acknowledges that it is so. 'To kill a<br />mockingbird' is one of the few movies that has been<br />acknowledged this way.<br /><br />'Gone with the wind' same on the lines of Dr Zhivago<br />is a nice movie but very pale in comparison with the<br />book. Guns of Navarone etc are potboilers, not<br />classics, they are written probably with intention<br />that someone will make movies out of them.<br /><br />R K Narayan was horrified at how his Guide was made<br />into a movie - Guide is a small book that too, not a<br />sweeping novel. It could have been made into a movie,<br />RKN disliked the glamor that Dev Anand introduced that<br />took away the simplicity of the book and his writing.<br />He writes two chapters of this in 'My Days', well<br />worth reading to see how world of movies operates!!<br />BTW Guide, like TM is a good 'commercial' movie with<br />great music and good performances by Waheeda Rehman.<br />Just like TM, don't compare it to the book that is<br />all.<br /><br />--- Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Don&#39;t mean to turn this into a debate ,but I<br />  disagree<br />  that TM was made into a great movie.

Hi<br />  This<br />    is a general sighing when great books are made<br />  into<br />    movies. It will not be possible for any director<br />  to<br />    bring the entire story, that too a &#39;thodar naval&#39;<br />    into a 2/3 hr movie. I havent read TM, but the<br />  movie<br />    is so good that I would have watched that more<br />  than<br />    50 times, &#40; recently in ths SunTV&#41;. If you take<br />    Davinci code, it was not great movie, eventhough<br />  its<br />    director Ron Howard did his best to bring out all<br />    the scenes. But the performanc of the actors,<br />  mainly<br />    Tom hanks pulled the movie down unlike TM. by<br />  the<br />    by, there are some movies which will mach the<br />    reputation of the book or surpass that.

Its a really nice<br />movie.<br /><br />I think, to be fair to the director, its hard for the movie to match the<br />book.

The movies always fall short of the book.<br />I think movie is a different medium and shouldn't be compared to the book. A<br />movie at a single moment addresses more than 300 individuals from all walks<br />of life hence has to be made in that manner, in other words compromises are<br />essential.<br />A book on the other hand, addresses only one person at any given<br />moment. There is always a common'ness about the individuals who buy that<br />particular book. Also the reader tends to ignore the some flaws (almost<br />always present) in his favorite author's books whereas the movie goer shows<br />his displeasure then and there (whistle,catcall,etc).<br /><br />I feel its a totally unfair comparision which we sometime take the liberty<br />of doing.<br /><br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /><br /><br />On 4/25/08, Malathi Mahadevan  wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Don&#39;t mean to turn this into a debate ,but I disagree<br />  that TM was made into a great movie.

			<div class="content">Rahul, there are movies that have matched books - to<br />give you a few examples Kill a Mockingbird, Color<br />Purple, the televised version of Malgudi Days, several<br />books by Agatha Christie and Charles Dickens.<br /><br />I agree with you, it is an extremely hard task and<br />logistics are different. On the other hand, many film<br />makers take the 'pot boiler' route very easily, just<br />on the pretext that it is difficult and not consumable<br />by masses. Read RK Narayan's comments on how Guide was<br />made into a movie, it is quite enlightening.<br /><br />TM was a good potboiler at best, the book was a real<br />thesis on classical music and dance, it could have<br />been made into a movie but perhaps with limited mass<br />appeal.<br /><br />--- Rahul dhinakaran <br />wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi;<br />  I haven&#39;t read the book TM but have seen the movie a<br />  few times as my dad<br />  loves it &#40;a Nagesh fan&#41; and forces us to watch it<br />  also!
