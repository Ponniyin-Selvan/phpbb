SPECULATIONS OF THEIR ORIGIN.. INCLUDING<br />WHETHER THEY ARE JAINS... KAADVARKON PANDYA IS CONSIDERED KALABRA -<br />WHO IS DESIGNATED NAAYANMAR.<br /><br />6 to 8th AD :: " Jithath Simha Vishnu, Thanja Haraha " is the<br />inscription (as you rightly mentioned ) in Saskrit - in Rock Fort<br />Temple, Trichy, CONFIRMING that Trichy - Thanjavur - Cauvery Belt<br />was under Pallava Rule from Simhavishnu Days ..<br /><br />Around 850 AD : (Recall <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - Kalki - Chozha details) :: Vijayalayan<br />conquored and occupied Thanjai. Thiruvalangadu Copper plates are<br />silent on the Mutharayas who were subdued. Our Group has discussed<br />this extensively - thanks to Srilankan member SriHari :: SAATAN<br />PAZHIYILI was the Mutharaya - who constructed a Siva temple and<br />named after him as Pazhayileeswaram in Naarthamalai (enroute<br />Pudukkottai from Trichy) - around mid 9th century (850 or so ). But<br />from Senthalai (Near Nemam / Thirukkaattupalli inscriptions) we have<br />KAVARAN MAARAN and Co., as Mutharayas operated from Thanjavur around<br />that period. So it was postulated that Two Sects of Mutharayas -<br />one Around the bordering with Pandyas at Pudukkottai and other sect<br />at Nemam - close to Thanjai and most probably this sect of<br />Mutharayas would have been conquered by Vijayalayan.<br /><br />Dr. Nagaswamy, on his study of Muthurasas postulated that the<br />VRIDHARAJA found at Mysore around 5th AD are MUTHURAJAS from TN who<br />paved way for this sect and probably this is time for evolution of<br />Kannada language !<br /><br />Therefore with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions (pre Sangam) - Adhiyaman<br />period inscriptions in Thirukkoilore / Dharmapuri (Sangam period),<br />we have Sanskrit / Grantha mix inscriptions followed and then Tamil<br />inscriptions again.... with Sankrit separated. For instance<br />Thiruvalangadu Copper plates copper plates (Released by Rajendra I)<br />comprised of Sanskrit Verses first followed by Tamil scripts..<br /><br />PLEASE PLACE KARIKALA around 500 -550 AD only.<br /><br />Telugu / Kannada / Malayam are of later period in comparison with<br />Tamil - almost in that Order.<br /><br />Linguistic experts may step in and enlighten.<br /><br />regards/ sps<br />========================</div>

			<div class="content">Hello<br /><br />Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of Mathura's destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where Mt.Meru is ( a philosophical quote).<br />The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis to Sanskrit is somewhat known.

			<div class="content">When we talk of dating pre historic ( i mean known history)events <br />like lemuria we should also see the parallel development of mankind<br /><br /><br /><br />wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments of an advancing <br />civilisation.<br /><br />Most historians regard the wheel as one of the oldest and most <br />important inventions, which originated in ancient Sumer in <br />Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the 5th millennium BC, originally in the <br />function of potter's wheels. The wheel reached India and Pakistan <br />with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd millennium BC<br /><br />so did lemuria function with out a wheel?<br /><br />LEMURIA<br /><br />Geologists today regard sunken continents as physical <br />impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of continental <br />plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.<br /><br /><br />Though the living modern lemurs are only found in Madagascar and <br />several surrounding islands, the biogeography of extinct lemurs <br />extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the name Lemuria, which <br />was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater in an article "The <br />Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of Science. Puzzled <br />by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India, but <br />not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed that Madagascar <br />and India had once been part of a larger continent, which he named <br />"Lemuria" for its lemurs.<br /><br />Sclater's theory was hardly unusual for his time. The acceptance of <br />Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species <br />from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to the acceptance of <br />continental drift, biologists frequently postulated submerged land <br />masses in order to account for populations of land-based species now <br />separated by barriers of water. <br /><br />In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research vessel in the <br />Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a continent about a third <br />of the size of Australia sank about 20 million years ago. Samples <br />showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90 million-year-old <br />sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity of dinosaur fossil <br />evidence and will help to understand the breakup of the Indian and <br />Australian land masses; it does not support the concept of Lemuria OF <br />6TH MILLIENIUM BC<br /><br />regards<br />venketesh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, ravi venu  wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hello<br />  <br />  Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of Mathura&#39;s <br />destruction.

			<div class="content">The Lemurian (& Atlantis) continent was super developed by the time the reminder of the world was seen to even discovering fire.<br />We can only produce logical conclusions for these facts. For ex: Darwins theory, It is my personal opinion (along with many religious sects) that the theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a layman would be, if Man was to have come from the monkey, why are monkeys not becoming men any more? Geological environmental situations ? I would not buy that. So how does this context relate with Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that creations has been simultaneous and not based out of migration from one land to another(which is a by product at some places). Human evolution has been spontaneous and there are always super humans and normal / under evolved humans on earth.

For ex: Darwins theory, It is my personal<br />    opinion &#40;along with many religious sects&#41; that the<br />    theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a<br />    layman would be, if Man was to have come from the<br />    monkey, why are monkeys not becoming men any more?<br />    Geological environmental situations ? I would not<br />    buy that. So how does this context relate with<br />    Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that<br />    creations has been simultaneous and not based out of<br />    migration from one land to another&#40;which is a by<br />    product at some places&#41;. Human evolution has been<br />    spontaneous and there are always super humans and<br />    normal / under evolved humans on earth.<br />    Comparitively, New york is more developed than a<br />    remote village in Africa or the aborginees of<br />    australia. In about a few thousand years later, when<br />    the world graphics change and it reconstructs itself<br />    &#40;as it did during the ice age&#41;, there may be a place<br />    where the future archeologists will<br />    find that we did not exist and the native<br />    australians were the first ones to figure out<br />    farming. <br />    <br />    Again this is a theory and logical. There are<br />    relative figuratives when we look to religion to<br />    side with this theory though. for ex: those who<br />    believe in hinduism can say that Super humans<br />    &#40;persons like Rama / ravana etc&#41; coexisted with<br />    humans &#40; common men / sages etc&#41; and super evolved<br />    animals &#40;hanuman etc&#41;. In short creation has been<br />    spontanic and there is no practical timeline to<br />    adjudicate the fact that this event happened only at<br />    this point in time etc. These are guidelines for<br />    this era. Creation &#40;shristi&#41; has been simultaneous<br />    and we are only working on a sequential program once<br />    we figure out the non sequential process of creation<br />    it will give various answers to unsolved mysteries.<br />    <br />    Hence, according to me, the real origins of physical<br />    findings on 1st tamil sangam are a very difficult<br />    pill to swallow.
