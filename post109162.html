			<div class="content">Thanks for the link Satish, I was looking for a good Kamba Ramayana link for long.<br />Â <br />Yes it is true that Valmiki's epic was the original and all the rest evolved out of it. Robert Goldman one of the oldest western scholars of the epic also writes that *most* of the epic seems to have been written by a single author who is a man, there fore Valmiki.<br />Â <br />Kambar made it more palatable yes. In the process Kambar also introduced morals and values of his generation which made the epic much more complex than the simple story it was andÂ more easy to critique by DK/DMK ites. I have the greatest respect for Kambar's poetry but to keep in mind both Kambar and Valmiki are not historians, they are poets, and we have to give margin to that. <br />Â <br />It is a good idea to avoid taking the Ramayana or the Mahabharata literallyand getting overtly sentimental over whether or not it is fact. First of all those of us who are keen on history should not be very upset when it is not in line with our sentiments (including <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> itself). There are many partsof the RAmayana that are completely unpalatable - we talked about the horse sacrifice once before. Paula Richman, another modern day scholar, points out that Sita's fire ordeal and the Uttara Ramayana clearly appear to be interpolations (much to my delight, now I can keep my Rama and my feminist ideals intact!!). My western educated 13 year old nephew wants to know how and why the Mahabharat is any less violent than some of his video games. I like to stick with Gandhi, that it was an anology to wars of the mind.

			<div class="content">Hi Malathi & Satish<br /><br />The original is Ramayana itself. That was live, all others were<br />comments based on the live relay.<br /><br />Valmiki got the first rights to the relay. Kamban, Tulsidas etc had<br />second rights at other times, again direct telecasts only.<br /><br />Original is Rama's itself. Copy right belongs to Rama and not to<br />Valmiki. Valmiki had the greatest privilege of getting the grant from<br />Lord himself.<br /><br />Ratnakar becomes Valmiki who infact 'documents' the ramayana. <br /><br />I will be taking of the grace which Lord gave to Alwars and others if<br />I say that they got the Ramayana based out of their studies from<br />Valmiki's words.<br /><br />Beeshma recites Sahasranama on battle field, does it mean he is the<br />owner of Sahasranama ? Ofcourse, only Beeshma was up in the level of<br />getting the relay of Sahasranama.<br /><br />If you observe, he not only sees Lord in 1000 forms, he also hears<br />(and relays) conversations of Lord Shiva and devas etc. The<br />Sahasranama apparently, is live relay, if we tune ourselves to that<br />level - we can also see/hear it...<br />Ramayana and Mahabaratha did happen and.... did not happen also...<br />purely depends on the intellectual level of the reader. Perfect<br />example of saying deivam endral athu deivam. I believe they happened<br />and are happening every time, the time here is the question of eons...<br /><br />FYI:My Guru Arunagiri has written a lot of Ramayana scenes which I<br />dont remember reading in some of the Ramayana versions. His visions<br />are obviously not from any books. <br /><br />again.... intha vaaram kuzappam vaaram <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-- R<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Malathi Mahadevan <br />wrote: <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>From Vyasar Virundhu - Ganapathi Rayasam -<br />   <br />  Parasara Maharishiyin Puthrar Pugazh petra Vyasa Bhagavan.

Even great <br />authors would be influenced by the times they lived in.Therefore it <br />is not just right to call Kambaramayanam by Kambar as duplicate <br />though Satish might not have intended it.His intention to call it as <br />duplicate would be that the same was sourced originally from Kavi <br />Valmiki's Ramayana. Moreover, with respect to criticism of the Epics <br />by DMK and DK people, We should accept them in right spirit in an <br />open, democratic society. Otherwise, we may land up in a <br />closed ,obscurantic society incapable of seeing what is right and <br />just and go by what is dished out by self serving knowledge <br />dispensers. <br />Though my background is from city based with rural experience,I <br />greatly appreciate the good work done by the Periyar EVR in <br />eradicating irrational and often unjust beliefs. His DK/DMK <br />followers actions were/are not exactly flattering and the open, <br />literate and equity based society will take care of their <br />excesses.Wish you all and raring to hear more from all.</div>

Robert Goldman one of the oldest western scholars<br />  of the epic also writes that *most* of the epic seems to have been<br />  written by a single author who is a man, there fore Valmiki.<br />     <br />    Kambar made it more palatable yes. In the process Kambar also<br />  introduced morals and values of his generation which made the epic<br />  much more complex than the simple story it was and more easy to<br />  critique by DK/DMK ites. I have the greatest respect for Kambar&#39;s<br />  poetry but to keep in mind both Kambar and Valmiki are not <br />historians,<br />  they are poets, and we have to give margin to that. <br />     <br />    It is a good idea to avoid taking the Ramayana or the Mahabharata<br />  literally and getting overtly sentimental over whether or not it is<br />  fact. First of all those of us who are keen on history should not be<br />  very upset when it is not in line with our sentiments &#40;including <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym><br />  itself&#41;. There are many parts of the RAmayana that are completely<br />  unpalatable - we talked about the horse sacrifice once before. Paula<br />  Richman, another modern day scholar, points out that Sita&#39;s fire<br />  ordeal and the Uttara Ramayana clearly appear to be interpolations<br />  &#40;much to my delight, now I can keep my Rama and my feminist ideals<br />  intact!!&#41;. My western educated 13 year old nephew wants to know how<br />  and why the Mahabharat is any less violent than some of his video<br />  games. I like to stick with Gandhi, that it was an anology to wars <br />of<br />  the mind. I dont&#39; know anything better for him and happen to like <br />the<br />  Mahabharat very much.<br />     <br />    Malathi<br />    <br />    --- On Sat, 8/23/08, SatishKumar Arunachalam  wrote: <br />    <br />    From: SatishKumar Arunachalam <br />    Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma<br />    To:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />    Date: Saturday, August 23, 2008, 4:38 PM<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Deepak,<br />    <br />    You yourself said it is an interpretation.

Surely Kamban had <br />followed the original by Valmiki while making certain modificiations. <br />This, as Deepak said, however does not take away the historicity of <br />Ramayana, from Kamban. It is just that we Tamizhs did not classify it <br />as history, but as ilakkiyam. Whatever name we give it, Kamban's work <br />is atleast 90% faithful to the original. The remaining 10% falls into <br />the category that Malathis says, "creepers". This is a very <br />inevitable one.<br /><br />But onething for sure is that Ramayana has made a very deep impact in <br />many parts of South and South East Asia, that every one <br />started "localizing" it for their pleasures, just like a Remake <br />Movie. The pathetic part is some of those localisations had resulted <br />in complete deviation from the original, like the ones, where Sita <br />and Rama are said to be siblings or Sita is said to Ravana's daughter <br />etc. But all these variations, if analysed properly (I haven't done <br />it) will definitely bring out a common holding point faithful to the <br />original (hi)story line. In this case of Ramayana, this could be the <br />win of Dharmic forces over Adharmic forces.<br /><br />The reason I said this is, the word "duplicate", to my opinion, <br />seemed to be too raw and was giving a very bad picture about Kamban. <br />As you know the usage of the word Duplicate is done to point out to a <br />very cheap replica of original. Surely Kamban's treatise is not in <br />this category. Just that I did not like the word "Duplicate" for all <br />the greatness of Kamban's work<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />  modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />  &#40;Actually I should say polish&#41;.

Yes, Kamban has indeed tuned it in line <br />with the "pazhantamizhar marabu". This was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> different from the <br />ones followed in Northern India. So as rightly pointed by you, Kamban <br />wrote it to suit the views based on demographical variations. <br /><br />For example, Ravana carrying Sita episode. Valimiki presents this as <br />Ravana, holding Sita's hands while pulling away. (Example of what <br />Satish told regarding Valmiki presenting it as it is) While Kamban, <br />portrays is saying that Ravana just took the entire piece of land in <br />which Sita and Ravana was standing. This was well in line with <br />Tamizhar Marabu where in a woman is not supposed to be touched by <br />anyone other than her husband. <br /><br />Every such variations based on local customs and traditions is very <br />much present in Ramayana. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</div>

This is a very <br />  inevitable one.<br />  <br />  But onething for sure is that Ramayana has made a very deep impact <br />in <br />  many parts of South and South East Asia, that every one <br />  started "localizing" it for their pleasures, just like a Remake <br />  Movie. The pathetic part is some of those localisations had <br />resulted <br />  in complete deviation from the original, like the ones, where Sita <br />  and Rama are said to be siblings or Sita is said to Ravana&#39;s <br />daughter <br />  etc. But all these variations, if analysed properly &#40;I haven&#39;t done <br />  it&#41; will definitely bring out a common holding point faithful to <br />the <br />  original &#40;hi&#41;story line. In this case of Ramayana, this could be <br />the <br />  win of Dharmic forces over Adharmic forces.<br />  <br />  The reason I said this is, the word "duplicate", to my opinion, <br />  seemed to be too raw and was giving a very bad picture about <br />Kamban. <br />  As you know the usage of the word Duplicate is done to point out to <br />a <br />  very cheap replica of original. Surely Kamban&#39;s treatise is not in <br />  this category. Just that I did not like the word "Duplicate" for <br />all <br />  the greatness of Kamban&#39;s work<br />  <br />  <br />    But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />    modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />    &#40;Actually I should say polish&#41;. Kambars character might look much<br />    better that valmiki&#39;s, because valmiki gave things as is, where as<br />    Kambar polished it to make it more suitable for tamil literature.<br />  <br />  This is absolutely correct. Yes, Kamban has indeed tuned it in line <br />  with the "pazhantamizhar marabu". This was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> different from the <br />  ones followed in Northern India. So as rightly pointed by you, <br />Kamban <br />  wrote it to suit the views based on demographical variations. <br />  <br />  For example, Ravana carrying Sita episode. Valimiki presents this <br />as <br />  Ravana, holding Sita&#39;s hands while pulling away. &#40;Example of what <br />  Satish told regarding Valmiki presenting it as it is&#41; While Kamban, <br />  portrays is saying that Ravana just took the entire piece of land <br />in <br />  which Sita and Ravana was standing. This was well in line with <br />  Tamizhar Marabu where in a woman is not supposed to be touched by <br />  anyone other than her husband. <br />  <br />  Every such variations based on local customs and traditions is very <br />  much present in Ramayana. <br />  <br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</div></blockquote></div>
