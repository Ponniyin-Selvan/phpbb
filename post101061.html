The installation of <br />Siva idol<br />may well be taken for the establishment of a Siva temple which is <br />called as<br />Thirukkanichuram obviuosly named after the emperoer Khan and it is <br />quite<br />interesting to note in this connection that in Quanzhou there are <br />still many<br />pieces of stone sculptures and pillars with carved designs which <br />represent<br />Hindu religion. The sculptures and pillars remaining in a Buddhist <br />temple<br />called the kaiyuansi were studied by A K KUmaraswamy but since 1950 <br />many more<br />pieces have been excavated. These Hindu sculptures and pillars <br />indicate that<br />there was once a fairly big Hindu temple in Quanzhou. It has been <br />suggested by<br />a<br />Chineses scholar that a Hindu temple called the Fanfosi was <br />constructed by a<br />son-in-law of Pu Shougeng a famous muslim high official living in <br />Quanzhou<br />during the thirteenth century. But the Tamil inscription mentioned <br />above may<br />explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was <br />established in<br />Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil <br />inscription<br />reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure indication <br />that there<br />was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during the <br />thirteenth<br />century"<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, singanallur ramaswamy <br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> we come across names such as Sawagam, Mabappalam, <br />Mayuridingam, Ilamuri Desam.<br />  Where are these in Malaysia/Singapore/Thail;and/cambodia?<br />  <br />  <br />  To:  ponniyinselvan@...: sps10142004@...: Mon, 21 May 2007 09:26:37 <br />+0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: lost city believed to be found -</div></blockquote>it is said to be raided by rajendra chola 1025<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vj_episteme" <br /> wrote:PLS REFER RELATED DISCUSSIONS :: Chola empire</div></blockquote>conference at Univ. of California, Berkeley--------------------------<br />--------------------------------The Chola Empire---------------------<br />-----"The Cholas came to power in the late 9th century, and until <br />the late 13th century, they ruled most of South India, Sri Lanka, <br />the Maldive Islands, and even parts of the Indonesian island of Java <br />from their homeland near Thanjavur (Tanjore) on the southeastern <br />coast of what is now Tamil Nadu, India. It was founded by Vijalaya, <br />who captured Tanjore in 850 AD. The greatest among the Chola rulers <br />were the imperialists Rajaraja (985-1014 AD) and his son Rajendra I <br />(1012 1044 AD). These rulers adopted a maritime policy allowing <br />their expansionist arm to reach far longer than pure land expansion <br />would allow, Maldives and Sri Lanka. Under Rajaraja the Chola <br />kingdom grew into an extensive and well knit empire.

Kedah <br />has a wealth of ancient temple structures in the world famous Bujang <br />Valley. Apart from Kadaram, there was also the Kingdom of Gangga <br />Nagaram that lies in ruins today further down south after <br />destruction by King Raja Rajendra.There is yet another forgotten <br />thousand year old city of Kota Gelanggi, raided by the same King, <br />far down South, in the state of Johor. Its ruins in thick jungle <br />have been established via aerial photos and a ground level <br />expedition is being planned.The discovery of this place hit the <br />headlines of today's The Star newspaper, the major English in <br />Malaysia.This is the single most exciting news on the ancient <br />history of Malaysia apart from the Bujang <br />Valley.=======================sps wrote ::I was looking at the net <br />for the information.

Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The <br />ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-date <br />Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as Candi <br />Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the belief <br />of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga <br />sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the <br />Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square kilometre <br />site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek and <br />Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of research on <br />Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota Gelanggi <br />can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite <br />structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some scholars <br />believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first centre <br />of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city was <br />later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the <br />Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the unidentified <br />12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror <br />Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025.    On <br />April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service (Bernama)   <br />reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to   <br />have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a thousand   <br />years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in the   <br />National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of <br />archaeology in the department's   research and development division, <br />said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in <br />July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".    Note <br />that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi   caves <br />near Jerantut in Pahang.  <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>_________________________________________________________________<br />  Want to look great?

But the Tamil inscription mentioned <br />  above may<br />  explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was <br />  established in<br />  Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil <br />  inscription<br />  reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure indication <br />  that there<br />  was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during the <br />  thirteenth<br />  century"<br />  <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, singanallur ramaswamy <br />   wrote:<br />   <br />    <br />    In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> we come across names such as Sawagam, Mabappalam, <br />  Mayuridingam, Ilamuri Desam.<br />    Where are these in Malaysia/Singapore/Thail;and/cambodia?<br />    <br />    <br />    To:  ponniyinselvan@: sps10142004@: Mon, 21 May 2007 09:26:37 <br />  +0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: lost city believed to be found -<br /> <br />  it is said to be raided by rajendra chola 1025<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vj_episteme" <br />   wrote:PLS REFER RELATED DISCUSSIONS :: Chola empire <br />  conference at Univ. of California, Berkeley------------------------<br />--<br />  --------------------------------The Chola Empire-------------------<br />--<br />  -----"The Cholas came to power in the late 9th century, and until <br />  the late 13th century, they ruled most of South India, Sri Lanka, <br />  the Maldive Islands, and even parts of the Indonesian island of <br />Java <br />  from their homeland near Thanjavur &#40;Tanjore&#41; on the southeastern <br />  coast of what is now Tamil Nadu, India.

Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The <br />  ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-date <br />  Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as Candi <br />  Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the belief <br />  of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga <br />  sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the <br />  Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square <br />kilometre <br />  site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek <br />and <br />  Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of research <br />on <br />  Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota Gelanggi <br />  can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite <br />  structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some scholars <br />  believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first <br />centre <br />  of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city <br />was <br />  later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the <br />  Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the <br />unidentified <br />  12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror <br />  Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025.    <br />On <br />  April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service &#40;Bernama&#41;   <br />  reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to   <br />  have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a thousand <br />  <br />  years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in the <br />  <br />  National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of <br />  archaeology in the department&#39;s   research and development <br />division, <br />  said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in <br />  July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".    Note <br />  that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi   <br />caves <br />  near Jerantut in Pahang.  <br />    <br />    <br />    _________________________________________________________________<br />    Want to look great?

Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The <br />    ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-<br />date <br />    Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as <br />Candi <br />    Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the <br />belief <br />    of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga <br />    sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the <br />    Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square <br />  kilometre <br />    site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek <br />  and <br />    Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of <br />research <br />  on <br />    Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota <br />Gelanggi <br />    can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite <br />    structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some <br />scholars <br />    believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first <br />  centre <br />    of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city <br />  was <br />    later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the <br />    Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the <br />  unidentified <br />    12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror <br />    Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025.  <br />  <br />  On <br />    April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service &#40;Bernama&#41;   <br />    reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to <br />  <br />    have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a <br />thousand <br />    <br />    years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in <br />the <br />    <br />    National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of <br />    archaeology in the department&#39;s   research and development <br />  division, <br />    said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in <br />    July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".    <br />Note <br />    that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi   <br />  caves <br />    near Jerantut in Pahang.  <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />_________________________________________________________________<br />      Want to look great?

The <br />installation <br />  of <br />      Siva idol<br />      may well be taken for the establishment of a Siva temple which <br />  is <br />      called as<br />      Thirukkanichuram obviuosly named after the emperoer Khan and <br />it <br />  is <br />      quite<br />      interesting to note in this connection that in Quanzhou there <br />  are <br />      still many<br />      pieces of stone sculptures and pillars with carved designs <br />which <br />      represent<br />      Hindu religion. The sculptures and pillars remaining in a <br />  Buddhist <br />      temple<br />      called the kaiyuansi were studied by A K KUmaraswamy but since <br />    1950 <br />      many more<br />      pieces have been excavated. These Hindu sculptures and pillars <br />      indicate that<br />      there was once a fairly big Hindu temple in Quanzhou. It has <br />  been <br />      suggested by<br />      a<br />      Chineses scholar that a Hindu temple called the Fanfosi was <br />      constructed by a<br />      son-in-law of Pu Shougeng a famous muslim high official living <br />  in <br />      Quanzhou<br />      during the thirteenth century. But the Tamil inscription <br />  mentioned <br />      above may<br />      explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was <br />      established in<br />      Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil <br />      inscription<br />      reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure <br />  indication <br />      that there<br />      was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during <br />the <br />      thirteenth<br />      century"<br />      <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, singanallur ramaswamy <br />       wrote:<br />       <br />        <br />        In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> we come across names such as Sawagam, Mabappalam, <br />      Mayuridingam, Ilamuri Desam.<br />        Where are these in Malaysia/Singapore/Thail;and/cambodia?<br />        <br />        <br />        To:  ponniyinselvan@: sps10142004@: Mon, 21 May 2007 09:26:37 <br />      +0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: lost city believed to be <br />  found -<br />     <br />      it is said to be raided by rajendra chola 1025<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vj_episteme" <br />       wrote:PLS REFER RELATED DISCUSSIONS :: Chola <br />  empire <br />      conference at Univ. of California, Berkeley--------------------<br />--<br />  --<br />    --<br />      --------------------------------The Chola Empire---------------<br />--<br />  --<br />    --<br />      -----"The Cholas came to power in the late 9th century, and <br />  until <br />      the late 13th century, they ruled most of South India, Sri <br />  Lanka, <br />      the Maldive Islands, and even parts of the Indonesian island <br />of <br />    Java <br />      from their homeland near Thanjavur &#40;Tanjore&#41; on the <br />southeastern <br />      coast of what is now Tamil Nadu, India.

The installation<br />  of<br />      Siva idol<br />      may well be taken for the establishment of a Siva temple which<br />  is<br />      called as<br />      Thirukkanichuram obviuosly named after the emperoer Khan and it<br />  is<br />      quite<br />      interesting to note in this connection that in Quanzhou there<br />  are<br />      still many<br />      pieces of stone sculptures and pillars with carved designs which<br />      represent<br />      Hindu religion. The sculptures and pillars remaining in a<br />  Buddhist<br />      temple<br />      called the kaiyuansi were studied by A K KUmaraswamy but since<br />    1950<br />      many more<br />      pieces have been excavated. These Hindu sculptures and pillars<br />      indicate that<br />      there was once a fairly big Hindu temple in Quanzhou. It has<br />  been<br />      suggested by<br />      a<br />      Chineses scholar that a Hindu temple called the Fanfosi was<br />      constructed by a<br />      son-in-law of Pu Shougeng a famous muslim high official living<br />  in<br />      Quanzhou<br />      during the thirteenth century. But the Tamil inscription<br />  mentioned<br />      above may<br />      explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was<br />      established in<br />      Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil<br />      inscription<br />      reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure<br />  indication<br />      that there<br />      was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during the<br />      thirteenth<br />      century"<br />     <br />      --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  singanallur ramaswamy<br />       wrote:<br />       <br />       <br />        In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> we come across names such as Sawagam, Mabappalam,<br />      Mayuridingam, Ilamuri Desam.<br />        Where are these in Malaysia/Singapore/Thail;and/cambodia?<br />       <br />       <br />        To:  ponniyinselvan@: sps10142004@: Mon, 21 May 2007 09:26:37<br />      +0000Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: lost city believed to be<br />  found -<br />   <br />      it is said to be raided by rajendra chola 1025<br />       <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />        --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,<br />  "vj_episteme"<br />       wrote:PLS REFER RELATED DISCUSSIONS :: Chola<br />  empire<br />      conference at Univ. of California, Berkeley----------------------<br />  --<br />    --<br />      --------------------------------The Chola Empire-----------------<br />  --<br />    --<br />      -----"The Cholas came to power in the late 9th century, and<br />  until<br />      the late 13th century, they ruled most of South India, Sri<br />  Lanka,<br />      the Maldive Islands, and even parts of the Indonesian island of<br />    Java<br />      from their homeland near Thanjavur &#40;Tanjore&#41; on the southeastern<br />      coast of what is now Tamil Nadu, India.

Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The<br />      ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-<br />  date<br />      Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as<br />  Candi<br />      Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the<br />  belief<br />      of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga<br />      sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the<br />      Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square<br />    kilometre<br />      site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek<br />    and<br />      Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of<br />  research<br />    on<br />      Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota<br />  Gelanggi<br />      can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite<br />      structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some<br />  scholars<br />      believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first<br />    centre<br />      of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city<br />    was<br />      later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the<br />      Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the<br />    unidentified<br />      12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror<br />      Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025. <br />   <br />    On<br />      April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service &#40;Bernama&#41;  <br />      reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to<br />   <br />      have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a<br />  thousand<br />     <br />      years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in<br />  the<br />     <br />      National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of<br />      archaeology in the department&#39;s   research and development<br />    division,<br />      said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in<br />      July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".   <br />  Note<br />      that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi  <br />    caves<br />      near Jerantut in Pahang. <br />       <br />       <br />       <br />  __________________________________________________________<br />        Want to look great?
