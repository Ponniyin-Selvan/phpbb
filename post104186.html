But of late I am getting a<br /><acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> hesitant..<br /><br />It's sheer hypocrisy to call the "RSS" as communal and the "Muslim<br />league" as secular. By trying to blame everything on RSS, we're<br />missing a bigger picture. India is and will be secular because the<br />majority are Hindus and I'm very happy for that and would like that to<br />remain the same...<br /><br />We should at the same time be concerned about the activities of<br />entities like the Saudi funded "tableegi jammat" etc.. that tries to<br />destroy the local culture and "arabise" every muslim. You can see that<br />from the names and the dresses they wear etc..<br /><br />So after all the terrorist incidents, I thought of learning somethings<br />about islam and its supposed intolerance and find out if the<br />allegations are really true.. I don't have many friends from the<br />religion, but I have a few and they can hardly be classified as liberals..<br /><br />If you have time, read this website from a department of an university<br />in US that contains the authentic translations of Quran into english<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/quranindex.html">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/quranindex.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Particularly the treatment of kafirs / slaves / women etc..

			<div class="content">Over nightla evvalavu mailaaa.......good debate. Welcome back priya,<br />again with your punch.<br /><br />All, I think no one read my mail and understood what I meant, esp.<br />Veena. If my words gave a different meaning I plead apology. But I<br />request you to go through it again. I never supported or said RSS/VHP<br />thier voilence are correct. I only said, dont just take one incident<br />of babri masjid, see alse the service they render to the society. I<br />think this point is lost in the ether.<br /><br />Veena, during Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo's worked. But the first<br />to reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total<br />effort. thats what I stressed. When you criticise them, you should<br />also appreciate them for their good, if at all you are really<br />neutral.But all the media highlighted all NGOs but not RSS. Is this<br />democracy? Is this secularism? Thats what I tried to pointed out, but<br />you see only in your view, stamping them to be extremists.<br /><br />I think Samptha, Priya, and others have given valuable points,which I<br />need not ponder again. I wrote this earlier, but since veena pointed<br />out the burining of people on the streets of gujarat, I say this.<br />Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org.<br />reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena, why<br />you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about the<br />hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or rather<br />anti-BJP talks. Its Gujrat communal clash, not a genocide. Communal<br />clash means both communities suffer. If muslims weer burnt on the<br />street, hindus should also would have burned on the streets. Its only<br />that the mediat didnt publish it and published anti-hindu news alone.<br />You are learned, try to think logically. If 2000 people die in a<br />communal class, 50% on each side means 1000 hindus also died. simple<br />arithmatic, right? Btw, I am not supporting what the Hindus did, nor<br />support violence. I am just questioning, why you people talk only<br />anti-hindu and are not neutral, why you dont condemn godhra<br />carnage,but only condemn hindu acts alone...you need not answer me<br />nor I expect an answer. Please try to answer yourSELF.<br /><br />Veena, actually I wrote the words like, you have all the<br />qualifications to become a politician, and then thought it might hurt<br />you and erased it. But I fell laughing when you said I have all the<br />qualification to be a RSS person. Thanks for the compliment and in<br />your words, I feel proud to get such a complement.If you have read my<br />last words of the mail, I clearly stated that the Hindu org never<br />asked others to quit, but only pleading for the peaceful<br />cooexistence. When its denied, as sampath stated, they emotionally<br />turn to violence.<br /><br />Dear Sri, your points are valid. I have never read the manusmrithi<br />and so cant comment on it. But my feeling is if such bad things are<br />there in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism would have swept away<br />Hinduism. You yourself said, inspite of all invasion,culture or<br />imperial, Hinduism survived. If many bad things were there, how come<br />it survived. I feel its the misinterpretation of facts. Probably I am<br />wrong, but I live it to you to think. If Hinduism is so bad, how come<br />its surviving from time immemorial. Suppression will alwasy lead to<br />revolution. Frech Revolution, Boston Tea party, breaking of the USSR<br />etc. etc. We dont have any such instances in our country. If people<br />were suppressed in the name of caste(I do accept there might be stray<br />instances but we should not brand with stray instances)surely they<br />should have revolted long back.Just give a thought.I am trying to<br />thing logically. If you compress a baloon it will surely burst. Why<br />didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?<br /><br />Supreme court has given judgement sometime back that only minorities<br />can open institutions.Whats wrong in admitting only FC in an<br />institution, if all other religion and other castes have their own<br />institution. I am hearing this for the first time. Where will the<br />FC's go if they cant get admission in the name of reservation? Why<br />dont you point out that minority institutions admit only minorities.<br />Dont say they also admit Hindus, it will happen only if you have high<br />recomendation. I studied in Loyola college chennai and I know their<br />admission procedure. If you had said that all institutions should<br />admit based on merit or the govt. prescribed reservation policy I<br />would have been happy. But pointing out one institution which admits<br />FCs, when the country is flooded with 1000s of minority institutions<br />and jathi based instititutions admitting their clan, your point<br />looses its base.<br /><br />Re. Christian institutions converting. I appreciate the western<br />countries and the missionaries a lot. They are great strategists.<br />They are not aiming and immediate conversion. They have a 100 or 1000<br />year plan, which started 300 years back. They started by slowing<br />getting involved in social activities, setting up schools, colleges<br />etc.by which they can infiltrate the society. Today celebrating<br />birthdays by cutting cakes (I think we Hindus only go by natchatiram<br />and not by date..), celebrating christmas, new year, valentines<br />day,mothers day, fathers day, etc etc. the influence of christian<br />life style. Though we had all these in our culture itself, we adopted<br />western culture. Without our knowledge we lost our culture. Once<br />culture is lost, its easy to break the religion. Well planned, well<br />executed converson strategy, which is still going on. But on the<br />outset we cant find it out. I am sure you will criticize me for this<br />saying I am going nuts thinking crazy, but I seriously think in this<br />angle, which is agreat threat to our society. So we cant blindly<br />say, christians run schools just for the societies cause.It has its<br />own internal agenda. Why should a school have a church inside? every<br />christian school will have a church and you should be knowing it. If<br />only education is their motto why church inside the premisis?<br /><br />I am wondering, if in such a small group itself, talking in favour of<br />Hindus is fanatism what about at the country level...my god..<br /><br />Such debates can never end, and no one cn change others opinions. But<br />being humans we should be able to correct oursleves, by retrospecting<br />and knowing what is right and what is wrong. Let it be you or me...we<br />should not just go by the band wagon effect.If my views are wrong I<br />am alwasy ready to change.......<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish</div>

			<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />For the past two-three days, there has been a lot of mails flying as to who is correct and who is wrong, not from a historical perspective, but more from a society and communal perspective.<br /><br />If I sound a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> harsh, please do excuse me...I do not intend to show any disrespect or insult anybody here...<br /><br />But in this discussion, are we not forgetting the primary purpose for which this group has been created? Has not this group been created for trying to understand our history and the beauty of our great nation? Why then, my friends this amount of mudslinging? So what if people came from abroad and tried to dominate or rule us? Have'nt we over come them with the most powerful weapon...that of love? Are we here to discuss who is greater...the Hindu, the Muslim or the Christian? Or are we here to discuss the beautiful history that all of them have left us with?<br /><br />Each and every one of you have mentioned points that are valid....but again from whose points of view? Are'nt all of us here Indians? So, why forget the primary objective of this group and argue about something that is not related to the focus of this group here. Let us all concentrate on learning from each other as we have been for the past so many days.....PLEASE I BEG YOU...!!!!<br /><br />Last but not the least, I would like share with you all, something I read from the Agathiyar group......<br /><br />If we reduce the population of the Earth to a small town with 100 people<br />and keep the proportions, it will look like this:<br /><br />57 Asians 21 Europeans 14 Americans (northern and southern) 8 Africans<br /><br />52 women 48 men<br /><br />70 coloured-skins 30 caucasians<br /><br />6 people would own 59% of the whole world wealth and all of them will be<br />from the United States of America<br /><br />80 would have bad living conditions<br />70 will be uneducated<br />50 will be underfed<br />1 would die<br />2 would be born<br />1 will have a computer<br />1 (only one) will have higher education<br /><br />If you look at the world from this point of view, you will see how there is<br />a big need of solidarity, understanding, patience and education.<br /><br />Also think about the following:<br />If this morning you've woke up healthy, you are happier then 1 million<br />people that will not survive next week.<br /><br /><br />If you never suffered a war, the loneliness of the jail cell, the agony of<br />torture, or hunger,<br /><br />you are happier than 500 million people in the world.<br />If you can enter into a church (mosque) without fear of jail or death, you<br />are happier than 3 million people in the world.<br /><br /><br />If there is a food in your fridge, you have shoes and clothes, you have<br />bed and a roof, you are richer than 75% of the people in the world.<br /><br />If you have bank account, money in your wallet and some coins in the<br />money-box, you belong to the 8% of the people on the world, which are<br />well-to-do.<br /><br />If you read this you are three times more blessed because:<br /><br />1. somebody just thought of you.<br />2. you don't belong to the 200 million people that cannot read.<br />3. and... you have a computer!<br /><br />As somebody once said:<br /><br />- work as if you don't need money,<br />- love as if nobody had ever hurt you,<br />- dance, as if nobody can see you, sing, as if nobody can hear you,<br />- live, as if the Earth was a heaven."<br /><br />So let us all remember that there is no weapon on earth that can defeat the power of LOVE...!!!<br /><br />I again apologise if any of you here felt insulted or hurt by this message....!It was unintentional..!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Sriraman<br /><br />Yahoo! India Matrimony: Find your life partneronline.</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Sriraman,<br /><br />No one will take your words wrong. Dont worry. Hope you know that our<br />group is used to such debates (Fights? -:) )<br /><br />LOVE - live and let live. If I dont live, i cant love. Hope you will<br />agree with this. Your words are fantastic. And India is the<br />janmaboomi for everything, you name it, we have it. Sanathana dharma<br />has everything which you say -love, affection, non violence etc. etc.<br /><br />Today in India, we dont have communal harmony. In Kashmir 4 million<br />Hindu pundits have been pushed out of their home land, who have lost<br />everything, whatever you mentioned as gifts for people like us. In<br />Pak and Bangladesh the 10% Hindu population during Independence is<br />pushed down to mere 0.5% today. Anywhere in the world if<br />terrorism/Violence spurts, 95% its because of Muslims. Hindus are<br />denied thier basic rights. Whenever VHP or Hindu org. conduct even a<br />religious gathering, trucks of police are piled up there. One of my<br />friends said, a few days back when VHP conduted a vilakku pujai in a<br />temple in Pallavaram, two trucks of Police were pilied outside the<br />temple and several plain clothes police mixed with the public inside<br />the temple. Its not a meeting or any other protest. Just a vilakku<br />poojai. Can this happen to a church or a mosque when they are<br />praying? Can police enter a church or mosque as they entered into<br />Kanchi mutt? If it happens the whole country will burn in flames.<br />Are the Hindus getting the same rights as that of the minorities. As<br />a Hindu I am not even free to pray in this land and how can you<br />expect me to love others?<br /><br />Hope you heard the controversy regarding the movie called "SINS".<br />There is a heu and cry before the movie was released. Christians<br />protested against the movie even though its said to be a true story<br />happened in Kerala. Just inone movie if a christian father is shown<br />in a wrong way, all christians protest. But showing Hindu sanyasis in<br />a wrong way is a part and parcel of movies. As priya said 1000s of<br />fathers across the world are prosecuted and fined for sexual abuse.<br />Today christian machinaries in the US and Canada are bankrupt and<br />dont have funds to convert in Asia, becuase they are paying huge sums<br />as compensation. But no one talks about it. If someone talks as<br />in "SINS" its revolted. But disgracing Hindus are not of concern to<br />anyone.If I say all this and talk for the Hindus, 1000s of Veenas and<br />Sridhars will protest saying I am fanatic.(sorry I dont mean to hurt<br />anyone. I am just citing examples).They will quote stray instance of<br />Babri masjid forgeting the service done by RSS through out the<br />country or premananda forgetting Ramana maharishi, vivekananda,<br />Arbindo,of the past of Dayanand saraswathi, Chinmayananda,<br />Sukhabodananda, Sudbavananda etc of the present.<br /><br />Why dont you preach this LOVE to those fanatics. I mean the anti-<br />Hindu, Christian and Muslim fanatics. If people who are concerned<br />about Hindus life talks in favour of them, then they are fanatics (as<br />Sampath, Priya, me are branded hahaha...) and everyone points finger<br />and preches love.<br /><br />We are ready to love....pathiramarindhu pitchai edu....are the others<br />worthy for our Love...please answer....I am not a gnani to give<br />unconditional love irrespective of the opponent(I mean the christians<br />and muslims). If I can love unconditionally, i wont be participating<br />in such discussion. Why so far, i would not be using computer at all.<br />I will be happily sitting in Himalays or Tiruvannamalai, with just<br />one kovanam(or probably even without that, as thats what mutrum<br />thurandh munivar means. Like Ramana maharishi et al) and will be<br />smiling at this filthy world.I am trying to be one, but I have to<br />cross this samsara sagaram, right...till then I will be Human...<br /><br />Even if we are ready to love others, christians and muslims say they<br />wont accept the love unless we get converted. Have you ever heard of<br />a Muslim/Christian boy/girl converting(or rather following the Hindu<br />way of life) when they love and marry a Hindu girl/boy? its only the<br />Hindu let it be boy or girl who should convert to thier religion when<br />they love and get married.<br /><br />Re. your point on our groups purpose. yes I totally agree with you.<br />We are trying to bring the true history. Whatever I am saying is also<br />history. Why dont we talk about the history of Muslims killing the<br />Hindus? Should we talk only about History which is good and has a<br />happy Ending? We are not shooting movies to have happy endings. If<br />Uttama' conspiring to Kill Aditya is history,<br />Muslims/christians/Marxists/letists/congress conspiring to kill<br />Hinduism is also history. If we are not ready to talk about history<br />which is not pleasing to us, then whats the difference between the so<br />called "SECULARISTS", the marxists who never accepts the greatness of<br />India, and us. If we should not talk about history which is<br />unpleasant to us, then the historians are right in thier own sense to<br />deviate from the original history and publish the history which we<br />read today, because they would have felt the original history<br />unpleasant. If thats the case, then the true history, which we try to<br />uncover will never come out.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>So let us all remember that there is no weapon on earth that can<br />defeat the power of LOVE...!!!<br /> <br />  I again apologise if any of you here felt insulted or hurt by this<br />message....!It was unintentional..!<br /> <br />  Regards,<br /> <br />  Sriraman<br /> <br />  Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Mr.Sathish,<br />One thing that all of us here need to understand clearly...the very basic of life is love.<br />True...it is not possible to be as great as a Ramana Maharishi or any one.<br />The very essence of our Vedas is that beautiful thing called love.<br />All of us have to understand one thing....HINDUISM IS NOT A RELIGION...IT IS A WAY OF LIFE....!!!!!<br />IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY TO BE A CHRISTIAN,MUSLIM OR ANYTHING ELSE...WITHOUT BEING A HINDU IN SPIRIT....!!!!<br />I am not out to brand anyone a fanatic or anti-secular or anything.<br />The freedom of life that our Vedas has given is not given in anyother religion!<br />Another fact...castiesm is not a result of the Vedas..!!The Vedas and Upanishads only define how a man who follows a particular career is to be identified.<br />Just like the current day bigots are doing, there must have been any number of narrow-minded bigots who made it generation-based....<br />And who is it that says that Shudra is an untouchable...?!<br />The word "SHUDRA" is nothing but an anagram of SHUDDA+RUDRA+BHAKTHA....this is the explanation given in one of the commentries on the VEDAS by Vyasa or somebody..I do not recall correctly...<br />But my whole point in my previous point is....why any unneccassary such squabbles amongst us? Why can't we prove that it is possible even for people in the Samsaara Saagara, as you so aptly phrased it, can love unconditionally, with all the difference of opinions amongst us?<br />Violence, as one of us has so aptly mentioned, does not help us in this my friend.<br />Why can't we set an example to the masses who are being mislead?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sriraman<br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Sriraman,<br /><br />No one will take your words wrong.
