			<div class="content">MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE IN SOUTH INDIA<br /><br />Merchant associations or guilds were features common to many medieval <br />economies.<br /><br />The major Asian trade boom of the tenth to thirteenth centuries <br />appears to have stimulated a significant restructuring of the <br />administration of trade in most major economies of Asia, North Africa <br />and Europe. <br /><br />The Middle Eastern commenda-type investment contract (qirad, etc.), <br />which had become such an important tool of commercial activity in the <br />Middle East by the tenth century, was introduced into Italian <br />seaports by the early eleventh century, thus providing a major <br />impetus for the expansion of trade in medieval Europe.<br /><br />(1) In China, the hang developed from a trading quarter into a nearly <br />autonomous trade association, and the organization of collective <br />financing and management of overseas shipping ventures became <br />increasingly complex.(2) And in southern India a series of merchant <br />associations developed powerful networks and vertical monopolies that <br />included not only tied manufacturers but also private armies. These <br />associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.<br /><br />Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more <br />dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the locus <br />of large agrarian states. For much of the region's history, power was <br />fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states with <br />different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast (Coromandel <br />or Cholamandala) coast; Malayalam along the southwest (Malabar) <br />coast; Telegu on the eastern (Andhra) coast north of the Tamil <br />heartland; and Kanarese on the western (now Konkan) coast to the <br />north of the Malabar region. Many of these states relied upon <br />overseas trade to enhance their limited agricultural income. The <br />Pallavas were the first Tamil rulers of real consequence. <br /><br />They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, <br />and their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the <br />early Hindu remains of the maritime region.<br /><br />Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by <br />the later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power <br />in the southeast by the Cholas. <br /><br />The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the <br />Pallavas, and expanded their links with merchant associations.<br /><br />Much of southern India's sea trade during the late first and early <br />second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the <br />most important of which appear to have first formed in southwest <br />India.<br /><br /><br />During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India's <br />trade had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, <br />Jewish, Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia <br />and the Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar <br />coast. <br /><br /><br />It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian <br />merchant associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the <br />earliest of the south Indian merchant associations to appear in local <br />records, was mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam (Sthanu <br />Ravi) copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar <br />coast. These record a contract between the local authority and a <br />group of resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them <br />access, free of certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port <br />market, apparently operated by the merchant group.(3) This merchant <br />association appears to have extended its influence to the east coast <br />shortly afterwards, probably with political encouragement, since the <br />Pallava rulers of the southeast had maintained close relations with <br />the Chera state of the Malabar coast.<br /><br />During the same period another merchant association had begun to form <br />further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole (called <br />Ayyavole in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit) in the Chalukya <br />heartland behind the Konkan coast.(4) They were known either as the <br />Ayyavole/Aryapura association (after their eighth or ninth century <br />place of origin), or more generally as the Ainnurruvar ("The Five <br />Hundred"). This group rapidly became the most powerful of the <br />merchant associations. A number of other merchant groups are known to <br />have affiliated themselves with the Ayyavole, those most prominent in <br />sea trade being the Manigramam and the Nanadesi. In addition, at its <br />height, the Ayyavole appears to have occupied a dominant position in <br />relation to at least forty-six other professional bodies, including <br />major associations of artisans and mercenaries.(5)<br /><br />The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain <br />crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium, <br />under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that <br />were experienced in India included such developments in the weaving <br />and dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh <br />century - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the <br />thirteenth century.(6) Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with <br />indigo or mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large <br />quantities to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the <br />thirteenth century.(7) On the back of this expanding manufacturing <br />and trading base, merchant groups gained a large degree of control <br />over the non-agrarian economy in southern India, assuming the role of <br />major patrons of religious establishments, and being drawn into the <br />collection of certain tolls and taxes on behalf of the state.(8)<br /><br />Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the <br />internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka <br />from the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The <br />general Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was <br />vanigrama ("community of merchants"), and more than one association <br />appears to have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants mentioned <br />in a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,(9) and the term Manigramam <br />was a local variant.<br /><br />The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the end <br />of the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline <br />accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the <br />Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu carved <br />up the Chola territory.(10) Zhao Rugua (Chau Ju-kua), writing in the <br />port of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state <br />was at war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several <br />states on the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a <br />number of states on the east coast of India - an active exporter of <br />cotton textiles.(11) This impression of changing fortunes is <br />reinforced by the three early thirteenth century hoards of Chinese <br />coins found on the coast of Tamil Nadu,(12) which were probably <br />abandoned by the mid-thirteenth century due to local upheavals. The <br />mid-thirteenth century efforts of the Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to <br />revive trade in the southeast Indian port of Motupalli by promising <br />greater safety and stability reflect the growing turbulence in the <br />region.(13)<br /><br />The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into the <br />fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade <br />continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and <br />integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were <br />issuing fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these <br />associations continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either <br />their structures and modes of operation were changing, or their <br />economic and political power were declining. Despite these changes, <br />individual traders on India's coasts continued to export the cotton <br />textiles and dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the <br />Middle East and in maritime Southeast Asia.<br /><br />SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES<br /><br />South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend <br />their activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite <br />their apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai <br />peninsula (see below), the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole <br />and the Manigramam seems to have been the western sector of the <br />Indian Ocean and the Middle East. By the tenth century, however, the <br />Asian sea trade boom had begun to draw more East and Southeast Asian <br />trade into the Indian Ocean. <br /><br />The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations <br />spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior <br />and to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern <br />Kalinga, the Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,(14) largely <br />under the auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations <br />remained powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, <br />but lost ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of <br />that century.<br /><br />The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in <br />Southeast Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, <br />probably because of the strength of competing local vested interests <br />in trade. It is also important to note that not all South Asians <br />trading in maritime Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom <br />were clearly associated with South Indian merchant groups. <br /><br />Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a clear <br />picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and <br />Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this <br />period suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in <br />large enough numbers to be classified by region. <br /><br />These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama (the <br />Javanized version of vanigrama) was used in Javanese and Balinese <br />port texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather <br />fluid, port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign <br />merchants, some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from <br />local rulers.<br /><br />Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about <br />overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of <br />the lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to <br />reflect changing patterns of trade.(15) The earliest dated original <br />inscription to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan(16) from <br />Kedu in central Java, dated 883 A.D. <br /><br />The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland <br />Southeast Asians from Campa (Champa), Remman (Ramanyadesa, in Mon <br />Lower Burma), and Kmira (Cambodia); the listed South Asians came from <br />Kling (Kalinga), Aryya (Aryapura/Ayyavole), Pandikira (in Kamataka), <br />and perhaps Singhala (Sri Lanka) - although this last reading is <br />uncertain. The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth <br />century to contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of <br />927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river <br />near Madiun(17) - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.<br /><br />The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been <br />preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not <br />changed markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan <br />inscription. The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and <br />early tenth centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east <br />coast districts of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and <br />southern Orissa, or from the western Konkan coastal region already <br />dominated by the Ayyavole merchant association. These three regions <br />remained a constant in the Javanese lists from the ninth to the <br />fourteenth century. <br /><br />The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga - <br />appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early <br />date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil <br />It was perhaps because of the region's dominance of the early textile <br />exports to Southeast Asia that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in <br />the Indonesian archipelago as a blanket-term covering all South <br />Asians, and in some cases all foreigners from the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant <br />associations from the west coast of southern India towards the east, <br />stimulated by increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was <br />accompanied by a broadening of the range of commodities traded. South <br />Indian trade with the Middle East had been dominated by such exports <br />as black pepper, areca nuts and iron.<br /><br />(18) Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth <br />century and may have played an important role in trade with such <br />Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own <br />iron sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association <br />activities to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton-<br />producing region stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through <br />Karnataka to the southern coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to <br />gain more prominence in the list of exports.<br /><br />Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of <br />the later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in <br />popularity of Indian export cloths at this time.(19) Four original <br />Javanese inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the <br />eleventh century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. <br /><br /><br />The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,(20) from the Brantas delta region <br />of east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, <br />Pandikira, Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of <br />Patakan,(21) from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was <br />commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. <br /><br /><br />The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast <br />Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the <br />Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power <br />within southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then <br />extended their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives <br />by the first decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined <br />the merchants operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast <br />Asia. The Chola state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major <br />player in the eastern sector of the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among <br />Indian exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />(22) Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese statuary <br />reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />printed Indian export textiles during this period.(23) By the 1040s <br />and 1050s, when the Turun Hyang(24) and Garaman(25) inscriptions were <br />written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in <br />the lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika (Chola), and Pandikira <br />by Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the <br />list the name Malyala (the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar <br />coast).<br /><br />By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South <br />Asian regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably <br />operating from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well <br />have been members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant <br />associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to <br />have been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather <br />than as representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as <br />tax farmers in east Java.<br /><br />They appear to have operated on the same footing as local merchants <br />or those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.(26)<br /><br />There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of <br />inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of <br />the eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and <br />the end of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the <br />division of Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of <br />Janggala, though active in trade, left few records on permanent <br />materials - unlike its sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. <br /><br /><br />The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves <br />of former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until <br />the Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent <br />materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier <br />charters. <br /><br />The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.(27) is the only original <br />Majapahit inscription found to date that contains a list of tax-<br />farming foreigners. The list reads as follows:<br /><br />"...wargga kilalan (tax-farmer group): Kling, Aryya, [.....], <br />Singhala, Karnataka, [.....], Cina (China), Campa (Champa), Mandisi <br />(?), Caremin (Ramanyadesa), Kmir (Cambodia),..."<br /><br />The significant addition found in this list is China, whose merchants <br />had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially-<br />pressed Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and <br />wait for it to arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders <br />appear to have begun to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just <br />as Chinese-style currency had already begun to displace the earlier <br />forms of indigenous currency in Java and Bali.(28) During the Mongol <br />period at least some of these Chinese merchants may have felt more <br />comfortable operating from non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the <br />regions of India represented in the legible portion of the Balawi <br />list were those that had been there from the ninth century onwards - <br />the east-coast regions of Andhra Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west-<br />coast Aryapura/Ayyavole heartland of the dominant (though now fading) <br />merchant association. The decline of the Chola empire and the partial <br />disruption of trade in eastern waters during the late thirteenth and <br />early fourteenth centuries clearly had not led to an abandoning of <br />trade links between Indian ports and those of maritime Southeast Asia.<br /><br />The Nagarakertagama,(29) a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D., <br />mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast <br />Asia, and Jambudwipa (India) - specifically from Goda (Gaur in <br />Bengal) and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away <br />from the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance <br />of the Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese <br />lists of Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile <br />trade. Patterned textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth-<br />century statuary from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some <br />of the patterns preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of <br />those centuries found at Egyptian sites.(30) Although some of the <br />patterns on Javanese statuary may represent local batik copies of <br />Indian export cloths, there is no doubt that Indian printed cottons <br />were hugely popular all around the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by <br />this time. Even during this century of relative trade depression in <br />parts of maritime Southeast Asia, India's cottons found a ready <br />market.</div>

These<br />associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.<br /><br />Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more<br />dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the locus of<br />large agrarian states. For much of the region's history, power was<br />fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states with<br />different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast (Coromandel or<br />Cholamandala) coast; Malayalam along the southwest (Malabar) coast;<br />Telegu on the eastern (Andhra) coast north of the Tamil heartland; and<br />Kanarese on the western (now Konkan) coast to the north of the Malabar<br />region. Many of these states relied upon overseas trade to enhance their<br />limited agricultural income. The Pallavas were the first Tamil rulers of<br />real consequence. <br /><br />They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, and<br />their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the early<br />Hindu remains of the maritime region.<br /><br />Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by the<br />later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power in the<br />southeast by the Cholas. <br /><br />The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the Pallavas,<br />and expanded their links with merchant associations.<br /><br />Much of southern India's sea trade during the late first and early<br />second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the most<br />important of which appear to have first formed in southwest India.<br /><br /><br />During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India's trade<br />had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, Jewish,<br />Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia and the<br />Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar coast. <br /><br /><br />It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian merchant<br />associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the earliest of the<br />south Indian merchant associations to appear in local records, was<br />mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam (Sthanu<br />Ravi) copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar coast.<br />These record a contract between the local authority and a group of<br />resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them access, free of<br />certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port market, apparently<br />operated by the merchant group.(3) This merchant association appears to<br />have extended its influence to the east coast shortly afterwards,<br />probably with political encouragement, since the Pallava rulers of the<br />southeast had maintained close relations with the Chera state of the<br />Malabar coast.<br /><br />During the same period another merchant association had begun to form<br />further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole (called Ayyavole<br />in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit) in the Chalukya heartland behind<br />the Konkan coast.(4) They were known either as the Ayyavole/Aryapura<br />association (after their eighth or ninth century place of origin), or<br />more generally as the Ainnurruvar ("The Five Hundred"). This group<br />rapidly became the most powerful of the merchant associations. A number<br />of other merchant groups are known to have affiliated themselves with<br />the Ayyavole, those most prominent in sea trade being the Manigramam and<br />the Nanadesi. In addition, at its height, the Ayyavole appears to have<br />occupied a dominant position in relation to at least forty-six other<br />professional bodies, including major associations of artisans and<br />mercenaries.(5)<br /><br />The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain<br />crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium,<br />under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that were<br />experienced in India included such developments in the weaving and<br />dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh century<br />- of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the thirteenth<br />century.(6) Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with indigo or<br />mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large quantities<br />to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the thirteenth century.(7)<br />On the back of this expanding manufacturing and trading base, merchant<br />groups gained a large degree of control over the non-agrarian economy in<br />southern India, assuming the role of major patrons of religious<br />establishments, and being drawn into the collection of certain tolls and<br />taxes on behalf of the state.(8)<br /><br />Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the<br />internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka from<br />the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The general<br />Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was vanigrama<br />("community of merchants"), and more than one association appears to<br />have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants mentioned in<br />a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,(9) and the term Manigramam was a<br />local variant.<br /><br />The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the end of<br />the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline<br />accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the<br />Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu carved up<br />the Chola territory.(10) Zhao Rugua (Chau Ju-kua), writing in the port<br />of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state was at<br />war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several states on<br />the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a number of states<br />on the east coast of India - an active exporter of cotton textiles.(11)<br />This impression of changing fortunes is reinforced by the three early<br />thirteenth century hoards of Chinese coins found on the coast of Tamil<br />Nadu,(12) which were probably abandoned by the mid-thirteenth century<br />due to local upheavals. The mid-thirteenth century efforts of the<br />Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to revive trade in the southeast Indian port of<br />Motupalli by promising greater safety and stability reflect the growing<br />turbulence in the<br />region.(13)<br /><br />The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into the<br />fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade<br />continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and<br />integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were issuing<br />fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these associations<br />continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either their<br />structures and modes of operation were changing, or their economic and<br />political power were declining. Despite these changes, individual<br />traders on India's coasts continued to export the cotton textiles and<br />dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the Middle East and<br />in maritime Southeast Asia.<br /><br />SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES<br /><br />South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend their<br />activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite their<br />apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai peninsula (see<br />below), the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole and the Manigramam<br />seems to have been the western sector of the Indian Ocean and the Middle<br />East. By the tenth century, however, the Asian sea trade boom had begun<br />to draw more East and Southeast Asian trade into the Indian Ocean. <br /><br />The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations<br />spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior and<br />to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern Kalinga, the<br />Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,(14) largely under the<br />auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations remained<br />powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, but lost<br />ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of that<br />century.<br /><br />The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in Southeast<br />Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, probably because of<br />the strength of competing local vested interests in trade. It is also<br />important to note that not all South Asians trading in maritime<br />Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom were clearly associated<br />with South Indian merchant groups. <br /><br />Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a clear<br />picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and<br />Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this period<br />suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in large<br />enough numbers to be classified by region. <br /><br />These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama (the<br />Javanized version of vanigrama) was used in Javanese and Balinese port<br />texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather fluid,<br />port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign merchants,<br />some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from local rulers.<br /><br />Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about<br />overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of the<br />lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to reflect<br />changing patterns of trade.(15) The earliest dated original inscription<br />to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan(16) from Kedu in central<br />Java, dated 883 A.D. <br /><br />The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland<br />Southeast Asians from Campa (Champa), Remman (Ramanyadesa, in Mon Lower<br />Burma), and Kmira (Cambodia); the listed South Asians came from Kling<br />(Kalinga), Aryya (Aryapura/Ayyavole), Pandikira (in Kamataka), and<br />perhaps Singhala (Sri Lanka) - although this last reading is uncertain.<br />The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth century to<br />contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of<br />927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river near<br />Madiun(17) - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.<br /><br />The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been<br />preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not changed<br />markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan inscription.<br />The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and early tenth<br />centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east coast districts<br />of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, or from<br />the western Konkan coastal region already dominated by the Ayyavole<br />merchant association. These three regions remained a constant in the<br />Javanese lists from the ninth to the fourteenth century. <br /><br />The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga -<br />appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early<br />date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil It was perhaps because of<br />the region's dominance of the early textile exports to Southeast Asia<br />that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in the Indonesian archipelago<br />as a blanket-term covering all South Asians, and in some cases all<br />foreigners from the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant associations<br />from the west coast of southern India towards the east, stimulated by<br />increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was accompanied by a<br />broadening of the range of commodities traded. South Indian trade with<br />the Middle East had been dominated by such exports as black pepper,<br />areca nuts and iron.<br /><br />(18) Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth<br />century and may have played an important role in trade with such<br />Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own iron<br />sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association activities<br />to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton- producing region<br />stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka to the southern<br />coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to gain more prominence in the<br />list of exports.<br /><br />Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of the<br />later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in popularity<br />of Indian export cloths at this time.(19) Four original Javanese<br />inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the eleventh<br />century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. <br /><br /><br />The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,(20) from the Brantas delta region of<br />east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, Pandikira,<br />Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of<br />Patakan,(21) from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was<br />commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. <br /><br /><br />The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast<br />Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the<br />Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power within<br />southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then extended<br />their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives by the first<br />decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined the merchants<br />operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast Asia. The Chola<br />state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major player in the eastern<br />sector of the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among Indian<br />exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />(22) Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese statuary<br />reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />printed Indian export textiles during this period.(23) By the 1040s and<br />1050s, when the Turun Hyang(24) and Garaman(25) inscriptions were<br />written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in the<br />lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika (Chola), and Pandikira by<br />Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the list<br />the name Malyala (the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar coast).<br /><br />By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South Asian<br />regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably operating<br />from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well have been<br />members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant<br />associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to have<br />been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather than as<br />representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as tax farmers<br />in east Java.<br /><br />They appear to have operated on the same footing as local merchants or<br />those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.(26)<br /><br />There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of<br />inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of the<br />eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and the end<br />of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the division of<br />Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of Janggala, though<br />active in trade, left few records on permanent materials - unlike its<br />sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. <br /><br /><br />The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves of<br />former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until the<br />Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent<br />materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier<br />charters. <br /><br />The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.(27) is the only original Majapahit<br />inscription found to date that contains a list of tax- farming<br />foreigners. The list reads as follows:<br /><br />"...wargga kilalan (tax-farmer group): Kling, Aryya, [.....], Singhala,<br />Karnataka, [.....], Cina (China), Campa (Champa), Mandisi (?), Caremin<br />(Ramanyadesa), Kmir (Cambodia),..."<br /><br />The significant addition found in this list is China, whose merchants<br />had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially- pressed<br />Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and wait for it to<br />arrive.

At the same time, the regions of India represented in<br />the legible portion of the Balawi list were those that had been there<br />from the ninth century onwards - the east-coast regions of Andhra<br />Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west- coast Aryapura/Ayyavole heartland<br />of the dominant (though now fading) merchant association. The decline of<br />the Chola empire and the partial disruption of trade in eastern waters<br />during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries clearly had<br />not led to an abandoning of trade links between Indian ports and those<br />of maritime Southeast Asia.<br /><br />The Nagarakertagama,(29) a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D.,<br />mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast<br />Asia, and Jambudwipa (India) - specifically from Goda (Gaur in<br />Bengal) and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away from<br />the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance of the<br />Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese lists of<br />Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile trade.

These<br />  associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.<br />  <br />  Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more<br />  dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the locus <br />of<br />  large agrarian states. For much of the region&#39;s history, power was<br />  fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states <br />with<br />  different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast &#40;Coromandel <br />or<br />  Cholamandala&#41; coast; Malayalam along the southwest &#40;Malabar&#41; coast;<br />  Telegu on the eastern &#40;Andhra&#41; coast north of the Tamil heartland; <br />and<br />  Kanarese on the western &#40;now Konkan&#41; coast to the north of the <br />Malabar<br />  region. Many of these states relied upon overseas trade to enhance <br />their<br />  limited agricultural income. The Pallavas were the first Tamil <br />rulers of<br />  real consequence. <br />  <br />  They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, <br />and<br />  their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the <br />early<br />  Hindu remains of the maritime region.<br />  <br />  Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by <br />the<br />  later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power in <br />the<br />  southeast by the Cholas. <br />  <br />  The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the <br />Pallavas,<br />  and expanded their links with merchant associations.<br />  <br />  Much of southern India&#39;s sea trade during the late first and early<br />  second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the <br />most<br />  important of which appear to have first formed in southwest India.<br />  <br />  <br />  During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India&#39;s <br />trade<br />  had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, Jewish,<br />  Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia and the<br />  Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar coast. <br />  <br />  <br />  It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian <br />merchant<br />  associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the earliest of <br />the<br />  south Indian merchant associations to appear in local records, was<br />  mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam &#40;Sthanu<br />  Ravi&#41; copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar <br />coast.<br />  These record a contract between the local authority and a group of<br />  resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them access, free <br />of<br />  certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port market, <br />apparently<br />  operated by the merchant group.&#40;3&#41; This merchant association appears <br />to<br />  have extended its influence to the east coast shortly afterwards,<br />  probably with political encouragement, since the Pallava rulers of <br />the<br />  southeast had maintained close relations with the Chera state of the<br />  Malabar coast.<br />  <br />  During the same period another merchant association had begun to <br />form<br />  further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole &#40;called <br />Ayyavole<br />  in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit&#41; in the Chalukya heartland <br />behind<br />  the Konkan coast.&#40;4&#41; They were known either as the Ayyavole/Aryapura<br />  association &#40;after their eighth or ninth century place of origin&#41;, <br />or<br />  more generally as the Ainnurruvar &#40;"The Five Hundred"&#41;. This group<br />  rapidly became the most powerful of the merchant associations. A <br />number<br />  of other merchant groups are known to have affiliated themselves <br />with<br />  the Ayyavole, those most prominent in sea trade being the Manigramam <br />and<br />  the Nanadesi. In addition, at its height, the Ayyavole appears to <br />have<br />  occupied a dominant position in relation to at least forty-six other<br />  professional bodies, including major associations of artisans and<br />  mercenaries.&#40;5&#41;<br />  <br />  The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain<br />  crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium,<br />  under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />  merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that <br />were<br />  experienced in India included such developments in the weaving and<br />  dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh <br />century<br />  - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the thirteenth<br />  century.&#40;6&#41; Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with indigo or<br />  mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large <br />quantities<br />  to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the thirteenth <br />century.&#40;7&#41;<br />  On the back of this expanding manufacturing and trading base, <br />merchant<br />  groups gained a large degree of control over the non-agrarian <br />economy in<br />  southern India, assuming the role of major patrons of religious<br />  establishments, and being drawn into the collection of certain tolls <br />and<br />  taxes on behalf of the state.&#40;8&#41;<br />  <br />  Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the<br />  internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka <br />from<br />  the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The general<br />  Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was vanigrama<br />  &#40;"community of merchants"&#41;, and more than one association appears to<br />  have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />  Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants mentioned <br />in<br />  a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,&#40;9&#41; and the term Manigramam <br />was a<br />  local variant.<br />  <br />  The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the end <br />of<br />  the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline<br />  accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the<br />  Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu <br />carved up<br />  the Chola territory.&#40;10&#41; Zhao Rugua &#40;Chau Ju-kua&#41;, writing in the <br />port<br />  of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state was <br />at<br />  war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several states <br />on<br />  the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a number of <br />states<br />  on the east coast of India - an active exporter of cotton textiles.<br />&#40;11&#41;<br />  This impression of changing fortunes is reinforced by the three <br />early<br />  thirteenth century hoards of Chinese coins found on the coast of <br />Tamil<br />  Nadu,&#40;12&#41; which were probably abandoned by the mid-thirteenth <br />century<br />  due to local upheavals. The mid-thirteenth century efforts of the<br />  Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to revive trade in the southeast Indian <br />port of<br />  Motupalli by promising greater safety and stability reflect the <br />growing<br />  turbulence in the<br />  region.&#40;13&#41;<br />  <br />  The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into <br />the<br />  fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade<br />  continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and<br />  integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />  By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were <br />issuing<br />  fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these associations<br />  continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either their<br />  structures and modes of operation were changing, or their economic <br />and<br />  political power were declining. Despite these changes, individual<br />  traders on India&#39;s coasts continued to export the cotton textiles <br />and<br />  dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the Middle East <br />and<br />  in maritime Southeast Asia.<br />  <br />  SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES<br />  <br />  South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend <br />their<br />  activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite their<br />  apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai peninsula <br />&#40;see<br />  below&#41;, the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole and the <br />Manigramam<br />  seems to have been the western sector of the Indian Ocean and the <br />Middle<br />  East. By the tenth century, however, the Asian sea trade boom had <br />begun<br />  to draw more East and Southeast Asian trade into the Indian Ocean. <br />  <br />  The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations<br />  spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior <br />and<br />  to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern Kalinga, <br />the<br />  Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,&#40;14&#41; largely under the<br />  auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations remained<br />  powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, but lost<br />  ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of that<br />  century.<br />  <br />  The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in <br />Southeast<br />  Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, probably <br />because of<br />  the strength of competing local vested interests in trade. It is <br />also<br />  important to note that not all South Asians trading in maritime<br />  Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom were clearly <br />associated<br />  with South Indian merchant groups. <br />  <br />  Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a <br />clear<br />  picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and<br />  Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this <br />period<br />  suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in large<br />  enough numbers to be classified by region. <br />  <br />  These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama &#40;the<br />  Javanized version of vanigrama&#41; was used in Javanese and Balinese <br />port<br />  texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather fluid,<br />  port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign <br />merchants,<br />  some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from local <br />rulers.<br />  <br />  Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about<br />  overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of <br />the<br />  lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to <br />reflect<br />  changing patterns of trade.&#40;15&#41; The earliest dated original <br />inscription<br />  to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan&#40;16&#41; from Kedu in <br />central<br />  Java, dated 883 A.D. <br />  <br />  The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland<br />  Southeast Asians from Campa &#40;Champa&#41;, Remman &#40;Ramanyadesa, in Mon <br />Lower<br />  Burma&#41;, and Kmira &#40;Cambodia&#41;; the listed South Asians came from <br />Kling<br />  &#40;Kalinga&#41;, Aryya &#40;Aryapura/Ayyavole&#41;, Pandikira &#40;in Kamataka&#41;, and<br />  perhaps Singhala &#40;Sri Lanka&#41; - although this last reading is <br />uncertain.<br />  The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth century to<br />  contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of<br />  927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river <br />near<br />  Madiun&#40;17&#41; - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.<br />  <br />  The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been<br />  preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not <br />changed<br />  markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan <br />inscription.<br />  The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and early tenth<br />  centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east coast <br />districts<br />  of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, or <br />from<br />  the western Konkan coastal region already dominated by the Ayyavole<br />  merchant association. These three regions remained a constant in the<br />  Javanese lists from the ninth to the fourteenth century. <br />  <br />  The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga -<br />  appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early<br />  date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil It was perhaps because <br />of<br />  the region&#39;s dominance of the early textile exports to Southeast <br />Asia<br />  that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in the Indonesian <br />archipelago<br />  as a blanket-term covering all South Asians, and in some cases all<br />  foreigners from the Indian Ocean.<br />  <br />  The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant <br />associations<br />  from the west coast of southern India towards the east, stimulated <br />by<br />  increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was accompanied <br />by a<br />  broadening of the range of commodities traded. South Indian trade <br />with<br />  the Middle East had been dominated by such exports as black pepper,<br />  areca nuts and iron.<br />  <br />  &#40;18&#41; Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth<br />  century and may have played an important role in trade with such<br />  Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own <br />iron<br />  sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association <br />activities<br />  to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton- producing <br />region<br />  stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka to the <br />southern<br />  coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to gain more prominence in <br />the<br />  list of exports.<br />  <br />  Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of <br />the<br />  later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in <br />popularity<br />  of Indian export cloths at this time.&#40;19&#41; Four original Javanese<br />  inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the <br />eleventh<br />  century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. <br />  <br />  <br />  The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,&#40;20&#41; from the Brantas delta region <br />of<br />  east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, Pandikira,<br />  Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of<br />  Patakan,&#40;21&#41; from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was<br />  commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. <br />  <br />  <br />  The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast<br />  Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the<br />  Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power <br />within<br />  southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then <br />extended<br />  their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives by the <br />first<br />  decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined the <br />merchants<br />  operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast Asia. The Chola<br />  state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major player in the <br />eastern<br />  sector of the Indian Ocean.<br />  <br />  Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among <br />Indian<br />  exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />  &#40;22&#41; Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese <br />statuary<br />  reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />  printed Indian export textiles during this period.&#40;23&#41; By the 1040s <br />and<br />  1050s, when the Turun Hyang&#40;24&#41; and Garaman&#40;25&#41; inscriptions were<br />  written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in <br />the<br />  lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika &#40;Chola&#41;, and Pandikira by<br />  Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the <br />list<br />  the name Malyala &#40;the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar coast<br />&#41;.<br />  <br />  By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South <br />Asian<br />  regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably <br />operating<br />  from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well have been<br />  members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant<br />  associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to <br />have<br />  been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather than as<br />  representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as tax <br />farmers<br />  in east Java.<br />  <br />  They appear to have operated on the same footing as local merchants <br />or<br />  those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.&#40;26&#41;<br />  <br />  There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of<br />  inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of <br />the<br />  eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and the <br />end<br />  of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the <br />division of<br />  Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of Janggala, though<br />  active in trade, left few records on permanent materials - unlike <br />its<br />  sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. <br />  <br />  <br />  The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves <br />of<br />  former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until the<br />  Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />  that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent<br />  materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier<br />  charters. <br />  <br />  The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.&#40;27&#41; is the only original <br />Majapahit<br />  inscription found to date that contains a list of tax- farming<br />  foreigners. The list reads as follows:<br />  <br />  "...wargga kilalan &#40;tax-farmer group&#41;: Kling, Aryya, [.....], <br />Singhala,<br />  Karnataka, [.....], Cina &#40;China&#41;, Campa &#40;Champa&#41;, Mandisi &#40;?&#41;, <br />Caremin<br />  &#40;Ramanyadesa&#41;, Kmir &#40;Cambodia&#41;,..."<br />  <br />  The significant addition found in this list is China, whose <br />merchants<br />  had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially- <br />pressed<br />  Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and wait for <br />it to<br />  arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders appear to have <br />begun<br />  to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just as Chinese-style<br />  currency had already begun to displace the earlier forms of <br />indigenous<br />  currency in Java and Bali.&#40;28&#41; During the Mongol period at least <br />some of<br />  these Chinese merchants may have felt more comfortable operating <br />from<br />  non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the regions of India <br />represented in<br />  the legible portion of the Balawi list were those that had been <br />there<br />  from the ninth century onwards - the east-coast regions of Andhra<br />  Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west- coast Aryapura/Ayyavole <br />heartland<br />  of the dominant &#40;though now fading&#41; merchant association. The <br />decline of<br />  the Chola empire and the partial disruption of trade in eastern <br />waters<br />  during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries clearly <br />had<br />  not led to an abandoning of trade links between Indian ports and <br />those<br />  of maritime Southeast Asia.<br />  <br />  The Nagarakertagama,&#40;29&#41; a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D.,<br />  mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast<br />  Asia, and Jambudwipa &#40;India&#41; - specifically from Goda &#40;Gaur in<br />  Bengal&#41; and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away <br />from<br />  the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance of <br />the<br />  Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese lists of<br />  Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile trade. <br />Patterned<br />  textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth- century statuary<br />  from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some of the patterns<br />  preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of those centuries<br />  found at Egyptian sites.&#40;30&#41; Although some of the patterns on <br />Javanese<br />  statuary may represent local batik copies of Indian export cloths, <br />there<br />  is no doubt that Indian printed cottons were hugely popular all <br />around<br />  the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by this time. Even during this <br />century<br />  of relative trade depression in parts of maritime Southeast Asia,<br />  India&#39;s cottons found a ready market.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  Yahoo!

			<div class="content">yes Subramaniam,<br /><br />This time one more article from Bengal website<br /><br />Mahipala Vs Rajendra chola (Distance between the two country is 2000 <br />km)<br /><br />Mahipala I (c 995-1043 AD) is considered the second founder of the <br />pala dynasty. <br /><br />The existence of the continuous rule of the chandra dynasty in this <br />area from the early 10th century AD onwards is now established beyond <br />any doubt. Govindachandra was a contemporary of Mahipala and Rajendra <br />Chola's army found both of them, the former in Vangaladesha and the <br />latter in Uttara Radha.<br />Mahipala held authority over southern Bihar (Magadha) and towards the <br />close of his reign over northern Bihar. <br /><br />The Chola inscription (Tirumulai inscription), which records Rajendra <br />Chola's invasion of Bengal some time in between 1021 and 1024 AD, <br />throws further light on the condition of Bengal.<br /><br />The inscription records that after conquering Orissa the Chola <br />general seized Dandabhukti after having destroyed Dharmapala <br />(possibly belonging to the Kamboja line) and reached southern Radha <br />where he met Ranashura. Then the army reached Vangaladesha, where the <br />rainwater never stopped, and Govindachandra fled having descended <br />from his elephant and subsequently they met Mahipala in northern <br />Radha.<br /><br />The narration of the Chola inscription clearly places Govindachandra <br />in south-eastern Bengal and Mahipala is northern and western Bengal. <br /><br />Mahipala seems to have a long reign as his two Imadpur inscriptions <br />are dated in his 48th year. Mahipala, on his accession, found the <br />Pala empire confined to southern Bihar and in his early years he <br />fought successfully to recover northern and western Bengal from the <br />Kambojas. <br /><br />Towards the close of his reign he succeeded in spreading Pala <br />authority in northern Bihar. So he must be given the credit for re-<br />establishing Pala authority over their original kingdom, except a <br />portion of southern west Bengal, where Ranasura and Dharmapala ruled.<br /><br />Mahipala was better known for his peaceful pursuits. A number of <br />towns and large tanks still bear his name. Mahiganj in Rangpur <br />district, Mahipur in Bogra district, Mahisantosa in Dinajpur district <br />and Mahipala in Murshidabad district; Mahipaladighi (tank) in <br />Dinajpur and Mahipala's Sagardighi in Murshidabad - all these still <br />bear testimony to his deeds and the high esteem in which the people <br />held him. <br /><br />It is further reflected in the numerous ballads believed to exist in <br />Bengal commemorating his name. Brndaban Das wrote in his chaitanya <br />bhagavat (1572 AD) that the people of Bengal in the early part of the <br />16th century were very fond of these songs of Mahipala.<br /><br />The popularity of these songs and the name of Mahipala are reflected <br />in the common saying, Dhan bhante Mahipaler git (songs of Mahipala <br />while husking rice), which is still prevalent in rural Bengal. <br /><br />Possibly after early years of war Mahipala devoted himself to <br />peaceful pursuits and religious activities. His public works endeared <br />him to the hearts of the people of Bengal. <br /><br />The excavations at paharpur have revealed the revival of Pala power <br />under Mahipala as manifest in the wholesale renovation of the main <br />temple and in the monastic cells and in the numerous votive stupas at <br />the shrine of Tara in the Satyapir Bhita<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->,  <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Is this the same article at <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ismaili.net/Source/0104c.html">http://www.ismaili.net/Source/0104c.html</a><!-- m -->?<br />  <br />  Thank you,<br />  <br />  Subramaniam.S<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  -----Original Message-----<br />  From:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com<br />  [mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of s.balasubramani<br />  Sent: Thursday, August 10, 2006 10:25 AM<br />  To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE <br />IN<br />  SOUTH INDIA<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE IN SOUTH INDIA<br />  <br />  Merchant associations or guilds were features common to many <br />medieval<br />  economies.<br />  <br />  The major Asian trade boom of the tenth to thirteenth centuries <br />appears<br />  to have stimulated a significant restructuring of the <br />administration of<br />  trade in most major economies of Asia, North Africa and Europe. <br />  <br />  The Middle Eastern commenda-type investment contract &#40;qirad, etc.&#41;,<br />  which had become such an important tool of commercial activity in <br />the<br />  Middle East by the tenth century, was introduced into Italian <br />seaports<br />  by the early eleventh century, thus providing a major impetus for <br />the<br />  expansion of trade in medieval Europe.<br />  <br />  &#40;1&#41; In China, the hang developed from a trading quarter into a <br />nearly<br />  autonomous trade association, and the organization of collective<br />  financing and management of overseas shipping ventures became<br />  increasingly complex.&#40;2&#41; And in southern India a series of merchant<br />  associations developed powerful networks and vertical monopolies <br />that<br />  included not only tied manufacturers but also private armies. These<br />  associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.<br />  <br />  Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more<br />  dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the <br />locus of<br />  large agrarian states. For much of the region&#39;s history, power was<br />  fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states <br />with<br />  different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast &#40;Coromandel <br />or<br />  Cholamandala&#41; coast; Malayalam along the southwest &#40;Malabar&#41; coast;<br />  Telegu on the eastern &#40;Andhra&#41; coast north of the Tamil heartland; <br />and<br />  Kanarese on the western &#40;now Konkan&#41; coast to the north of the <br />Malabar<br />  region. Many of these states relied upon overseas trade to enhance <br />their<br />  limited agricultural income. The Pallavas were the first Tamil <br />rulers of<br />  real consequence. <br />  <br />  They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, <br />and<br />  their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the <br />early<br />  Hindu remains of the maritime region.<br />  <br />  Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by <br />the<br />  later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power in <br />the<br />  southeast by the Cholas. <br />  <br />  The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the <br />Pallavas,<br />  and expanded their links with merchant associations.<br />  <br />  Much of southern India&#39;s sea trade during the late first and early<br />  second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the <br />most<br />  important of which appear to have first formed in southwest India.<br />  <br />  <br />  During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India&#39;s <br />trade<br />  had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, Jewish,<br />  Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia and the<br />  Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar coast. <br />  <br />  <br />  It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian <br />merchant<br />  associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the earliest of <br />the<br />  south Indian merchant associations to appear in local records, was<br />  mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam &#40;Sthanu<br />  Ravi&#41; copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar <br />coast.<br />  These record a contract between the local authority and a group of<br />  resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them access, <br />free of<br />  certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port market, <br />apparently<br />  operated by the merchant group.&#40;3&#41; This merchant association <br />appears to<br />  have extended its influence to the east coast shortly afterwards,<br />  probably with political encouragement, since the Pallava rulers of <br />the<br />  southeast had maintained close relations with the Chera state of the<br />  Malabar coast.<br />  <br />  During the same period another merchant association had begun to <br />form<br />  further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole &#40;called <br />Ayyavole<br />  in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit&#41; in the Chalukya heartland <br />behind<br />  the Konkan coast.&#40;4&#41; They were known either as the Ayyavole/Aryapura<br />  association &#40;after their eighth or ninth century place of origin&#41;, <br />or<br />  more generally as the Ainnurruvar &#40;"The Five Hundred"&#41;. This group<br />  rapidly became the most powerful of the merchant associations. A <br />number<br />  of other merchant groups are known to have affiliated themselves <br />with<br />  the Ayyavole, those most prominent in sea trade being the <br />Manigramam and<br />  the Nanadesi. In addition, at its height, the Ayyavole appears to <br />have<br />  occupied a dominant position in relation to at least forty-six other<br />  professional bodies, including major associations of artisans and<br />  mercenaries.&#40;5&#41;<br />  <br />  The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain<br />  crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium,<br />  under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />  merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that <br />were<br />  experienced in India included such developments in the weaving and<br />  dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh <br />century<br />  - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the thirteenth<br />  century.&#40;6&#41; Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with indigo or<br />  mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large <br />quantities<br />  to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the thirteenth <br />century.&#40;7&#41;<br />  On the back of this expanding manufacturing and trading base, <br />merchant<br />  groups gained a large degree of control over the non-agrarian <br />economy in<br />  southern India, assuming the role of major patrons of religious<br />  establishments, and being drawn into the collection of certain <br />tolls and<br />  taxes on behalf of the state.&#40;8&#41;<br />  <br />  Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the<br />  internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka <br />from<br />  the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The general<br />  Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was vanigrama<br />  &#40;"community of merchants"&#41;, and more than one association appears to<br />  have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />  Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants <br />mentioned in<br />  a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,&#40;9&#41; and the term Manigramam <br />was a<br />  local variant.<br />  <br />  The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the <br />end of<br />  the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline<br />  accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the<br />  Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu <br />carved up<br />  the Chola territory.&#40;10&#41; Zhao Rugua &#40;Chau Ju-kua&#41;, writing in the <br />port<br />  of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state was <br />at<br />  war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several <br />states on<br />  the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a number of <br />states<br />  on the east coast of India - an active exporter of cotton textiles.<br />&#40;11&#41;<br />  This impression of changing fortunes is reinforced by the three <br />early<br />  thirteenth century hoards of Chinese coins found on the coast of <br />Tamil<br />  Nadu,&#40;12&#41; which were probably abandoned by the mid-thirteenth <br />century<br />  due to local upheavals. The mid-thirteenth century efforts of the<br />  Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to revive trade in the southeast Indian <br />port of<br />  Motupalli by promising greater safety and stability reflect the <br />growing<br />  turbulence in the<br />  region.&#40;13&#41;<br />  <br />  The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into <br />the<br />  fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade<br />  continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and<br />  integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />  By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were <br />issuing<br />  fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these associations<br />  continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either their<br />  structures and modes of operation were changing, or their economic <br />and<br />  political power were declining. Despite these changes, individual<br />  traders on India&#39;s coasts continued to export the cotton textiles <br />and<br />  dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the Middle East <br />and<br />  in maritime Southeast Asia.<br />  <br />  SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES<br />  <br />  South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend <br />their<br />  activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite their<br />  apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai peninsula <br />&#40;see<br />  below&#41;, the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole and the <br />Manigramam<br />  seems to have been the western sector of the Indian Ocean and the <br />Middle<br />  East. By the tenth century, however, the Asian sea trade boom had <br />begun<br />  to draw more East and Southeast Asian trade into the Indian Ocean. <br />  <br />  The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations<br />  spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior <br />and<br />  to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern <br />Kalinga, the<br />  Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,&#40;14&#41; largely under the<br />  auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations remained<br />  powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, but lost<br />  ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of that<br />  century.<br />  <br />  The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in <br />Southeast<br />  Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, probably <br />because of<br />  the strength of competing local vested interests in trade. It is <br />also<br />  important to note that not all South Asians trading in maritime<br />  Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom were clearly <br />associated<br />  with South Indian merchant groups. <br />  <br />  Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a <br />clear<br />  picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and<br />  Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this <br />period<br />  suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in large<br />  enough numbers to be classified by region. <br />  <br />  These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama &#40;the<br />  Javanized version of vanigrama&#41; was used in Javanese and Balinese <br />port<br />  texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather fluid,<br />  port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign <br />merchants,<br />  some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from local <br />rulers.<br />  <br />  Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about<br />  overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of <br />the<br />  lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to <br />reflect<br />  changing patterns of trade.&#40;15&#41; The earliest dated original <br />inscription<br />  to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan&#40;16&#41; from Kedu in <br />central<br />  Java, dated 883 A.D. <br />  <br />  The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland<br />  Southeast Asians from Campa &#40;Champa&#41;, Remman &#40;Ramanyadesa, in Mon <br />Lower<br />  Burma&#41;, and Kmira &#40;Cambodia&#41;; the listed South Asians came from <br />Kling<br />  &#40;Kalinga&#41;, Aryya &#40;Aryapura/Ayyavole&#41;, Pandikira &#40;in Kamataka&#41;, and<br />  perhaps Singhala &#40;Sri Lanka&#41; - although this last reading is <br />uncertain.<br />  The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth century to<br />  contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of<br />  927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river <br />near<br />  Madiun&#40;17&#41; - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.<br />  <br />  The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been<br />  preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not <br />changed<br />  markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan <br />inscription.<br />  The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and early tenth<br />  centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east coast <br />districts<br />  of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, or <br />from<br />  the western Konkan coastal region already dominated by the Ayyavole<br />  merchant association. These three regions remained a constant in the<br />  Javanese lists from the ninth to the fourteenth century. <br />  <br />  The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga -<br />  appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early<br />  date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil It was perhaps <br />because of<br />  the region&#39;s dominance of the early textile exports to Southeast <br />Asia<br />  that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in the Indonesian <br />archipelago<br />  as a blanket-term covering all South Asians, and in some cases all<br />  foreigners from the Indian Ocean.<br />  <br />  The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant <br />associations<br />  from the west coast of southern India towards the east, stimulated <br />by<br />  increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was accompanied <br />by a<br />  broadening of the range of commodities traded. South Indian trade <br />with<br />  the Middle East had been dominated by such exports as black pepper,<br />  areca nuts and iron.<br />  <br />  &#40;18&#41; Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth<br />  century and may have played an important role in trade with such<br />  Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own <br />iron<br />  sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association <br />activities<br />  to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton- producing <br />region<br />  stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka to the <br />southern<br />  coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to gain more prominence in <br />the<br />  list of exports.<br />  <br />  Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of <br />the<br />  later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in <br />popularity<br />  of Indian export cloths at this time.&#40;19&#41; Four original Javanese<br />  inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the <br />eleventh<br />  century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. <br />  <br />  <br />  The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,&#40;20&#41; from the Brantas delta <br />region of<br />  east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, Pandikira,<br />  Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of<br />  Patakan,&#40;21&#41; from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was<br />  commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. <br />  <br />  <br />  The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast<br />  Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the<br />  Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power <br />within<br />  southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then <br />extended<br />  their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives by the <br />first<br />  decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined the <br />merchants<br />  operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast Asia. The Chola<br />  state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major player in the <br />eastern<br />  sector of the Indian Ocean.<br />  <br />  Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among <br />Indian<br />  exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />  &#40;22&#41; Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese <br />statuary<br />  reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />  printed Indian export textiles during this period.&#40;23&#41; By the 1040s <br />and<br />  1050s, when the Turun Hyang&#40;24&#41; and Garaman&#40;25&#41; inscriptions were<br />  written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in <br />the<br />  lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika &#40;Chola&#41;, and Pandikira by<br />  Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the <br />list<br />  the name Malyala &#40;the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar <br />coast&#41;.<br />  <br />  By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South <br />Asian<br />  regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably <br />operating<br />  from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well have been<br />  members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant<br />  associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to <br />have<br />  been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather than as<br />  representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as tax <br />farmers<br />  in east Java.<br />  <br />  They appear to have operated on the same footing as local <br />merchants or<br />  those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.&#40;26&#41;<br />  <br />  There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of<br />  inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of <br />the<br />  eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and the <br />end<br />  of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the <br />division of<br />  Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of Janggala, though<br />  active in trade, left few records on permanent materials - unlike <br />its<br />  sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. <br />  <br />  <br />  The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves <br />of<br />  former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until the<br />  Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />  that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent<br />  materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier<br />  charters. <br />  <br />  The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.&#40;27&#41; is the only original <br />Majapahit<br />  inscription found to date that contains a list of tax- farming<br />  foreigners. The list reads as follows:<br />  <br />  "...wargga kilalan &#40;tax-farmer group&#41;: Kling, Aryya, [.....], <br />Singhala,<br />  Karnataka, [.....], Cina &#40;China&#41;, Campa &#40;Champa&#41;, Mandisi &#40;?&#41;, <br />Caremin<br />  &#40;Ramanyadesa&#41;, Kmir &#40;Cambodia&#41;,..."<br />  <br />  The significant addition found in this list is China, whose <br />merchants<br />  had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially- <br />pressed<br />  Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and wait for <br />it to<br />  arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders appear to have <br />begun<br />  to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just as Chinese-style<br />  currency had already begun to displace the earlier forms of <br />indigenous<br />  currency in Java and Bali.&#40;28&#41; During the Mongol period at least <br />some of<br />  these Chinese merchants may have felt more comfortable operating <br />from<br />  non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the regions of India <br />represented in<br />  the legible portion of the Balawi list were those that had been <br />there<br />  from the ninth century onwards - the east-coast regions of Andhra<br />  Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west- coast Aryapura/Ayyavole <br />heartland<br />  of the dominant &#40;though now fading&#41; merchant association. The <br />decline of<br />  the Chola empire and the partial disruption of trade in eastern <br />waters<br />  during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries clearly <br />had<br />  not led to an abandoning of trade links between Indian ports and <br />those<br />  of maritime Southeast Asia.<br />  <br />  The Nagarakertagama,&#40;29&#41; a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D.,<br />  mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast<br />  Asia, and Jambudwipa &#40;India&#41; - specifically from Goda &#40;Gaur in<br />  Bengal&#41; and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away <br />from<br />  the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance of <br />the<br />  Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese lists of<br />  Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile trade. <br />Patterned<br />  textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth- century statuary<br />  from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some of the patterns<br />  preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of those centuries<br />  found at Egyptian sites.&#40;30&#41; Although some of the patterns on <br />Javanese<br />  statuary may represent local batik copies of Indian export cloths, <br />there<br />  is no doubt that Indian printed cottons were hugely popular all <br />around<br />  the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by this time. Even during this <br />century<br />  of relative trade depression in parts of maritime Southeast Asia,<br />  India&#39;s cottons found a ready market.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  Yahoo!

Govindachandra was a contemporary of Mahipala and Rajendra<br />Chola's army found both of them, the former in Vangaladesha and the<br />latter in Uttara Radha.<br />Mahipala held authority over southern Bihar (Magadha) and towards the<br />close of his reign over northern Bihar. <br /><br />The Chola inscription (Tirumulai inscription), which records Rajendra<br />Chola's invasion of Bengal some time in between 1021 and 1024 AD, throws<br />further light on the condition of Bengal.<br /><br />The inscription records that after conquering Orissa the Chola general<br />seized Dandabhukti after having destroyed Dharmapala (possibly belonging<br />to the Kamboja line) and reached southern Radha where he met Ranashura.<br />Then the army reached Vangaladesha, where the rainwater never stopped,<br />and Govindachandra fled having descended from his elephant and<br />subsequently they met Mahipala in northern Radha.<br /><br />The narration of the Chola inscription clearly places Govindachandra in<br />south-eastern Bengal and Mahipala is northern and western Bengal. <br /><br />Mahipala seems to have a long reign as his two Imadpur inscriptions are<br />dated in his 48th year. Mahipala, on his accession, found the Pala<br />empire confined to southern Bihar and in his early years he fought<br />successfully to recover northern and western Bengal from the Kambojas. <br /><br />Towards the close of his reign he succeeded in spreading Pala authority<br />in northern Bihar. So he must be given the credit for re- establishing<br />Pala authority over their original kingdom, except a portion of southern<br />west Bengal, where Ranasura and Dharmapala ruled.<br /><br />Mahipala was better known for his peaceful pursuits. A number of towns<br />and large tanks still bear his name. Mahiganj in Rangpur district,<br />Mahipur in Bogra district, Mahisantosa in Dinajpur district and Mahipala<br />in Murshidabad district; Mahipaladighi (tank) in Dinajpur and Mahipala's<br />Sagardighi in Murshidabad - all these still bear testimony to his deeds<br />and the high esteem in which the people held him. <br /><br />It is further reflected in the numerous ballads believed to exist in<br />Bengal commemorating his name. Brndaban Das wrote in his chaitanya<br />bhagavat (1572 AD) that the people of Bengal in the early part of the<br />16th century were very fond of these songs of Mahipala.<br /><br />The popularity of these songs and the name of Mahipala are reflected in<br />the common saying, Dhan bhante Mahipaler git (songs of Mahipala while<br />husking rice), which is still prevalent in rural Bengal. <br /><br />Possibly after early years of war Mahipala devoted himself to peaceful<br />pursuits and religious activities. His public works endeared him to the<br />hearts of the people of Bengal. <br /><br />The excavations at paharpur have revealed the revival of Pala power<br />under Mahipala as manifest in the wholesale renovation of the main<br />temple and in the monastic cells and in the numerous votive stupas at<br />the shrine of Tara in the Satyapir Bhita<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Is this the same article at<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ismaili.net/Source/0104c.html">http://www.ismaili.net/Source/0104c.html</a><!-- m -->?<br />  <br />  Thank you,<br />  <br />  Subramaniam.S<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  -----Original Message-----<br />  From:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com<br />  [mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of s.balasubramani<br />  Sent: Thursday, August 10, 2006 10:25 AM<br />  To: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e --><br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE<br />IN<br />  SOUTH INDIA<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE IN SOUTH INDIA<br />  <br />  Merchant associations or guilds were features common to many<br />medieval<br />  economies.<br />  <br />  The major Asian trade boom of the tenth to thirteenth centuries<br />appears<br />  to have stimulated a significant restructuring of the<br />administration of<br />  trade in most major economies of Asia, North Africa and Europe. <br />  <br />  The Middle Eastern commenda-type investment contract &#40;qirad, etc.&#41;, <br />  which had become such an important tool of commercial activity in<br />the<br />  Middle East by the tenth century, was introduced into Italian<br />seaports<br />  by the early eleventh century, thus providing a major impetus for<br />the<br />  expansion of trade in medieval Europe.<br />  <br />  &#40;1&#41; In China, the hang developed from a trading quarter into a<br />nearly<br />  autonomous trade association, and the organization of collective <br />  financing and management of overseas shipping ventures became <br />  increasingly complex.&#40;2&#41; And in southern India a series of merchant <br />  associations developed powerful networks and vertical monopolies<br />that<br />  included not only tied manufacturers but also private armies. These <br />  associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.<br />  <br />  Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more <br />  dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the<br />locus of<br />  large agrarian states. For much of the region&#39;s history, power was <br />  fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states<br />with<br />  different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast &#40;Coromandel<br />or<br />  Cholamandala&#41; coast; Malayalam along the southwest &#40;Malabar&#41; coast; <br />  Telegu on the eastern &#40;Andhra&#41; coast north of the Tamil heartland;<br />and<br />  Kanarese on the western &#40;now Konkan&#41; coast to the north of the<br />Malabar<br />  region. Many of these states relied upon overseas trade to enhance<br />their<br />  limited agricultural income. The Pallavas were the first Tamil<br />rulers of<br />  real consequence. <br />  <br />  They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries,<br />and<br />  their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the<br />early<br />  Hindu remains of the maritime region.<br />  <br />  Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by<br />the<br />  later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power in<br />the<br />  southeast by the Cholas. <br />  <br />  The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the<br />Pallavas,<br />  and expanded their links with merchant associations.<br />  <br />  Much of southern India&#39;s sea trade during the late first and early <br />  second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the<br />most<br />  important of which appear to have first formed in southwest India.<br />  <br />  <br />  During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India&#39;s<br />trade<br />  had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, Jewish, <br />  Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia and the <br />  Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar coast.<br />  <br />  <br />  It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian<br />merchant<br />  associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the earliest of<br />the<br />  south Indian merchant associations to appear in local records, was <br />  mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam &#40;Sthanu<br />  Ravi&#41; copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar<br />coast.<br />  These record a contract between the local authority and a group of <br />  resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them access,<br />free of<br />  certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port market,<br />apparently<br />  operated by the merchant group.&#40;3&#41; This merchant association<br />appears to<br />  have extended its influence to the east coast shortly afterwards, <br />  probably with political encouragement, since the Pallava rulers of<br />the<br />  southeast had maintained close relations with the Chera state of the <br />  Malabar coast.<br />  <br />  During the same period another merchant association had begun to<br />form<br />  further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole &#40;called<br />Ayyavole<br />  in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit&#41; in the Chalukya heartland<br />behind<br />  the Konkan coast.&#40;4&#41; They were known either as the Ayyavole/Aryapura <br />  association &#40;after their eighth or ninth century place of origin&#41;,<br />or<br />  more generally as the Ainnurruvar &#40;"The Five Hundred"&#41;. This group <br />  rapidly became the most powerful of the merchant associations. A<br />number<br />  of other merchant groups are known to have affiliated themselves<br />with<br />  the Ayyavole, those most prominent in sea trade being the<br />Manigramam and<br />  the Nanadesi. In addition, at its height, the Ayyavole appears to<br />have<br />  occupied a dominant position in relation to at least forty-six other <br />  professional bodies, including major associations of artisans and<br />  mercenaries.&#40;5&#41;<br />  <br />  The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain <br />  crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium, <br />  under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan- <br />  merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that<br />were<br />  experienced in India included such developments in the weaving and <br />  dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh<br />century<br />  - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the thirteenth<br />  century.&#40;6&#41; Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with indigo or <br />  mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large<br />quantities<br />  to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the thirteenth<br />century.&#40;7&#41;<br />  On the back of this expanding manufacturing and trading base,<br />merchant<br />  groups gained a large degree of control over the non-agrarian<br />economy in<br />  southern India, assuming the role of major patrons of religious <br />  establishments, and being drawn into the collection of certain<br />tolls and<br />  taxes on behalf of the state.&#40;8&#41;<br />  <br />  Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the <br />  internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka<br />from<br />  the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The general <br />  Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was vanigrama <br />  &#40;"community of merchants"&#41;, and more than one association appears to <br />  have used this term or a local variant in their titles:<br />  Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants<br />mentioned in<br />  a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,&#40;9&#41; and the term Manigramam<br />was a<br />  local variant.<br />  <br />  The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the<br />end of<br />  the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline <br />  accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the <br />  Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu<br />carved up<br />  the Chola territory.&#40;10&#41; Zhao Rugua &#40;Chau Ju-kua&#41;, writing in the<br />port<br />  of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state was<br />at<br />  war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several<br />states on<br />  the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a number of<br />states<br />  on the east coast of India - an active exporter of cotton textiles.<br />&#40;11&#41;<br />  This impression of changing fortunes is reinforced by the three<br />early<br />  thirteenth century hoards of Chinese coins found on the coast of<br />Tamil<br />  Nadu,&#40;12&#41; which were probably abandoned by the mid-thirteenth<br />century<br />  due to local upheavals. The mid-thirteenth century efforts of the <br />  Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to revive trade in the southeast Indian<br />port of<br />  Motupalli by promising greater safety and stability reflect the<br />growing<br />  turbulence in the<br />  region.&#40;13&#41;<br />  <br />  The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into<br />the<br />  fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade <br />  continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and <br />  integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking.<br />  By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were<br />issuing<br />  fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these associations <br />  continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either their <br />  structures and modes of operation were changing, or their economic<br />and<br />  political power were declining. Despite these changes, individual <br />  traders on India&#39;s coasts continued to export the cotton textiles<br />and<br />  dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the Middle East<br />and<br />  in maritime Southeast Asia.<br />  <br />  SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES<br />  <br />  South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend<br />their<br />  activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite their <br />  apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai peninsula<br />&#40;see<br />  below&#41;, the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole and the<br />Manigramam<br />  seems to have been the western sector of the Indian Ocean and the<br />Middle<br />  East. By the tenth century, however, the Asian sea trade boom had<br />begun<br />  to draw more East and Southeast Asian trade into the Indian Ocean. <br />  <br />  The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations <br />  spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior<br />and<br />  to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern<br />Kalinga, the<br />  Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,&#40;14&#41; largely under the <br />  auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations remained <br />  powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, but lost <br />  ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of that <br />  century.<br />  <br />  The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in<br />Southeast<br />  Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, probably<br />because of<br />  the strength of competing local vested interests in trade. It is<br />also<br />  important to note that not all South Asians trading in maritime <br />  Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom were clearly<br />associated<br />  with South Indian merchant groups. <br />  <br />  Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a<br />clear<br />  picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and <br />  Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this<br />period<br />  suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in large <br />  enough numbers to be classified by region.<br />  <br />  These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama &#40;the <br />  Javanized version of vanigrama&#41; was used in Javanese and Balinese<br />port<br />  texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather fluid, <br />  port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign<br />merchants,<br />  some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from local<br />rulers.<br />  <br />  Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about <br />  overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of<br />the<br />  lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to<br />reflect<br />  changing patterns of trade.&#40;15&#41; The earliest dated original<br />inscription<br />  to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan&#40;16&#41; from Kedu in<br />central<br />  Java, dated 883 A.D. <br />  <br />  The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland <br />  Southeast Asians from Campa &#40;Champa&#41;, Remman &#40;Ramanyadesa, in Mon<br />Lower<br />  Burma&#41;, and Kmira &#40;Cambodia&#41;; the listed South Asians came from<br />Kling<br />  &#40;Kalinga&#41;, Aryya &#40;Aryapura/Ayyavole&#41;, Pandikira &#40;in Kamataka&#41;, and <br />  perhaps Singhala &#40;Sri Lanka&#41; - although this last reading is<br />uncertain.<br />  The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth century to <br />  contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of<br />  927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river<br />near<br />  Madiun&#40;17&#41; - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.<br />  <br />  The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been <br />  preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not<br />changed<br />  markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan<br />inscription.<br />  The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and early tenth <br />  centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east coast<br />districts<br />  of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, or<br />from<br />  the western Konkan coastal region already dominated by the Ayyavole <br />  merchant association. These three regions remained a constant in the <br />  Javanese lists from the ninth to the fourteenth century.<br />  <br />  The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga - <br />  appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early <br />  date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil It was perhaps<br />because of<br />  the region&#39;s dominance of the early textile exports to Southeast<br />Asia<br />  that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in the Indonesian<br />archipelago<br />  as a blanket-term covering all South Asians, and in some cases all <br />  foreigners from the Indian Ocean.<br />  <br />  The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant<br />associations<br />  from the west coast of southern India towards the east, stimulated<br />by<br />  increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was accompanied<br />by a<br />  broadening of the range of commodities traded. South Indian trade<br />with<br />  the Middle East had been dominated by such exports as black pepper, <br />  areca nuts and iron.<br />  <br />  &#40;18&#41; Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth <br />  century and may have played an important role in trade with such <br />  Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own<br />iron<br />  sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association<br />activities<br />  to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton- producing<br />region<br />  stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka to the<br />southern<br />  coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to gain more prominence in<br />the<br />  list of exports.<br />  <br />  Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of<br />the<br />  later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in<br />popularity<br />  of Indian export cloths at this time.&#40;19&#41; Four original Javanese <br />  inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the<br />eleventh<br />  century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. <br />  <br />  <br />  The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,&#40;20&#41; from the Brantas delta<br />region of<br />  east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, Pandikira, <br />  Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of<br />  Patakan,&#40;21&#41; from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was <br />  commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list.<br />  <br />  <br />  The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast <br />  Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the <br />  Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power<br />within<br />  southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then<br />extended<br />  their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives by the<br />first<br />  decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined the<br />merchants<br />  operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast Asia. The Chola <br />  state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major player in the<br />eastern<br />  sector of the Indian Ocean.<br />  <br />  Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among<br />Indian<br />  exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />  &#40;22&#41; Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese<br />statuary<br />  reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block- <br />  printed Indian export textiles during this period.&#40;23&#41; By the 1040s<br />and<br />  1050s, when the Turun Hyang&#40;24&#41; and Garaman&#40;25&#41; inscriptions were <br />  written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in<br />the<br />  lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika &#40;Chola&#41;, and Pandikira by <br />  Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the<br />list<br />  the name Malyala &#40;the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar<br />coast&#41;.<br />  <br />  By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South<br />Asian<br />  regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably<br />operating<br />  from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well have been <br />  members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant <br />  associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to<br />have<br />  been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather than as <br />  representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as tax<br />farmers<br />  in east Java.<br />  <br />  They appear to have operated on the same footing as local<br />merchants or<br />  those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.&#40;26&#41;<br />  <br />  There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of <br />  inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of<br />the<br />  eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and the<br />end<br />  of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the<br />division of<br />  Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of Janggala, though <br />  active in trade, left few records on permanent materials - unlike<br />its<br />  sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. <br />  <br />  <br />  The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves<br />of<br />  former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until the <br />  Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D.<br />  that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent <br />  materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier <br />  charters.<br />  <br />  The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.&#40;27&#41; is the only original<br />Majapahit<br />  inscription found to date that contains a list of tax- farming <br />  foreigners. The list reads as follows:<br />  <br />  "...wargga kilalan &#40;tax-farmer group&#41;: Kling, Aryya, [.....],<br />Singhala,<br />  Karnataka, [.....], Cina &#40;China&#41;, Campa &#40;Champa&#41;, Mandisi &#40;?&#41;,<br />Caremin<br />  &#40;Ramanyadesa&#41;, Kmir &#40;Cambodia&#41;,..."<br />  <br />  The significant addition found in this list is China, whose<br />merchants<br />  had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially-<br />pressed<br />  Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and wait for<br />it to<br />  arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders appear to have<br />begun<br />  to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just as Chinese-style <br />  currency had already begun to displace the earlier forms of<br />indigenous<br />  currency in Java and Bali.&#40;28&#41; During the Mongol period at least<br />some of<br />  these Chinese merchants may have felt more comfortable operating<br />from<br />  non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the regions of India<br />represented in<br />  the legible portion of the Balawi list were those that had been<br />there<br />  from the ninth century onwards - the east-coast regions of Andhra <br />  Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west- coast Aryapura/Ayyavole<br />heartland<br />  of the dominant &#40;though now fading&#41; merchant association. The<br />decline of<br />  the Chola empire and the partial disruption of trade in eastern<br />waters<br />  during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries clearly<br />had<br />  not led to an abandoning of trade links between Indian ports and<br />those<br />  of maritime Southeast Asia.<br />  <br />  The Nagarakertagama,&#40;29&#41; a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D., <br />  mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast <br />  Asia, and Jambudwipa &#40;India&#41; - specifically from Goda &#40;Gaur in<br />  Bengal&#41; and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away<br />from<br />  the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance of<br />the<br />  Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese lists of <br />  Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile trade.<br />Patterned<br />  textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth- century statuary <br />  from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some of the patterns <br />  preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of those centuries <br />  found at Egyptian sites.&#40;30&#41; Although some of the patterns on<br />Javanese<br />  statuary may represent local batik copies of Indian export cloths,<br />there<br />  is no doubt that Indian printed cottons were hugely popular all<br />around<br />  the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by this time. Even during this<br />century<br />  of relative trade depression in parts of maritime Southeast Asia, <br />  India&#39;s cottons found a ready market.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  Yahoo!
