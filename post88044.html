Eng/Volume</a><!-- m -->%<br />202/deivanayagam.pdf<br /><br />Interactions of the Chola empire in the Chao Phraya Delta <br /><br />G.Deivanayagam [also in PDF]<br />Tamil University, Thanjavur<br /><br />Abstract: The Chola Empire of South India (9th to 12th C.AD ) was in <br />a position to establish strong contracts with the delta of <br />Chao_Phraya Chao Phraya River of Thailand in the medieval period. <br />They have very well established this contract by Diplomatic trade <br />and religious means. The impact of this South Indian Empire caused a <br />considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious practices, <br />Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for example <br />the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but Kuranguthope of <br />Tamil means the "Monkey's forest". In the close proximity, at Bujung <br />valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances the <br />intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will deal <br />with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />history of Thai arts and Religion.<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------<br /><br />1 Introduction<br /><br />The Chola country of South India and the Siam (Thailand) of <br />Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, the <br />east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-Phraya <br />Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in physiological <br />forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of both <br />the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, preparations, <br />manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and psychology <br />are analogous.<br /><br />A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and physiological <br />diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing reveals <br />enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao Phraya <br />Delta.<br /><br />2 Early contacts<br /><br />Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two countries <br />even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and Periplus <br />references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in the <br />ancient port cities of the CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s Kaveripumpattinam, Nagappattinam <br />& Puducherry, with both east & west. The commercial trade contacts <br />between South India and Siam were very well established from Pallava <br />period of 6th A.D.<br /><br />Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east Asian <br />countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture and <br />trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not only <br />the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with no <br />doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of Swarnabhumi <br />were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their forefathers, <br />Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these Mons <br />and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts which <br />received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />northern part which received this influence after a long time.<br /><br />3 Cultural similarities<br /><br />Inscriptions<br /><br />The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south east <br />Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />countries in the early period (Chabra 1965; 72-76)<br /><br />Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. at <br />Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. at <br />Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.<br /><br />A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from Ã‚Â«SithepÃ‚Â» of Siam <br />is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these countries <br />are all Ã‚Â« GranthaÃ‚Â». Almost all the scripts of these countries of <br />Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />and Ã‚Â«ThaiÃ‚Â» is the typical example for that. The flowing and cursive <br />nature of these scripts proves it.<br /><br />TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS<br /><br />Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />reads as follows:<br /><br />Ã‚Â«Ã¢Â€Â¦(5) Varman Ku (na) Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan Naankuurula Yaa(n) Thotta Kulam per <br />Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />AdaikalamÃ‚Â».<br /><br />Tamil merchant namedÃ¢Â€Â¦Manthan dug one tank (for the Domestic purpose <br />of) by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam (which was) handed over for <br />custody (for itÃ¢Â€Â™s protection) to the people of the concerned <br />settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. (Kongknew <br />Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20).<br /><br />TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM<br /><br />The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid account <br />of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also with <br />religious provisions in this distant place.<br /><br />This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a later <br />period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a temple <br />for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable riches, <br />the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces called <br />Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />devotees. Therefore the new comer Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan from Naankur in the <br />Chola country, which was also a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s port town near to Ã‚Â«PuharÃ‚Â», <br />who earned well after having connection with this Ã‚Â«Avani NaranamÃ‚Â», <br />decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.<br /><br />PEY WORSHIP<br /><br />The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical and <br />unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola country. <br />This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected with <br />Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of a <br />skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />triangular pediment of the eastern faÃƒÂ§ade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-Dakshinamurthy <br />is also found in this temple.<br /><br />SAIVISM<br /><br />The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells the <br />influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />of Ã‚Â«Muha lingasÃ‚Â» prooves that there was a great impact of Saivismin <br />Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />structures dating to 11th C. AD(Stanley OÃ¢Â€Â™connor : 19 : 1-22). In <br />the eastern faÃƒÂ§ ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of Rishaba <br />Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were discovered at <br />Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin Ã¢Â€" Nong Hong of North East Siam. Tjhey <br />belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being confirmed <br />by the Siva of Viengsra.<br /><br />The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an another <br />evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in general <br />familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.<br /><br />IMPACT OF AGAMAS<br /><br />Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple rituals <br />and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />practices are found in Siam, should have been by the interactions of <br />the Cholas.<br /><br />VAISHNAVISM<br /><br />In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai and <br />declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu images <br />were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, Takua <br />Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic details <br />of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of the <br />Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />conclusion that: a) Some of them were moulded by the Chola sculptors <br />at Siam in Tanjorian style.<br /><br />b) Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and brought <br />to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled Ã‚Â«Thai <br />imageries of Swarnabhumi ArtÃ‚Â» mentioned about my view points. The <br />area of Ã¢Â€Â˜SitepÃ¢Â€Â™ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism and of <br />Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely OÃ¢Â€Â™Connor <br />considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological findings <br />of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical and of <br />South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of Thailand. <br />One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or Brahmin <br />towns formed in Siam in those period.<br /><br />TAMIL BUDDHISM Ã¢Â€" THAI BUDDHISM<br /><br />This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the Cholas <br />over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used to <br />classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. They <br />are<br /><br />1) Pallavanised and 2) Cholified ones.<br /><br />In cholification the Ã‚Â«Nagappattinam bronze castingÃ‚Â» technique <br />(Tanjorian) was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.<br /><br />RELIGION & PHILOSOPHY<br /><br />The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription and <br />Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />Siam, Vietnam and Laos.<br /><br />RAMAYANA<br /><br />Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. The <br />Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South India <br />(Mayirab Story).<br /><br />There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram and <br />Nangsidha.<br /><br />The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay Buddha <br />temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi hill, <br />the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word Ã‚Â«RamakienÃ‚Â» is <br />only a corrupt form of Ã‚Â«Rama KirthiÃ‚Â».<br /><br />THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI<br /><br />Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins were <br />also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />Thevaram like Ã‚Â«Mattitta Punnayang KanalÃ‚Â» etc. and Thivya Prapandham <br />like. Ã¢Â€Â˜Thiru Valuthi NatennumÃ¢Â€Â™, Ã‚Â«Uyarvara Uyarnalam UdaiyavanÃ‚Â» etc <br />are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar with <br />Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was able <br />to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt form <br />and they are chanted.<br /><br />Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />their coronation ceremony.<br /><br />GARUDA<br /><br />The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on his <br />shoulder is familiar with Thailand.

Vishnu with two consorts is a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s production which is <br />being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.<br /><br />The Hari-hara (Half Vishnu Ã¢Â€" Half Siva) is flourished among South <br />Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence at <br />Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There is <br />a great saying among the Cholas as follows. Ã‚Â«Seeing the king is <br />seeing the VishnuÃ‚Â» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling himself as <br />Narayana Ã¢Â€" Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual ceremony in <br />the Nagara Sri Thammarat.<br /><br />THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES<br /><br />In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, Siva <br />temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named as <br />Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former name <br />of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + Uthayam <br />that is the Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â». Like Korea the land of morning calm, <br />Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â».<br /><br />SWINGS<br /><br />The Ã¢Â€Â˜Great SwingsÃ¢Â€Â™ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and the Swing <br />festivals (Login wor) are all of South Indian tradition only.<br /><br />PAVAAI<br /><br />The Ã‚Â«Paavai NonbuÃ‚Â» (December and January) was familiar with the <br />Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple ritual.<br /><br />RAIN FESTIVAL<br /><br />The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of Tamil <br />in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />as Ã‚Â«We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births also.<br /><br />DEEPAWALI & KARTHIKAI<br /><br />Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the Cholas <br />in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as Ã‚Â«MalaiÃ‚Â» <br />(Thiruvannamalai fire festival) by the Thais. The float festivals of <br />Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.<br /><br />THE THAI CHOLAS<br /><br />Ã‚Â«The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as CholasÃ‚Â» <br />(Paul Pelliot Ã¢Â€" Ã¢Â€Â˜Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng HowoÃ¢Â€Â™ <br />Toungpao 1936). The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for the <br />public call for justice. (David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54)<br /><br />TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND<br /><br />The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly lost <br />their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one can <br />see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />Mongoloid Thai natives.<br /><br />The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted in <br />influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:<br /><br />Tamil Thai English <br />Thangam Thongam Gold <br />Kappal Kamban Ship <br />Malai Male Garland <br />Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />Appa Pa Father  <br />Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />Amma Me Mother <br />Guru Gru Teacher <br />Asan Asan Teacher <br />Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />Puthran Puthru Son  <br /><br />And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />similar with the Tamil ones.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta which <br />was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the Kaveri <br />river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced the <br />Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />culture by its sober nature.<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------<br /><br />References<br /><br />Chabra, Expansion of Indo-Aryan culture during Pallava rule, <br />Munsiram Manoharlal, Delhi. <br />Daweewarn, Dawee, Brahminism in South East Asia , Sterling <br />publications PVT LTD., New Delhi. <br />OÃ¢Â€Â™Cornor Stanley, Hindu Gods of Peninsular Siam, Attibus Asia <br />publishes, Switzerland 1971. <br />Kongkaew Veerpajak, inscriptions from southern Thailand, SPA FA <br />Digest, Vol. VII No.1, 1986.</div>

Yes, the churning of the<br />milk ocean by Asuras and Suras is beautifully depicted and proves that<br />we share the same mythology.<br />Infact, the world heritage site "Ayutthaya" near Bangkok, is the<br />corrupt form of Ayodhya. <br />Regards,<br />Ragothaman<br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "vj_episteme" <br />wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>I had the good fortune of visiting the new airport of thailand ` <br />  suwaranabhum" the day it was opened and was overrawed by the large <br />  mural/statue of the ocean churning. will try and post the picture in <br />  the photos shortly. was intrigued by the sanskirt incursions there, <br />  did some scouting and found this interesting article...read on chola <br />  fans....<br />  <br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://std.cpc.ku.ac.th/delta/conf/Acrobat/Papers_Eng/Volume">http://std.cpc.ku.ac.th/delta/conf/Acro ...

The impact of this South Indian Empire caused a <br />  considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious practices, <br />  Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for example <br />  the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but Kuranguthope of <br />  Tamil means the "Monkey&#39;s forest". In the close proximity, at Bujung <br />  valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />  period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />  gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances the <br />  intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will deal <br />  with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />  history of Thai arts and Religion.<br />  <br />  <br />  ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />  -----------<br />  <br />  1 Introduction<br />  <br />  The Chola country of South India and the Siam &#40;Thailand&#41; of <br />  Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, the <br />  east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />  Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />  climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-Phraya <br />  Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in physiological <br />  forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of both <br />  the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, preparations, <br />  manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and psychology <br />  are analogous.<br />  <br />  A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and physiological <br />  diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />  ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />  happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing reveals <br />  enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao Phraya <br />  Delta.<br />  <br />  2 Early contacts<br />  <br />  Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two countries <br />  even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and Periplus <br />  references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in the <br />  ancient port cities of the CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s Kaveripumpattinam, Nagappattinam <br />  & Puducherry, with both east & west. The commercial trade contacts <br />  between South India and Siam were very well established from Pallava <br />  period of 6th A.D.<br />  <br />  Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />  divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />  Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east Asian <br />  countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture and <br />  trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />  cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />  Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not only <br />  the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with no <br />  doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of Swarnabhumi <br />  were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their forefathers, <br />  Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these Mons <br />  and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />  Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts which <br />  received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />  northern part which received this influence after a long time.<br />  <br />  3 Cultural similarities<br />  <br />  Inscriptions<br />  <br />  The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south east <br />  Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />  script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />  originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />  Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />  professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />  countries in the early period &#40;Chabra 1965; 72-76&#41;<br />  <br />  Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. at <br />  Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. at <br />  Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />  southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.<br />  <br />  A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from Ã‚Â«SithepÃ‚Â» of Siam <br />  is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />  Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />  Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these countries <br />  are all Ã‚Â« GranthaÃ‚Â». Almost all the scripts of these countries of <br />  Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />  and Ã‚Â«ThaiÃ‚Â» is the typical example for that. The flowing and cursive <br />  nature of these scripts proves it.<br />  <br />  TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS<br />  <br />  Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />  Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />  settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />  reads as follows:<br />  <br />  Ã‚Â«Ã¢Â€Â¦&#40;5&#41; Varman Ku &#40;na&#41; Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan Naankuurula Yaa&#40;n&#41; Thotta Kulam per <br />  Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />  AdaikalamÃ‚Â».<br />  <br />  Tamil merchant namedÃ¢Â€Â¦Manthan dug one tank &#40;for the Domestic purpose <br />  of&#41; by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam &#40;which was&#41; handed over for <br />  custody &#40;for itÃ¢Â€Â™s protection&#41; to the people of the concerned <br />  settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. &#40;Kongknew <br />  Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20&#41;.<br />  <br />  TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM<br />  <br />  The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid account <br />  of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />  were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also with <br />  religious provisions in this distant place.<br />  <br />  This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a later <br />  period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />  Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a temple <br />  for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />  settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable riches, <br />  the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces called <br />  Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />  devotees. Therefore the new comer Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan from Naankur in the <br />  Chola country, which was also a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s port town near to Ã‚Â«PuharÃ‚Â», <br />  who earned well after having connection with this Ã‚Â«Avani NaranamÃ‚Â», <br />  decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.<br />  <br />  PEY WORSHIP<br />  <br />  The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical and <br />  unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola country. <br />  This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected with <br />  Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of a <br />  skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />  along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />  triangular pediment of the eastern faÃƒÂ§ade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />  temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-Dakshinamurthy <br />  is also found in this temple.<br />  <br />  SAIVISM<br />  <br />  The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells the <br />  influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />  of Ã‚Â«Muha lingasÃ‚Â» prooves that there was a great impact of Saivism in <br />  Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />  hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />  ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />  were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />  structures dating to 11th C. AD&#40;Stanley OÃ¢Â€Â™connor : 19 : 1-22&#41;. In <br />  the eastern faÃƒÂ§ ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of Rishaba <br />  Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were discovered at <br />  Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin Ã¢Â€" Nong Hong of North East Siam. Tjhey <br />  belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being confirmed <br />  by the Siva of Viengsra.<br />  <br />  The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an another <br />  evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in general <br />  familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.<br />  <br />  IMPACT OF AGAMAS<br />  <br />  Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple rituals <br />  and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />  Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />  practices are found in Siam, should have been by the interactions of <br />  the Cholas.<br />  <br />  VAISHNAVISM<br />  <br />  In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />  Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai and <br />  declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu images <br />  were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, Takua <br />  Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />  Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic details <br />  of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of the <br />  Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />  images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />  conclusion that: a&#41; Some of them were moulded by the Chola sculptors <br />  at Siam in Tanjorian style.<br />  <br />  b&#41; Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and brought <br />  to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />  royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled Ã‚Â«Thai <br />  imageries of Swarnabhumi ArtÃ‚Â» mentioned about my view points. The <br />  area of Ã¢Â€Â˜SitepÃ¢Â€Â™ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism<br />and of <br />  Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely OÃ¢Â€Â™Connor <br />  considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological findings <br />  of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical and of <br />  South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />  style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />  identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of Thailand. <br />  One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or Brahmin <br />  towns formed in Siam in those period.<br />  <br />  TAMIL BUDDHISM Ã¢Â€" THAI BUDDHISM<br />  <br />  This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the Cholas <br />  over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used to <br />  classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. They <br />  are<br />  <br />  1&#41; Pallavanised and 2&#41; Cholified ones.<br />  <br />  In cholification the Ã‚Â«Nagappattinam bronze castingÃ‚Â» technique <br />  &#40;Tanjorian&#41; was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.<br />  <br />  RELIGION & PHILOSOPHY<br />  <br />  The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />  prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />  Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription and <br />  Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />  Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />  Siam, Vietnam and Laos.<br />  <br />  RAMAYANA<br />  <br />  Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. The <br />  Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />  Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South India <br />  &#40;Mayirab Story&#41;.<br />  <br />  There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />  Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram and <br />  Nangsidha.<br />  <br />  The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay Buddha <br />  temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi hill, <br />  the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />  nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word Ã‚Â«RamakienÃ‚Â» is <br />  only a corrupt form of Ã‚Â«Rama KirthiÃ‚Â».<br />  <br />  THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI<br />  <br />  Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins were <br />  also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />  Thevaram like Ã‚Â«Mattitta Punnayang KanalÃ‚Â» etc. and Thivya Prapandham <br />  like. Ã¢Â€Â˜Thiru Valuthi NatennumÃ¢Â€Â™, Ã‚Â«Uyarvara Uyarnalam UdaiyavanÃ‚Â»<br />etc <br />  are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar with <br />  Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was able <br />  to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />  kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />  with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />  Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />  meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt form <br />  and they are chanted.<br />  <br />  Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />  their coronation ceremony.<br />  <br />  GARUDA<br />  <br />  The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on his <br />  shoulder is familiar with Thailand. &#40;Bangkok Emerald Buddha temple, <br />  Pimay Buddha temple, etc.&#41; G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and the <br />  Chao Phraya Delta<br />  <br />  The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />  Challenges of Thailand&#39; Rice Bowl 6<br />  <br />  VISHNU AND RAJA<br />  <br />  The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found in <br />  Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s production which is <br />  being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />  considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.<br />  <br />  The Hari-hara &#40;Half Vishnu Ã¢Â€" Half Siva&#41; is flourished among South <br />  Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence at <br />  Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There is <br />  a great saying among the Cholas as follows. Ã‚Â«Seeing the king is <br />  seeing the VishnuÃ‚Â» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />  Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling himself as <br />  Narayana Ã¢Â€" Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual ceremony in <br />  the Nagara Sri Thammarat.<br />  <br />  THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES<br />  <br />  In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, Siva <br />  temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named as <br />  Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former name <br />  of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + Uthayam <br />  that is the Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â». Like Korea the land of morning calm, <br />  Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â».<br />  <br />  SWINGS<br />  <br />  The Ã¢Â€Â˜Great SwingsÃ¢Â€Â™ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and the Swing <br />  festivals &#40;Login wor&#41; are all of South Indian tradition only.<br />  <br />  PAVAAI<br />  <br />  The Ã‚Â«Paavai NonbuÃ‚Â» &#40;December and January&#41; was familiar with the <br />  Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple ritual.<br />  <br />  RAIN FESTIVAL<br />  <br />  The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of Tamil <br />  in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />  as Ã‚Â«We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births also.<br />  <br />  DEEPAWALI & KARTHIKAI<br />  <br />  Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the Cholas <br />  in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as Ã‚Â«MalaiÃ‚Â» <br />  &#40;Thiruvannamalai fire festival&#41; by the Thais. The float festivals of <br />  Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.<br />  <br />  THE THAI CHOLAS<br />  <br />  Ã‚Â«The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as CholasÃ‚Â» <br />  &#40;Paul Pelliot Ã¢Â€" Ã¢Â€Â˜Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng HowoÃ¢Â€Â™ <br />  Toungpao 1936&#41;.

In addition the days and months names are <br />  similar with the Tamil ones.<br />  <br />  CONCLUSION<br />  <br />  Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta which <br />  was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the Kaveri <br />  river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced the <br />  Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />  culture by its sober nature.<br />  <br />  <br />  ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />  -----------<br />  <br />  References<br />  <br />  Chabra, Expansion of Indo-Aryan culture during Pallava rule, <br />  Munsiram Manoharlal, Delhi. <br />  Daweewarn, Dawee, Brahminism in South East Asia , Sterling <br />  publications PVT LTD., New Delhi. <br />  OÃ¢Â€Â™Cornor Stanley, Hindu Gods of Peninsular Siam, Attibus Asia <br />  publishes, Switzerland 1971. <br />  Kongkaew Veerpajak, inscriptions from southern Thailand, SPA FA <br />  Digest, Vol. VII No.1, 1986.</div></blockquote></div>

The impact of this South Indian Empire caused <br />a <br />  considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious practices, <br />  Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for <br />example <br />  the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but Kuranguthope <br />of <br />  Tamil means the "Monkey&#39;s forest". In the close proximity, at <br />Bujung <br />  valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />  period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />  gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances <br />the <br />  intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will deal <br />  with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />  history of Thai arts and Religion.<br />  <br />  <br />  -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--<br />  -----------<br />  <br />  1 Introduction<br />  <br />  The Chola country of South India and the Siam &#40;Thailand&#41; of <br />  Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, the <br />  east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />  Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />  climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-<br />Phraya <br />  Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in physiological <br />  forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of both <br />  the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, <br />preparations, <br />  manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and <br />psychology <br />  are analogous.<br />  <br />  A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and <br />physiological <br />  diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />  ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />  happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing reveals <br />  enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao <br />Phraya <br />  Delta.<br />  <br />  2 Early contacts<br />  <br />  Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two <br />countries <br />  even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and Periplus <br />  references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in the <br />  ancient port cities of the CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s Kaveripumpattinam, <br />Nagappattinam <br />  & Puducherry, with both east & west. The commercial trade contacts <br />  between South India and Siam were very well established from <br />Pallava <br />  period of 6th A.D.<br />  <br />  Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />  divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />  Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east Asian <br />  countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture and <br />  trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />  cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />  Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not only <br />  the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with <br />no <br />  doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of Swarnabhumi <br />  were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their forefathers, <br />  Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these <br />Mons <br />  and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />  Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts <br />which <br />  received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />  northern part which received this influence after a long time.<br />  <br />  3 Cultural similarities<br />  <br />  Inscriptions<br />  <br />  The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south <br />east <br />  Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />  script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />  originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />  Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />  professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />  countries in the early period &#40;Chabra 1965; 72-76&#41;<br />  <br />  Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. at <br />  Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. at <br />  Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />  southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.<br />  <br />  A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from Ã‚Â«SithepÃ‚Â» of <br />Siam <br />  is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />  Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />  Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these countries <br />  are all Ã‚Â« GranthaÃ‚Â». Almost all the scripts of these countries of <br />  Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />  and Ã‚Â«ThaiÃ‚Â» is the typical example for that. The flowing and <br />cursive <br />  nature of these scripts proves it.<br />  <br />  TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS<br />  <br />  Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />  Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />  settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />  reads as follows:<br />  <br />  Ã‚Â«Ã¢Â€Â¦&#40;5&#41; Varman Ku &#40;na&#41; Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan Naankuurula Yaa&#40;n&#41; Thotta <br />Kulam per <br />  Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />  AdaikalamÃ‚Â».<br />  <br />  Tamil merchant namedÃ¢Â€Â¦Manthan dug one tank &#40;for the Domestic <br />purpose <br />  of&#41; by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam &#40;which was&#41; handed over for <br />  custody &#40;for itÃ¢Â€Â™s protection&#41; to the people of the concerned <br />  settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. &#40;Kongknew <br />  Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20&#41;.<br />  <br />  TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM<br />  <br />  The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid <br />account <br />  of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />  were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also <br />with <br />  religious provisions in this distant place.<br />  <br />  This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a <br />later <br />  period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />  Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a temple <br />  for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />  settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable <br />riches, <br />  the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces <br />called <br />  Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />  devotees. Therefore the new comer Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan from Naankur in the <br />  Chola country, which was also a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s port town near to <br />Ã‚Â«PuharÃ‚Â», <br />  who earned well after having connection with this Ã‚Â«Avani <br />NaranamÃ‚Â», <br />  decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.<br />  <br />  PEY WORSHIP<br />  <br />  The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical <br />and <br />  unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola <br />country. <br />  This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected <br />with <br />  Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of a <br />  skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />  along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />  triangular pediment of the eastern faÃƒÂ§ade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />  temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-<br />Dakshinamurthy <br />  is also found in this temple.<br />  <br />  SAIVISM<br />  <br />  The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells the <br />  influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />  of Ã‚Â«Muha lingasÃ‚Â» prooves that there was a great impact of <br />Saivism in <br />  Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />  hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />  ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />  were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />  structures dating to 11th C. AD&#40;Stanley OÃ¢Â€Â™connor : 19 : 1-22&#41;. <br />In <br />  the eastern faÃƒÂ§ ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of <br />Rishaba <br />  Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were discovered <br />at <br />  Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin Ã¢Â€" Nong Hong of North East Siam. <br />Tjhey <br />  belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being confirmed <br />  by the Siva of Viengsra.<br />  <br />  The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an <br />another <br />  evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in <br />general <br />  familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.<br />  <br />  IMPACT OF AGAMAS<br />  <br />  Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple rituals <br />  and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />  Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />  practices are found in Siam, should have been by the interactions <br />of <br />  the Cholas.<br />  <br />  VAISHNAVISM<br />  <br />  In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />  Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai <br />and <br />  declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu <br />images <br />  were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, <br />Takua <br />  Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />  Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic <br />details <br />  of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of <br />the <br />  Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />  images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />  conclusion that: a&#41; Some of them were moulded by the Chola <br />sculptors <br />  at Siam in Tanjorian style.<br />  <br />  b&#41; Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and <br />brought <br />  to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />  royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled Ã‚Â«Thai <br />  imageries of Swarnabhumi ArtÃ‚Â» mentioned about my view points. The <br />  area of Ã¢Â€Â˜SitepÃ¢Â€Â™ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism <br />and of <br />  Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely OÃ¢Â€Â™Connor <br />  considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological <br />findings <br />  of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical and <br />of <br />  South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />  style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />  identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of <br />Thailand. <br />  One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or Brahmin <br />  towns formed in Siam in those period.<br />  <br />  TAMIL BUDDHISM Ã¢Â€" THAI BUDDHISM<br />  <br />  This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the <br />Cholas <br />  over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used to <br />  classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. <br />They <br />  are<br />  <br />  1&#41; Pallavanised and 2&#41; Cholified ones.<br />  <br />  In cholification the Ã‚Â«Nagappattinam bronze castingÃ‚Â» technique <br />  &#40;Tanjorian&#41; was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.<br />  <br />  RELIGION & PHILOSOPHY<br />  <br />  The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />  prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />  Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription <br />and <br />  Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />  Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />  Siam, Vietnam and Laos.<br />  <br />  RAMAYANA<br />  <br />  Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. <br />The <br />  Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />  Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South India <br />  &#40;Mayirab Story&#41;.<br />  <br />  There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />  Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram and <br />  Nangsidha.<br />  <br />  The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay Buddha <br />  temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi hill, <br />  the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />  nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word Ã‚Â«RamakienÃ‚Â» <br />is <br />  only a corrupt form of Ã‚Â«Rama KirthiÃ‚Â».<br />  <br />  THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI<br />  <br />  Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins <br />were <br />  also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />  Thevaram like Ã‚Â«Mattitta Punnayang KanalÃ‚Â» etc. and Thivya <br />Prapandham <br />  like. Ã¢Â€Â˜Thiru Valuthi NatennumÃ¢Â€Â™, Ã‚Â«Uyarvara Uyarnalam <br />UdaiyavanÃ‚Â» etc <br />  are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar <br />with <br />  Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was able <br />  to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />  kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />  with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />  Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />  meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt <br />form <br />  and they are chanted.<br />  <br />  Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />  their coronation ceremony.<br />  <br />  GARUDA<br />  <br />  The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on <br />his <br />  shoulder is familiar with Thailand. &#40;Bangkok Emerald Buddha <br />temple, <br />  Pimay Buddha temple, etc.&#41; G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and the <br />  Chao Phraya Delta<br />  <br />  The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />  Challenges of Thailand&#39; Rice Bowl 6<br />  <br />  VISHNU AND RAJA<br />  <br />  The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found in <br />  Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s production which is <br />  being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />  considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.<br />  <br />  The Hari-hara &#40;Half Vishnu Ã¢Â€" Half Siva&#41; is flourished among <br />South <br />  Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence <br />at <br />  Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There <br />is <br />  a great saying among the Cholas as follows. Ã‚Â«Seeing the king is <br />  seeing the VishnuÃ‚Â» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />  Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling himself <br />as <br />  Narayana Ã¢Â€" Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual ceremony <br />in <br />  the Nagara Sri Thammarat.<br />  <br />  THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES<br />  <br />  In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, <br />Siva <br />  temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named as <br />  Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former <br />name <br />  of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + <br />Uthayam <br />  that is the Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â». Like Korea the land of morning <br />calm, <br />  Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â».<br />  <br />  SWINGS<br />  <br />  The Ã¢Â€Â˜Great SwingsÃ¢Â€Â™ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and the Swing <br />  festivals &#40;Login wor&#41; are all of South Indian tradition only.<br />  <br />  PAVAAI<br />  <br />  The Ã‚Â«Paavai NonbuÃ‚Â» &#40;December and January&#41; was familiar with the <br />  Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple ritual.<br />  <br />  RAIN FESTIVAL<br />  <br />  The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of <br />Tamil <br />  in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />  as Ã‚Â«We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births <br />also.<br />  <br />  DEEPAWALI & KARTHIKAI<br />  <br />  Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the <br />Cholas <br />  in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as Ã‚Â«MalaiÃ‚Â» <br />  &#40;Thiruvannamalai fire festival&#41; by the Thais. The float festivals <br />of <br />  Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.<br />  <br />  THE THAI CHOLAS<br />  <br />  Ã‚Â«The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as CholasÃ‚Â» <br />  &#40;Paul Pelliot Ã¢Â€" Ã¢Â€Â˜Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng HowoÃ¢Â€Â™ <br />  Toungpao 1936&#41;. The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />  among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for the <br />  public call for justice. &#40;David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54&#41;<br />  <br />  TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND<br />  <br />  The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly lost <br />  their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one can <br />  see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />  Mongoloid Thai natives.<br />  <br />  The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted <br />in <br />  influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:<br />  <br />  Tamil Thai English <br />  Thangam Thongam Gold <br />  Kappal Kamban Ship <br />  Malai Male Garland <br />  Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />  Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />  Appa Pa Father  <br />  Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />  Amma Me Mother <br />  Guru Gru Teacher <br />  Asan Asan Teacher <br />  Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />  Puthran Puthru Son  <br />  <br />  And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />  similar with the Tamil ones.<br />  <br />  CONCLUSION<br />  <br />  Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta <br />which <br />  was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the Kaveri <br />  river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced the <br />  Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />  culture by its sober nature.<br />  <br />  <br />  -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--<br />  -----------<br />  <br />  References<br />  <br />  Chabra, Expansion of Indo-Aryan culture during Pallava rule, <br />  Munsiram Manoharlal, Delhi. <br />  Daweewarn, Dawee, Brahminism in South East Asia , Sterling <br />  publications PVT LTD., New Delhi. <br />  OÃ¢Â€Â™Cornor Stanley, Hindu Gods of Peninsular Siam, Attibus Asia <br />  publishes, Switzerland 1971. <br />  Kongkaew Veerpajak, inscriptions from southern Thailand, SPA FA <br />  Digest, Vol. VII No.1, 1986.</div></blockquote></div>

The impact of this South Indian Empire <br />caused <br />  a <br />    considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious <br />practices, <br />    Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for <br />  example <br />    the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but <br />Kuranguthope <br />  of <br />    Tamil means the "Monkey&#39;s forest". In the close proximity, at <br />  Bujung <br />    valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />    period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />    gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances <br />  the <br />    intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will <br />deal <br />    with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />    history of Thai arts and Religion.<br />    <br />    <br />    -----------------------------------------------------------------<br />--<br />  --<br />    -----------<br />    <br />    1 Introduction<br />    <br />    The Chola country of South India and the Siam &#40;Thailand&#41; of <br />    Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, <br />the <br />    east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />    Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />    climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-<br />  Phraya <br />    Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in <br />physiological <br />    forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of <br />both <br />    the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, <br />  preparations, <br />    manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and <br />  psychology <br />    are analogous.<br />    <br />    A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and <br />  physiological <br />    diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />    ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />    happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing <br />reveals <br />    enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao <br />  Phraya <br />    Delta.<br />    <br />    2 Early contacts<br />    <br />    Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two <br />  countries <br />    even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and <br />Periplus <br />    references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in <br />the <br />    ancient port cities of the CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s Kaveripumpattinam, <br />  Nagappattinam <br />    & Puducherry, with both east & west. The commercial trade <br />contacts <br />    between South India and Siam were very well established from <br />  Pallava <br />    period of 6th A.D.<br />    <br />    Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />    divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />    Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east <br />Asian <br />    countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture <br />and <br />    trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />    cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />    Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not <br />only <br />    the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with <br />  no <br />    doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of <br />Swarnabhumi <br />    were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their <br />forefathers, <br />    Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these <br />  Mons <br />    and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />    Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts <br />  which <br />    received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />    northern part which received this influence after a long time.<br />    <br />    3 Cultural similarities<br />    <br />    Inscriptions<br />    <br />    The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south <br />  east <br />    Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />    script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />    originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />    Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />    professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />    countries in the early period &#40;Chabra 1965; 72-76&#41;<br />    <br />    Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. <br />at <br />    Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. <br />at <br />    Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />    southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.<br />    <br />    A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from Ã‚Â«SithepÃ‚Â» of <br />  Siam <br />    is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />    Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />    Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these <br />countries <br />    are all Ã‚Â« GranthaÃ‚Â». Almost all the scripts of these countriesof <br />    Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />    and Ã‚Â«ThaiÃ‚Â» is the typical example for that. The flowing and <br />  cursive <br />    nature of these scripts proves it.<br />    <br />    TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS<br />    <br />    Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />    Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />    settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />    reads as follows:<br />    <br />    Ã‚Â«Ã¢Â€Â¦&#40;5&#41; Varman Ku &#40;na&#41; Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan Naankuurula Yaa&#40;n&#41; Thotta <br />  Kulam per <br />    Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />    AdaikalamÃ‚Â».<br />    <br />    Tamil merchant namedÃ¢Â€Â¦Manthan dug one tank &#40;for the Domestic <br />  purpose <br />    of&#41; by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam &#40;which was&#41; handed over <br />for <br />    custody &#40;for itÃ¢Â€Â™s protection&#41; to the people of the concerned <br />    settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. &#40;Kongknew <br />    Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20&#41;.<br />    <br />    TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM<br />    <br />    The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid <br />  account <br />    of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />    were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also <br />  with <br />    religious provisions in this distant place.<br />    <br />    This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a <br />  later <br />    period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />    Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a <br />temple <br />    for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />    settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable <br />  riches, <br />    the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces <br />  called <br />    Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />    devotees. Therefore the new comer Ã¢Â€Â¦ Manthan from Naankur in the <br />    Chola country, which was also a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s port town near to <br />  Ã‚Â«PuharÃ‚Â», <br />    who earned well after having connection with this Ã‚Â«Avani <br />  NaranamÃ‚Â», <br />    decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.<br />    <br />    PEY WORSHIP<br />    <br />    The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical <br />  and <br />    unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola <br />  country. <br />    This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected <br />  with <br />    Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of <br />a <br />    skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />    along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />    triangular pediment of the eastern faÃƒÂ§ade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />    temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-<br />  Dakshinamurthy <br />    is also found in this temple.<br />    <br />    SAIVISM<br />    <br />    The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells <br />the <br />    influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />    of Ã‚Â«Muha lingasÃ‚Â» prooves that there was a great impact of <br />  Saivism in <br />    Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />    hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />    ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />    were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />    structures dating to 11th C. AD&#40;Stanley OÃ¢Â€Â™connor : 19 : 1-22&#41;. <br />  In <br />    the eastern faÃƒÂ§ ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of <br />  Rishaba <br />    Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were <br />discovered <br />  at <br />    Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin Ã¢Â€Â¦quot; Nong Hong of North East <br />Siam. <br />  Tjhey <br />    belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being <br />confirmed <br />    by the Siva of Viengsra.<br />    <br />    The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an <br />  another <br />    evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in <br />  general <br />    familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.<br />    <br />    IMPACT OF AGAMAS<br />    <br />    Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple <br />rituals <br />    and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />    Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />    practices are found in Siam, should have been by the <br />interactions <br />  of <br />    the Cholas.<br />    <br />    VAISHNAVISM<br />    <br />    In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />    Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai <br />  and <br />    declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu <br />  images <br />    were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, <br />  Takua <br />    Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />    Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic <br />  details <br />    of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of <br />  the <br />    Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />    images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />    conclusion that: a&#41; Some of them were moulded by the Chola <br />  sculptors <br />    at Siam in Tanjorian style.<br />    <br />    b&#41; Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and <br />  brought <br />    to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />    royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled Ã‚Â«Thai <br />    imageries of Swarnabhumi ArtÃ‚Â» mentioned about my view points. <br />The <br />    area of Ã¢Â€Â˜SitepÃ¢Â€Â™ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism <br />  and of <br />    Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely OÃ¢Â€Â™Connor <br />    considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological <br />  findings <br />    of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical <br />and <br />  of <br />    South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />    style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />    identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of <br />  Thailand. <br />    One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or <br />Brahmin <br />    towns formed in Siam in those period.<br />    <br />    TAMIL BUDDHISM Ã¢Â€Â¦quot; THAI BUDDHISM<br />    <br />    This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the <br />  Cholas <br />    over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used <br />to <br />    classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. <br />  They <br />    are<br />    <br />    1&#41; Pallavanised and 2&#41; Cholified ones.<br />    <br />    In cholification the Ã‚Â«Nagappattinam bronze castingÃ‚Â» technique <br />    &#40;Tanjorian&#41; was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.<br />    <br />    RELIGION & PHILOSOPHY<br />    <br />    The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />    prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />    Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription <br />  and <br />    Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />    Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />    Siam, Vietnam and Laos.<br />    <br />    RAMAYANA<br />    <br />    Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. <br />  The <br />    Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />    Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South <br />India <br />    &#40;Mayirab Story&#41;.<br />    <br />    There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />    Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram <br />and <br />    Nangsidha.<br />    <br />    The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay <br />Buddha <br />    temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi <br />hill, <br />    the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />    nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word Ã‚Â«RamakienÃ‚Â» <br />  is <br />    only a corrupt form of Ã‚Â«Rama KirthiÃ‚Â».<br />    <br />    THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI<br />    <br />    Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins <br />  were <br />    also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />    Thevaram like Ã‚Â«Mattitta Punnayang KanalÃ‚Â» etc. and Thivya <br />  Prapandham <br />    like. Ã¢Â€Â˜Thiru Valuthi NatennumÃ¢Â€Â™, Ã‚Â«Uyarvara Uyarnalam <br />  UdaiyavanÃ‚Â» etc <br />    are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar <br />  with <br />    Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was <br />able <br />    to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />    kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />    with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />    Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />    meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt <br />  form <br />    and they are chanted.<br />    <br />    Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />    their coronation ceremony.<br />    <br />    GARUDA<br />    <br />    The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on <br />  his <br />    shoulder is familiar with Thailand. &#40;Bangkok Emerald Buddha <br />  temple, <br />    Pimay Buddha temple, etc.&#41; G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and <br />the <br />    Chao Phraya Delta<br />    <br />    The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />    Challenges of Thailand&#39; Rice Bowl 6<br />    <br />    VISHNU AND RAJA<br />    <br />    The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found <br />in <br />    Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a CholaÃ¢Â€Â™s production which is <br />    being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />    considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.<br />    <br />    The Hari-hara &#40;Half Vishnu Ã¢Â€Â¦quot; Half Siva&#41; is flourished among <br />  South <br />    Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence <br />  at <br />    Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There <br />  is <br />    a great saying among the Cholas as follows. Ã‚Â«Seeing the king is <br />    seeing the VishnuÃ‚Â» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />    Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling <br />himself <br />  as <br />    Narayana Ã¢Â€Â¦quot; Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual <br />ceremony <br />  in <br />    the Nagara Sri Thammarat.<br />    <br />    THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES<br />    <br />    In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, <br />  Siva <br />    temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named <br />as <br />    Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former <br />  name <br />    of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + <br />  Uthayam <br />    that is the Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â». Like Korea the land of morning <br />  calm, <br />    Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of Ã‚Â«Pleasant dawnÃ‚Â».<br />    <br />    SWINGS<br />    <br />    The Ã¢Â€Â˜Great SwingsÃ¢Â€Â™ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and theSwing <br />    festivals &#40;Login wor&#41; are all of South Indian tradition only.<br />    <br />    PAVAAI<br />    <br />    The Ã‚Â«Paavai NonbuÃ‚Â» &#40;December and January&#41; was familiar with the <br />    Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple <br />ritual.<br />    <br />    RAIN FESTIVAL<br />    <br />    The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of <br />  Tamil <br />    in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />    as Ã‚Â«We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births <br />  also.<br />    <br />    DEEPAWALI & KARTHIKAI<br />    <br />    Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the <br />  Cholas <br />    in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as Ã‚Â«MalaiÃ‚Â» <br />    &#40;Thiruvannamalai fire festival&#41; by the Thais. The float <br />festivals <br />  of <br />    Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.<br />    <br />    THE THAI CHOLAS<br />    <br />    Ã‚Â«The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as CholasÃ‚Â» <br />    &#40;Paul Pelliot Ã¢Â€Â¦quot; Ã¢Â€Â˜Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng <br />HowoÃ¢Â€Â™ <br />    Toungpao 1936&#41;. The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />    among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for <br />the <br />    public call for justice. &#40;David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54&#41;<br />    <br />    TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND<br />    <br />    The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly <br />lost <br />    their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one <br />can <br />    see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />    Mongoloid Thai natives.<br />    <br />    The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted <br />  in <br />    influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:<br />    <br />    Tamil Thai English <br />    Thangam Thongam Gold <br />    Kappal Kamban Ship <br />    Malai Male Garland <br />    Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />    Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />    Appa Pa Father  <br />    Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />    Amma Me Mother <br />    Guru Gru Teacher <br />    Asan Asan Teacher <br />    Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />    Puthran Puthru Son  <br />    <br />    And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />    similar with the Tamil ones.<br />    <br />    CONCLUSION<br />    <br />    Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta <br />  which <br />    was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the <br />Kaveri <br />    river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced <br />the <br />    Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />    culture by its sober nature.<br />    <br />    <br />    -----------------------------------------------------------------<br />--<br />  --<br />    -----------<br />    <br />    References<br />    <br />    Chabra, Expansion of Indo-Aryan culture during Pallava rule, <br />    Munsiram Manoharlal, Delhi. <br />    Daweewarn, Dawee, Brahminism in South East Asia , Sterling <br />    publications PVT LTD., New Delhi. <br />    OÃ¢Â€Â™Cornor Stanley, Hindu Gods of Peninsular Siam, Attibus Asia <br />    publishes, Switzerland 1971. <br />    Kongkaew Veerpajak, inscriptions from southern Thailand, SPA FA <br />    Digest, Vol. VII No.1, 1986.</div></blockquote></div>
