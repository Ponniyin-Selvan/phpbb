			<div class="content">I visited Thakkolam, yesterday. It is approximately 15 Kms off <br />Arakonam on Arakonam - Kanchipuram route.<br /><br />The route to the temple is very pleasing with lots of greenaries <br />around. The temple has only one kurukkal, Babu Kurukkal.<br /><br />He explained the temple is 2000 years old and this place has <br />witnessed a war. The because of this war the 'Mathil suvar', was <br />parially demolished and reconstructed. The difference in stones of <br />Mathil Suvar is very evident.<br /><br />But, I guess Cholas and Rastrakutas did not destroy the city that <br />much as compared to Manimangalam.<br /><br />There are lot of inscriptions in this temple and the kurukkal told <br />me they studies by lot of people, of which he remembers Muthupillai, <br />IAS, to have produced a book on these inscription.<br /><br />The city has got its name as Lord Shiva stopped the "Olam of <br />Thakkan". Intrestingly the city is gaurded by Eashwara on eight <br />directions. There is a Nandhi nearby, from which Spring is supposed <br />to flow out. Becaue of excess heat and no water this was not there <br />now. <br /><br />The main lings is on Navapaashaanam. The most famous Yoga Dhakshina <br />Murthy, is here, and we require thousand eyes to see his beauty. The <br />Durgai Sirpam is also very different and she rests on Mahishan's <br />head with only one foot, and the other raised up. She is a <br />chaturbhuja Durgai here. The entire temple is of architechtural <br />splendor. <br /><br />Temple has got a Shasta, shrine, which the priest said is ancient. <br />Presiding goddes is Giri Raja Kannikaamba, the ambal has 'Raja <br />Kalai'.<br /><br />Route : <br /><br />From: Chennai, take the straight Road to Kanchipuram via Poonamallee. <br />Go beyond Kanchipuram, where you will hit with a Bridge, take the <br />left lane to the bridge and a right turn, (left turn will take you <br />inside kanchipuram, 'Vella Gate') (This road is Arakonam - <br />Kanchipuram Road). Travel straight, and beyond Sentha Mangalam. On <br />the right side you will have 'Thakkolam koottu Road' or Cross Road. <br />There is a huge Banyan tree on this junction. Take a right turn. The <br />road is <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> pathetic. Six Kms from this junction is Thakkolam. Then <br />a small left and a eight turn will bring you to the Gopuram of this <br />ancient temple. <br /><br />Please have food at Kanchipuram or Arakonam.<br /><br />We then left to Nemili, Balathirupurasundari temple.</div>
