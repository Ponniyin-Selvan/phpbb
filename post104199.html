			<div class="content">Sriraman,<br /><br />I am happy that we are in synch to some extent. Reg. vedas,the way of<br />life etc. Its difficult for a Hindu to adopt violence, because the<br />way of life itself is based on Love. What you say is the same. Only<br />becuase we practiced love all along, other so called minorities are<br />able to live peacefully in this country for 100s or 1000s of years.<br />Hope no one has objection to this atleast. No one is advocating<br />violence here.<br /><br />The point I am trying to drive is, apart from external threats, we<br />have internal threats amongst us Hindus itself. Wrong interpretation<br />of vedas, upanishads, wrong interpratation of the varna dharma and so<br />on and so forth. These thought have been influenced by the westerners<br />which is still spoiling our society. No one is questioning the wrong<br />doings of other communities and if someone points out he is branded<br />fanatic or saffron brigade etc. I want this to change. Thats all. If<br />we stand united as Hindus and support the basic rights of ours, there<br />is no need for RSS or VHP et al. Love is the inherent characteristic<br />of Hindus and no one can deny it. As you said all other religions<br />took the basics only from sanathana dharma. By the name itself is<br />says dharma to all. But in India there is not Dharma to Hindus, its<br />available only to the minorities. I dont say they are snatching the<br />dharma from us.But we ourselves are giving it to them in the name of<br />secularism. That should be stopped and everyone should be treated<br />equal.If burning of muslim on street is wrong, then burning of sadhus<br />in train is also wrong. But you yourself saw that people talk only<br />about the first part not the second part.<br />Thats what is paining.<br />Hope things will change and Hindus realise their true weakness and<br />threat so that we all can live peacefully.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /><br /><br />--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, Sriraman Balasubramanian<br /> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Dear Mr.Sathish,<br />  One thing that all of us here need to understand clearly...the very<br />basic of life is love.<br />  True...it is not possible to be as great as a Ramana Maharishi or<br />any one.<br />  The very essence of our Vedas is that beautiful thing called love.<br />  All of us have to understand one thing....HINDUISM IS NOT A<br />RELIGION...IT IS A WAY OF LIFE....!!!!!<br />  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY TO BE A CHRISTIAN,MUSLIM OR ANYTHING<br />ELSE...WITHOUT BEING A HINDU IN SPIRIT....!!!!<br />  I am not out to brand anyone a fanatic or anti-secular or anything.<br />  The freedom of life that our Vedas has given is not given in<br />anyother religion!<br />  Another fact...castiesm is not a result of the Vedas..!!The Vedas<br />and Upanishads only define how a man who follows a particular career</div></blockquote>is to be identified.<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Just like the current day bigots are doing, there must have been<br />any number of narrow-minded bigots who made it generation-based....<br />  And who is it that says that Shudra is an untouchable...?!<br />  The word "SHUDRA" is nothing but an anagram of<br />SHUDDA+RUDRA+BHAKTHA....this is the explanation given in one of the</div></blockquote>commentries on the VEDAS by Vyasa or somebody..I do not recall<br />correctly...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But my whole point in my previous point is....why any unneccassary<br />such squabbles amongst us?

			<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />The christian schools where mentioned here, which<br />allow Hindus to wear their symbol are mostly catholic<br />or <acronym title="Computer Society of India">CSI</acronym> groups.<br /><br />But pentacost and other denomination christians do not<br />allow any Hindu to practice any type of their<br />religious things.<br /><br />Can we point out one HINDU institution which<br />discriminate like this.<br /><br />As Ms priya clearly told Deeemed university run by<br />Dhinakaran near coimbatore is having preaching hall<br />within campus and use all out the institutions for<br />conversions<br /><br />Christian schools get financial aids from govt as well<br />as from abroad and mostly appoint techers as<br />recommended by the father of the church which runs.<br /><br />These minorities use Brahmin and non brahmin<br />differences for their selfish aim of conversion.<br /><br />It is true that schools run by brahmins prefer brahmin<br />students first. So is the case with the schools run by<br />say "mudaliyar" or "Nadars". There is nothing wrong<br />with it. But if every community helps their own<br />members also, ultimnately every one benefits.<br /><br />I am not a brahmin. Brahmins might have done, say some<br />thing wrong in the past, But it is foolish to blame<br />every wrong thing happened/happeneing is due to them<br />and to allow such loop holes to be used by outsiders<br />for their conversion activities.<br /><br />Educational institution/hospitals run by HINDU<br />missioneries are real selfless services whereas the<br />same run by christian missionries have the hidden<br />agenda of conversion.<br /><br />Whether Mother theresa or CMC, vellore, there is no<br />exception. can they adopt a child named, Murugan and<br />bring him up as Murugan only till his adulthood.<br />Impossible.<br /><br />See, how these missioneries put their nets for<br />conversion in the Tsunamai affected areas<br /><br />Bye<br />MA Eswaran<br /><br /><br />________________________________________________________________________<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Dear Satish,<br /><br />If you think I am defending what other religious organisations are doing Then You are wrong all I am saying is dont look at everything thru coloured glasses....<br /><br />Mother theresa looking after the the poor in calcattu was to convert people probably right but she did look after people as well<br /><br />CMC's charity and adoptation schemes have christian names ofcourse sir why do you orphan good hindu off springs because you listen to idiotic banter like lets give birth to three children....and leave them in the street you dont look at the way they are sorted with education and shelter...<br /><br />Read Manusmrithi.....Its the literature apparently written by manu for his offsprings...Manu is the first human in hindu mythology.....It tells about all the different kinds panishments to be meated on sudras for even listenng to vedas....When was it written I dont know...Who wrote it I dont know but even african american organisations and cults claim that was the mother of Racism and apartheid and slavery...<br /><br />Infact Priya herself in an earlier mail had accepted manusasthra was fautlty...<br /><br />I do agree varna was based on so called profession and the lord sees all as one...<br /><br />I have referenced a link which Krishna says in Gita how he sees all as one...<br /><br />But is it what is practiced....Of all the people who are not muslims and christians and buddists and jains we collectively callthem Hindus....How many are not allowed to enter Temples...? Do we call ayyanar and karuppu sami as hindu deities or not....Why they were created by people who couldnt go to temples and enter them<br /><br />We talk about stray incidents....But all the stray incidents are what made our people dejected...<br /><br /><br /><br />your points are valid. I have never read the manusmrithi and so cant comment on it. But my feeling is if such bad things are there in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism would have swept away Hinduism. You yourself said, inspite of all invasion,culture or imperial, Hinduism survived. If many bad things were there, how come it survived.<br /><br /><br /><br />Buddism and jainism did spread like nobodies business Tamilanadu at one time was controlled by jains till there was tamil and hindu revival the samayakuravar and all<br /><br />I feel its the misinterpretation of facts. Probably I am wrong, but I live it to you to think. If Hinduism is so bad, how come its surviving from time immemorial.<br /><br />Hinduism was the way of life of the people...Do you get Hinduised to become a hindu?Do you have a holy bath....No we just beleieve in Hinduism...<br /><br />Suppression will alwasy lead to revolution. Frech Revolution, Boston Tea party, breaking of the USSR etc. etc. We dont have any such instances in our country. If people were suppressed in the name of caste(I do accept there might be stray<br />instances but we should not brand with stray instances)surely they should have revolted long back.Just give a thought.I am trying to thing logically. If you compress a baloon it will surely burst. Why didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?<br />What we see is the result of all that Satish...<br /><br />Buddist and jain conversions in the past...<br /><br />christian and islamic convertions in kerala were all mostly in the working class because of the higher caste domination..<br /><br /><br />Well someone just said whats wrong in each jathi looking after its own in a recent mail<br /><br />The cake cutting and althat came when our rajahs and british educated people aped a western culture<br /><br />What will a cobler or fram hand know about nall nathcathram any way?<br /><br />The Valentines day fathers day and mothers day are aping western cultures<br /><br />When I left India valentines day cards were found only in Alsa maal and Gemini complex We knew about it in MMC<br /><br />I recently went to INdian in 2003 My grandmother is wishing happy valentines day<br /><br />Ads evertwhere buy a watch and get one free for your valentine buy a jeans get a skirt free Cable networks screaming valentine sirappu thiraipadam....Was this conversion no its a young generation aping western currupt culture...<br /><br />Do you know half the popu;lation in the west atleast Uk dont know Xmas is for Christs Birthday They only know it as a day Santa brings gifts!!!!70% population dont go to churches that they are getting converted to pubs and auditoriums...<br /><br />To finalise my veiw is as Hindus we have to have a periless hindu society and then think about the other religions offending us<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br /><br /><br />Send instant messages to your online <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com">friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content">Dear Sriram and others<br />When I mentioned about various things people might think I am defending other peoples actions...We claim we all are hindus I believe I am but do all those out there believe that if so will they have been quiet when a religious leader was arrested in a religious place ......Cannot happen in UK though they know they harbour and promote terrorism mosques have not been violated...<br />The only onstance in Indian histrory has been Operation Bluestar...and Golden temple...<br />But Why did all of the HINDUS not revolt????Do we not care Or Are We oblivious Or Do we think that doesnt matter to us its somebodies business....<br />In one of the coverages one of the SPs stayed out of the mutt and Periyaval calls him inside and he says that 'Naan Harijan Sami' and Periyaal says 'Oh ippo ellarum varalame'<br />And as Satish is it pointed out The Casteless Peedam also talks of Various castes and creeds thats whats seperating Hinduism and others are exploiting it....<br /><br />Stray incidences of violences to lesser castes said one of the members there were quotes of anniliation of hindus by muslims and british and others but what do you say about this all you need is google.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html">http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Its a horrifying read....<br /><br />Ms Priya repaetedly claims Varna was based on occupation and people were elevated based on purity sincerity and leading a god life claiming valmiki and vyasa were sudras who became brahmans...<br />But Ekalyva wanted to be a Kshathriya but was refused training....Karna wanted to compete with arjuna and he was refused because of his birth and was crowned angaraja and then participated ....If it was due to valour they were termed Ksakthriyas why did this happen?<br /><br /><br />We have a better example in the Valmiki Ramayana where there is no such doubt and the motivation is clear. This figures in the Uttarakanda, which is certainly a later interpolation. However, Kalidasa?s Raghuvamsha also describes this incident. With approval, as in the Ramayana. An old brahmana?s son died and the brahmana thought this untimely death must have been due to a sin Rama had committed. He wanted Rama to bring his dead son back to life. The assembled sages decided that a shudra must have indulged in meditation. This would be permitted in kali yuga, but certainly not in dvapara yuga. Sure enough, to the south of the kingdom, near a large pond, Rama discovered a mendicant hanging upside down from a tree.<br />This was Shambuka, a shudra, who was practicing austerities so as to go to heaven in his physical body. Rama took out his sword and chopped off Shambuka?s head. Flowers rained down from heaven. The gods granted boons to Rama and the brahmana?s dead son came back to life. By the way, we always remember that Dasharatha was cursed because he inadvertently shot down an ascetic?s son. We don?t usually remember that this ascetic was not a brahmana. Shambuka phobia is a better expression.<br /><br />Just like the current day bigots are doing, there must have been any number of narrow-minded bigots who made it generation-based....<br />And who is it that says that Shudra is an untouchable...?!<br />The word "SHUDRA" is nothing but an anagram of SHUDDA+RUDRA+BHAKTHA....this is the explanation given in one of the commentries on the VEDAS by Vyasa or somebody..I do not recall correctly...<br />But my whole point in my previous point is....why any unneccassary such squabbles amongst us?<br /><br />So my point is Sriram we have to clear our house first before criticising others we have to have swayamsevaks protecting our women and kids against out fellow hindu atrocities first and then the rest....<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Sri<br /><br />Send instant messages to your online <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com">friendshttp://uk.messenger.yahoo.com</a><!-- m --></div>

B. Rajeshwar<br /><br />(Ed. note: This open letter was written to K. S. Sudershan, chief sankalchak (state or regional leader) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or National Volunteer Corps, and Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the Congress Party, and other members of the People Integration Council. The letter was written in response to Sudershan's call to people of other faiths in India to "return home" to Hinduism. The title was added by the editor.)<br /><br />Dear Mr. Sudershan,<br /><br />Of late, you and your bandwagon of associates have been asking all other religious citizens of India to convert to Hinduism so that all of us can have a unified identity called Hindutva instead of being called an Indian citizen by virtue of birth within the boundary of this country. You have also been asserting that there is nothing about this Hindutva identity of which one should be ashamed. I would be grateful if you can clarify my doubts after reading the following history of my people, who had the audacity to liberate themselves from the clutches of the Aryan-imposed caste system on the people of this land.<br /><br /><br /><br />"Why is it that we, the majority Dravidian mass of this land, should be subservient to your minority Aryan population?" a Dalit asks K. S. Sudershan, a leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in India, the world's largest democracy. (Photo: Tiane Doan de Champassak, UNESCO)<br /><br /><br />The higher caste rulers of our area, when they visited our dwellings, pointed out that the women had to go to their abodes for their enjoyment. It so happened that in one place, after pointing out the women they needed for that day's enjoyment, they found out on returning home that the women of their choice were not sent to their abode for their enjoyment. The people of that locality had decided to disobey the dictate of the higher caste. This angered the rulers, and they invoked the Manu Sasthra and its associate scriptures and meted out severe punishments in the following ways using the following principles:<br /><br />For Brahmins (Aryans): A Brahmin is the shape of dharma. The Brahmin who explains dharma reaches the glory of knowledge. . . . The Brahmin has been created as the first of all the creation to safeguard and execute the socio-religio ethical laws imposed on man. . . . The Brahmin is the first-born and of higher birth. Because of this privilege, a Brahmin is eligible to claim all wealth created by Brahma as his. (Manu, introduction) If a Brahmin gets a buried treasure, all of it will belong to him. Because a Brahmin is of higher stature, it should be taken into consideration that such treasures had been gathered of yore by self; and if a king gets a treasure, he should keep half of it and distribute the rest to the Brahmins. (Manu 8:100) Even if a Brahmin is doing menial work, he should be worshiped. (Prasara Smirthi 8:33)<br /><br />For Shudrans (Dravidians): Lead should be boiled and poured into the two ears of the Shudran who listens to the scriptures. A Shudran is equal to a burning ghat, and thus, scripture recital should not be done near him. (Brahmasuthra 1-3-38) The tongue of a Shudran who utters the scriptures should be cut and the scriptures taken away from him and the chest that confirmed these scriptures should be split. (Thirumananda Kosambi, Lord Buddha) Without asking him, with force and without hesitation, the house of a Shudran can be looted if he is not content with carrying dirt and has acquired wealth in his house. (Manu, introduction) In whichever nation a Shudran is doing the work of dharma inquiry (justice), the work that should be done by the king of that nation, then the whole nation, as it watches, suffers like a cow caught in a quagmire. (Manu 8:21) A Shudran should not be worshiped even if he is the embodiment of good character. (Prasara Smirthi 8:33)<br /><br />On the strength of the above, we received our punishment as follows:<br /><br />Our forefathers were treated worse than slaves.<br /><br />Our forefathers, both men and women, were forced to wear a long piece of cloth covering only the portion of their bodies from the hips to the knees, exposing all the other body parts for the benefit of the higher castes; called the Nada caste, they were placed at the bottom rung of the caste hierarchy.<br /><br />Our women were forbidden by law to wear upper garments, or blouses, before the reputed upper castes.<br /><br />Boys reaching the age of maturity had to pay a beard and moustache tax.<br /><br />Girls reaching the age of maturity had to pay a breast tax. The tax collectors will come and measure the upcoming breast and tax accordingly. It is recorded in history that a girl cut off one of her breasts and gave it to the tax collector as a gift as she could not put up with the molestation of the tax collector.<br /><br />We could not own any cattle or chickens; and if upper castes learned of it, they would be confiscated through the rule of law.<br /><br />We were not allowed to educate ourselves.<br /><br />Our women were abused as much as possible, which can be inferred from the following saying: It is sin to look at the modesty of the cow whereas it is the birthright of the upper caste to gaze at the naked modesty of the lower caste women and enjoy.<br /><br />Any lower caste looking at the chastity of the cow should be thrashed with neem sticks, and any lower caste women found wearing an upper cloth should be thrashed with coconut frond sticks.<br /><br />It was considered an insult to the upper caste women if the lower caste women were to wear an upper cloth, which is the traditional dress of the upper caste women.<br /><br />We were people who were untouchable only as far as the caste system was concerned. The upper castes could not eat or drink from the same plate or tumbler that we use. We were treated with inhumanity. But when it came to raping or touching or enjoying our women, by some miracle, the bug of untouchability did not defile the upper castes, which otherwise would be defiled even if an Untouchable stood very close to them. The coming of Christian missionaries and their revulsion to seeing bare-breasted women wandering around them almost naked began the process of our transformation.<br /><br />It took 37 years of struggle for us from May 1822 to July 26, 1859, to break out of this exploitation in a revolution called the Upper Cloth Revolts, supported by Christian missionaries and finally government legislation to free them of this indecent life.<br /><br />It is a recorded fact that foreigners did not donate one single penny towards the cost of our freedom struggle but only gave us advice and moral support.<br /><br />Christianity gave us relief from virtual slavery to the Aryan upper caste Nairs who were exploiting us.<br /><br />Christianity gave us education.<br /><br />Christianity gave us respectability, and we became the Nadar people.<br /><br />The liberation attained by the Nada people who became Christians was extended to those sections of society that did not convert to Christianity through another law. This is why we have Hindu and Christian Nadar communities today who are well off and well respected and considered as higher caste people.<br /><br />Of course, the sad part of our history is that in central Tamil Nadu, even until now, a part of our community is treated with disrespect because of their job as palmyra tree climbers. They are not allowed entry into the main temples. The chest of a palmyra climber will be full of bruises due to the climbing of the trees bare-chested. Consequently, everyone of this area is required to enter the temples bare-chested in order to identify the people who should not be entering the temple.<br /><br />My questions to Mr. Sudershan and his brigade of Hindu nationalists are:<br /><br />Where were our cultural champions of today's India then?<br /><br />Will Hindu cultural nationalism mean that we have to go back to our old enslaved cultural ways?<br /><br />Since in my present religion I do not have any caste, once you convert me back to Hinduism, will you provide a casteless place?<br /><br />What is Hindutva in reality?<br /><br />Why is it important that only Aryan Brahmins should remain at the top of the caste ladder?<br /><br />Why is it that we, the majority Dravidian mass of this land, should be subservient to your minority Aryan population?<br /><br />Why cannot the energy you and your brigade unleash on other religious communities be channelled toward the abolition of the caste system and the peaceful coexistence of all human beings?<br /><br />I have many more questions to ask. If you can give me and my community clear and satisfactory answers, I, along with my bandwagon, are ready to convert into a Hindu to make your goals a success without bloodshed.<br /><br />Dear Mrs. Gandhi and others of the People Integration Council,<br /><br />My questions to you are:<br /><br />What is the intention of starting this forum?<br /><br />Will this integration succeed in ending the caste system because, without ending the caste system, integration is not possible?<br /><br />Is this "People's Integration Council" being created only for political purposes for gathering votes?<br /><br />You have said that we should be proud of our past cultural history. After reading the above, do you think that I can be proud of my background?<br /><br />I would be grateful to receive honest answers on behalf of the people for whom you have started this forum.<br /><br />J.

			<div class="content">Dear Dr.Rathnam,<br /><br />First of all I am happy that you raised these issues in this <br />forum.Because some of your concerns are genuine-like the caste and <br />varnas.Some views of yours can be viewed with a different mindset.<br /><br />** Mother theresa looking after the the poor in calcattu was to <br />convert people probably right but she did look after people as well<br /> <br />CMC's charity and adoptation schemes have christian names ofcourse <br />sir why do you orphan good hindu off springs because you listen to <br />idiotic banter like lets give birth to three children....and leave <br />them in the street you dont look at the way they are sorted with <br />education and shelter...<br /><br />Hindus giving birth to many children is a result of <br />ignorance,unawareness and poverty.If they want to help us that <br />should not come at the cost of our heritage and culture.In <br />orphanages these children are converted and thrown out at age of <br />15.If such things happen in USA,there will be a hue and cry.We only <br />point out this anamoly,which any citizen can do.They do a good job <br />in helping these children,but calling it as "selfless service" and <br />giving nobel prizes isnt correct is what I feel.Call it a religious <br />service.Does religious service deserve nobel prize?<br /><br /> <br />****Read Manusmrithi.....Its the literature apparently written by <br />manu for his offsprings...Manu is the first human in hindu <br />mythology.....It tells about all the different kinds panishments to <br />be meated on sudras for even listenng to vedas....When was it <br />written I dont know...Who wrote it I dont know but even african <br />american organisations and cults claim that was the mother of Racism <br />and apartheid and slavery...<br /><br /><br />Verses from Bible<br /><br />(Colossians 3: 22-24): "Slaves, obey your earthly masters in <br />everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win <br />their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. <br />Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the <br />Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an <br />inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are <br />serving."<br /><br />"When you buy a Hebrew slave, six years shall he serve; and in the <br />seventh shall he go out free, for nothing. If he came in by himself, <br />he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall <br />go out with him. If his master has given him a wife, and she has <br />borne him sons or daughters, the wife and the children shall be her <br />master's, and he shall go out by himself. And if the slave shall <br />plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not <br />go out free: then his master shall bring him unto God, and he shall <br />bring him to the door or unto the door-post, and his master shall <br />bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever."<br /><br />Â—Exodus 21:2-6.<br /><br />"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a <br />sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, <br />as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God <br />from the heart."<br /><br />Â—Ephesians 6:5-6.<br /><br />If I give verses in quaran on slavery,"treatment" of captured women <br />it will be endless.Every religion has mud in its face regarding <br />racism.Why single out and blame hinduism alone?<br /><br />If dalits want to go to a religion which did not promote racism and <br />slavery the only religion they can go is buddhism.Other religions <br />accusing hindus of casteism as if they are perfect and holy is <br />laughable.<br /><br /><br />****** <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But is it what is practiced....Of all the people who are not <br />muslims and christians and buddists and jains we collectively</div></blockquote>callthem Hindus....How many are not allowed to enter Temples...? Do <br />we call ayyanar and karuppu sami as hindu deities or not....Why they <br />were created by people who couldnt go to temples and enter them<br /><br /><br />These issues are there in every religion.Women are not allowed to <br />enter mosques in India.Mary is accepted as god by catholics,but <br />whereas protestants vehemently oppose it.Dan brown wrote that <br />earlier christians worshipped mary magdhalene but pastors did not <br />like it,since she was a female and made her as a prostitute.History <br />is abound with examples of blacks not being allowed entry into <br />american churches.<br /><br />Timothy 2:12"Let a woman learn in silence in all subjection; but I <br />do not permit the woman to teach, neither to rule over the man, but <br />to be in silence." <br /><br />St. Thomas Aquinas, "As regards the individual nature, woman is <br />defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed <br />tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; <br />while the production of woman comes from a defect in the active <br />force or from some material indisposition, or even from some <br />external influence." <br />(source:http://www.creatormagazine.com/articles/default.asp?<br />arttopicid=196&selid=1&topicid=27&level=3)<br /><br />now what?This is a universal problem which persists in every <br />religion.<br /><br />Why blame hinduism alone is my question?<br /><br />as jesus said "Let those religions who dint sin throw stones at <br />hinduism"<br /><br />regards<br />sampath</div>

			<div class="content">*******In one of the coverages one of the SPs stayed out of the mutt<br />and Periyaval calls him inside and he says that 'Naan Harijan Sami'<br />and Periyaal says 'Oh ippo ellarum varalame'<br /><br />---- Whats wrong in this?This shows that jayendra<br />accepts that earlier there was discrimination in mutt,but now it has<br />ended.He was honest,was that a mistake?<br /><br /><br /><br />****** And as Satish is it pointed out The Casteless Peedam also<br />talks of Various castes and creeds thats whats seperating Hinduism<br />and others are exploiting it....<br /><br />---- It only talks about castes to reform the<br />system.Recently "tada periyasami" dalit met jayendra in<br />mutt,thirumavalavan was called to chidambaram temple by dikshithas<br />and was garlanded.<br /><br /><br /><br />******Stray incidences of violences to lesser castes said one of the<br />members there were quotes of anniliation of hindus by muslims and<br />british and others but what do you say about this all you need is<br />google.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html">http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />----- I have pity for that author of the website.He was<br />a RSS pracharak,from Bihar.His family was murdered by ranveer<br />sena,in Bihar(ranveer sena is bhramins private army.every caste has<br />such armies in bihar.)So he turned against bhramins.While I share<br />his grief,I can refute his website point by point.Also if that<br />unfortunate incident did not happen he would now be defending<br />hinduism.He writes those things because he is angry,not because they<br />are true.<br /><br /><br />********* Ms Priya repaetedly claims Varna was based on occupation<br />and people were elevated based on purity sincerity and leading a god<br />life claiming valmiki and vyasa were sudras who became brahmans...<br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>But Ekalyva wanted to be a Kshathriya but was refused<br />training....Karna wanted to compete with arjuna and he was refused</div></blockquote>because of his birth and was crowned angaraja and then<br />participated ....If it was due to valour they were termed<br />Ksakthriyas why did this happen?<br /><br />--- Vyasa clearly says that it was due to the jealousy<br />of arjuna that these things happened.Arjuna was jealous of ekalavya<br />and begged drona not to teach him.Similiarly karna had a fight with<br />arjuna and arjuna prevented him learning from drona using his<br />influence.Drona listened to arjuna because arjuna had promised him<br />that he will enslave durupatha whom drona despised so badly.<br /><br />vyasa bharatha clearly elevates ekalavya and says<br />what drona did was wrong.There are many instances of bhramins<br />accepting non-bhramins as disciples. vasishta accepted viswamithra a<br />ksathriya as bhrammarishi and we have saying "vasistar vayal<br />bhrammarishi".smartha Ramdoss accepted shivaji (a dalit) as his<br />disciple.Valmiki and vyasa themselves were dalits.Vyasa fathered<br />trutharasthra and pandu through ksathriya queens ambika and<br />ambalika.So even arjuna was a dalit by birth.Did drona hesitate to<br />accept them as his disciples?<br /><br /><br />*******We have a better example in the Valmiki Ramayana where there<br />is no such doubt and the motivation is clear. This figures in the<br />Uttarakanda, which is certainly a later interpolation. However,<br />Kalidasa's Raghuvamsha also describes this incident. This was<br />Shambuka, a shudra, who was practicing austerities so as to go to<br />heaven in his physical body. Rama took out his sword and chopped off<br />Shambuka's head. Flowers rained down from heaven. The gods granted<br />boons to Rama and the brahmana's dead son came back to life. By the<br />way, we always remember that Dasharatha was cursed because he<br />inadvertently shot down an ascetic's son. We don't usually remember<br />that this ascetic was not a brahmana. Shambuka phobia is a better<br />expression.<br /><br />------ With due respects to kalidasa,he himself was a dalit,he was<br />a wood cutter who gained knolwedge due to saraswathi's kruba and<br />married the kings daughter.<br /><br />Valmiki Ramayan doesnt say anything about utharakanda.It<br />ends with rama being made emperor and ends happily.It isnt there<br />even in kamba ramayana which was blessed by lord narashima<br />himself.There are thousands of ramayana stories where rama and<br />seetha are even depicted as brother and sister,hanuman has a<br />son,mayil ravana, hanuman meets baratha during lankan war etc.<br /><br />reputed vaishnava peethas and kanchi mutt have only<br />accepted valmiki ramayan as original and vyasa bharatha as<br />original.Utharakanda is not original.<br /><br />regards<br />sampath</div>

			<div class="content">Answer to the open letter<br /><br />" The higher caste rulers of our area, when they visited our<br />dwellings, pointed out that the women had to go to their abodes for<br />their enjoyment. It so happened that in one place, after pointing<br />out the women they needed for that day's enjoyment, they found out<br />on returning home that the women of their choice were not sent to<br />their abode for their enjoyment. The people of that locality had<br />decided to disobey the dictate of the higher caste. This angered the<br />rulers, and they invoked the Manu Sasthra and its associate<br />scriptures and meted out severe punishments in the following ways<br />using the following principles:"<br /><br />-------------- Very funny.Accusing the mistakes of<br />hindu kings and jamindars on hinduism is not fair.Akbar mainatined a<br />harem of 5000 women,whereas islam asked him to limit his wives to<br />4.Is islam to be blamed for akbar's harem?In earlier days kings and<br />zamindars of all countries raped poor women.Why blame hinduism and<br />vedas for acts of kings?Is anywhere in vedas it is mentioned that<br />low caste women should visit the harems of higher caste people?<br />Please show.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />****** For Brahmins (Aryans): A Brahmin is the shape of dharma. The<br />Brahmin who explains dharma reaches the glory of knowledge. . . .<br />The Brahmin has been created as the first of all the creation to<br />safeguard and execute the socio-religio ethical laws imposed on<br />man. . . . The Brahmin is the first-born and of higher birth.<br />Because of this privilege, a Brahmin is eligible to claim all wealth<br />created by Brahma as his. (Manu, introduction) If a Brahmin gets a<br />buried treasure, all of it will belong to him. Because a Brahmin is<br />of higher stature, it should be taken into consideration that such<br />treasures had been gathered of yore by self; and if a king gets a<br />treasure, he should keep half of it and distribute the rest to the<br />Brahmins. (Manu 8:100) Even if a Brahmin is doing menial work, he<br />should be worshiped. (Prasara Smirthi 8:33)<br /><br />-------- Again misleading.Bhramana means<br />saint,rishi,a stature which can be achieved by any caste.Such a<br />saint has to live only by "unjavrudhi" that is begging.Bhramins<br />cannot have lands and cannot cultivate.They can live only by<br />begging.what will a bhramin do with wealth?saint vidyaranya got huge<br />wealth.He gave it to harihara,bukka to create vijayanagar<br />empire.Vasihsta had kamadenu which could give him everything.He only<br />used it to do "adithi pooja".Wealth to bhramins is meaningless.Its<br />like giving chicken 65 to a goat.Good,but useless.<br /><br /><br />******* For Shudrans (Dravidians): Lead should be boiled and poured<br />into the two ears of the Shudran who listens to the scriptures. A<br />Shudran is equal to a burning ghat, and thus, scripture recital<br />should not be done near him. (Brahmasuthra 1-3-38)<br /><br />----- shudrans=dravidians is nice imagination.Rahuldravid is<br />bhramin.Is he a sudhra?Manudharma and bhramsuthra are not vedic<br />scriptures.Vedas and bharatha and ramayana only are authentic.Rest<br />all are later day inclusions.Show from any vedas that they call for<br />pouring hot iron into sudhras ears?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*******Our women were forbidden by law to wear upper garments, or<br />blouses, before the reputed upper castes.<br /><br />Show the quotes in vedas for this.Even today<br />in madurai old thevar women,ksathriyas dont wear blouses.It was<br />custom in those days.<br /><br /><br />*******Boys reaching the age of maturity had to pay a beard and<br />moustache tax.<br /><br />moustache and beard tax was levied by peter the<br />great of russia.It is news to me that it happened in India.Can you<br />shopw vedic scriptures asking sudras to pay moustache tax?<br /><br /><br /><br />*****Girls reaching the age of maturity had to pay a breast tax. The<br />tax collectors will come and measure the upcoming breast and tax<br />accordingly. It is recorded in history that a girl cut off one of<br />her breasts and gave it to the tax collector as a gift as she could<br />not put up with the molestation of the tax collector.<br /><br />------- Looks like shakeela movie story to me.can you give<br />evidence to this?Which kings rule did this happen?During british<br />period many zamindars ruled country and had funny laws.But again<br />what had that to do with hinduism?Show the scriptural evidence for<br />this in vedas please.which vedas ask women to pay breast tax?<br /><br /><br />********Our women were abused as much as possible, which can be<br />inferred from the following saying: It is sin to look at the modesty<br />of the cow whereas it is the birthright of the upper caste to gaze<br />at the naked modesty of the lower caste women and enjoy.<br /><br />----------------- even upper caste women wore no blouse during<br />those days.Even today in south and west TN old women dont wear<br />blouse,in all castes.<br /><br /><br />******* We were people who were untouchable only as far as the caste<br />system was concerned. The upper castes could not eat or drink from<br />the same plate or tumbler that we use. We were treated with<br />inhumanity. But when it came to raping or touching or enjoying our<br />women, by some miracle, the bug of untouchability did not defile the<br />upper castes, which otherwise would be defiled even if an<br />Untouchable stood very close to them. The coming of Christian<br />missionaries and their revulsion to seeing bare-breasted women<br />wandering around them almost naked began the process of our<br />transformation.<br /><br />Rape is universal across all cultures and<br />civilizations.As far as rich raping poor is concerned,it happened<br />all over the world.christioan missionaries came to India in 17th<br />century when ships carrying cargo of african slaves were plying to<br />USA and Europe.Its very funny to claim that they liberated dalits<br />while they enslaved africans.<br /><br /><br /><br />*******It took 37 years of struggle for us from May 1822 to July 26,<br />1859, to break out of this exploitation in a revolution called the<br />Upper Cloth Revolts, supported by Christian missionaries and finally<br />government legislation to free them of this indecent life.<br /><br />-----  And it took 7 more years after this "liberation war"--<br />that is in 1865 there had to be a civil war to liberate blacks in<br />USA.Here atleast you fought for wearing clothes.There they fought to<br />be treated as humans and not animals.So India was ahead by 7<br />years.whose side were the southern baptist missionaries in the civil<br />war?They were on the slave traders side.<br /><br /><br /><br />*******Christianity gave us relief from virtual slavery to the Aryan<br />upper caste Nairs who were exploiting us.<br /><br />------ Very funny.Mohammed ali claimed that Islam gave him<br />freedom from slavery from christians and converted to a muslim in<br />1967.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />******** Christianity gave us respectability, and we became the<br />Nadar people.<br /><br />--------- after becoming christian you still retain the nadar<br />identity.IN TN we have nadar christians,dalit christians,udayar<br />christians....and they have untouchability in churchers,they marry<br />with jathakam and seeing castes etc.<br /><br /><br />******* My questions to Mr. Sudershan and his brigade of Hindu<br />nationalists are:<br /><br />Where were our cultural champions of today's India then?<br /><br />------------ they werent born.<br /><br /><br />***** Will Hindu cultural nationalism mean that we have to go back<br />to our old enslaved cultural ways?<br /><br />------- no<br /><br /><br />******* Since in my present religion I do not have any caste, once<br />you convert me back to Hinduism, will you provide a casteless place?<br /><br />----- you claim to be a nadar christian and say your religion is<br />casteless.Funny,arent you?<br /><br /><br />******** What is Hindutva in reality?<br /><br />------------ are you willing to listen?I can talk for hours on<br />hindutva.<br /><br /><br />****** Why is it important that only Aryan Brahmins should remain at<br />the top of the caste ladder?<br /><br />---------- who said so?<br /><br /><br />******* Why cannot the energy you and your brigade unleash on other<br />religious communities be channelled toward the abolition of the<br />caste system and the peaceful coexistence of all human beings?<br /><br />---------------- we fight to create a discriminationless<br />society.Help us to achieve that goal.Come and become a hindu.Come<br />back to your home,<br /><br />******** I have many more questions to ask. If you can give me and<br />my community clear and satisfactory answers, I, along with my<br />bandwagon, are ready to convert into a Hindu to make your goals a<br />success without bloodshed.<br /><br />----------- ask 1000 questions,awaiting your return to hinduism<br /><br />regards<br />sampath</div>

			<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />Here impression is being created as if group(caste)<br />discrimination existed/exists only in India (hinduism)<br /><br />Even now in England, some of the protestant schools do<br />not admit catholics. There were big fights between<br />these groups. One group could not enter other group's<br />area for some time.<br /><br />In Pak & Iraq, shia & sunny muslims do not interact.<br />Ahmadia group muslims are untouchable by majority Shia<br />& sunny muslims in Pak.<br /><br />Even in our own land, so called christianity have not<br />brought mingling of christian nadars with SC<br />christians. christian nadars consider SC christians as<br />untouchable. There was a procession some years ago in<br />Trichy by SC christians for the maltreatment by church<br />& other christians.<br /><br />If caste abolition is prime objective of christianity,<br />then why they are christian nadars, christian<br />vanniyars,christian pillaimars,SC christians. How<br />church allows this. So castiesm is just a scape goat<br />for conversion. Once he is converted to christianity,<br />church is least bothered about so called " equality"<br /><br />In south Africa, colour discrimination is still there<br />among same religious groups<br /><br />Why a Pope could not come from asia or african<br />countries so far?<br /><br />Bye<br />MA Eswaran<br /><br /><br />________________________________________________________________________<br />Yahoo!

			<div class="content">Again I am wondering, how the westerners and our own people with<br />vested interest have spoiled our minds. Translations for vedas were<br />first written by the westerners. Sanskirt like other language, has<br />words which gives many meanings for the same words. Every sloka can<br />be interpreted in several ways. Westerners took only the wrong<br />meaning and spread it to the uneducated mass only to convert them and<br />still we people are following those bashyams as the original bashyam<br />for vedas.<br /><br />Sampath has thrown much light on this. Cho is writing an article in<br />Tuqlaq titled "Hindu Maha Samudram" which is a must read for all, in<br />which he ponders all these topics. Before three hundered years,<br />people were happy and peaceful without much discrimination. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym>'s<br />Talicheri kalvettu is a standing proof for this. The Tanjai pictures<br />clearly show that even queens did not wear upper garments in those<br />days. We have historic proof for all the equalities we had in the past<br />(again talicheri kalvettu is the standing example where a King<br />respects even the kadai nilai oozhiyan). But only after the europeans<br />entered India all the confusion started. And we got corrupted in our<br />minds and blindly follow what they told to confuse us. This weakness<br />is what they are using for conversion, and thats what I am repeatedly<br />trying to stress.But ....<br /><br />The open letter was funny enough to read. Sampath has torn it apart.<br />Any christian or muslim can very well have written that letter in<br />disguise to tarnish Hindus image? can you prove me wrong??...<br /><br />Sri talks about all the wrong things Manusmrithi talks about..Again I<br />say i have not read manusmrithi. But if at all the scriptures define<br />treatment to different varnas(I dont accept the caste based system,<br />it was only varna dharma), the same scriptures also say that what<br />deed of each varna will lead them to moksha..<br /><br />A brahmin has to get up early, do his daily routines like<br />sandhyavandhanam, do pooja, do yagnja, chant vedas the whole day and<br />should always be doing all these for the welfare of the society. Its<br />scientifically proven what impact the environment has when vedas are<br />chanted and yagams are done. They should not posses any wealth, apart<br />from their next time meal. These rituals will take the whole day and<br />brahmins has to do all this throughout their life to attain moksha.<br />It goes in the descending order and for sudhras its more than enough<br />if they utter the lords name once, just once a day , to attain<br />moksha. Why my dear friend Sri is not looking at this point?<br /><br />Re. Misinterpreation of vedas et all..I read on article written by<br />some vested interest in Islam. It goes like this. We Hindus pray lord<br />shiva in the form of 'Lingam'. We all dont realise the basics behind<br />our religion and thats our weakness. Lingam is called Aroopa Roopam ,<br />the formless form. People like Benny hin will call Hindus as<br />prostitutes because we do Idol worship and the so called seculars<br />will clap happily for this. Hinduism says the higest form of god, the<br />Brahmam does not have any form and Lingam symbolises it. Then why<br />such a semi circular (to some extent) form is given to LIngam?<br />Anywhere in this universe, if we stand in any place and look above<br />us, the area which our eyes can see is only a hemisphere above us and<br />if you can visualise, thats nothing but the form of Lingam and thats<br />why shiva is given that formless form.<br /><br />COming to the article (misinterpreation) I read. It seems Lingam has<br />another meaning in Sanskrit. It denotes the male sexual organ. The<br />article claims that Hindus are perverted and enjoy sexuality and<br />thats why we have given the form of the male sexual organ to our god<br />Shiva. And we happily name our children as Ramalingam(Rama's ----)<br />Sundaralingam (Beautiful ---).. etc. Any sane person who knows about<br />Hinduism will laugh at this. Does this make any sense? Probably for<br />the poeople who go by the western/communist/Dravidian ideologies will<br />accept this and say Hinduism is all bullshit..<br /><br />Dr.Sri, whatever you quote about manusmrithi or the discrimination<br />among the people refered in the scriptures etc. only reminded me of<br />the above said artilce. I dont want to write this, but I needed an<br />example to clear some of the misinterpreation you have. Any person<br />who is against hinduism could have written the bashyam for the<br />scripts which you could have read. That doesnt make the end of it.<br />Thats what I repeatedly say, we have brains to think and we should<br />think logically. Stray incidents do not make what Hinduism actually<br />is. Please Please Please try to understand this.<br /><br />I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet policy<br />prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the<br />news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling(probably<br />adhamgam towards our religion) you have towards Hinduism is by<br />reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how far<br />media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in<br />Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu, misquoted<br />Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass who<br />read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go and<br />tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have witnessed<br />it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for an<br />article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe<br />article was published, whatever I said was published as told by my<br />classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if I<br />told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media plays<br />with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them to<br />be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case, the<br />entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but whenthe<br />Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and when<br />the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up with<br />a case where there is not even a single evidence against the acharya<br />in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the mindset<br />of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely think<br />wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should<br />remember that our countries media is in the hands of the communist<br />and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will<br />publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing example<br />how our religion is targeted by the christians(its said that foreing<br />missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because Jeyendrar<br />is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop conversion.)<br /><br />As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely is<br />good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through<br />coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass and<br />look at the facts<br /><br />The entire mail is not intended for a single person called Sri, but<br />to the entire group and if possible to the entire world. -:)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satsih</div>
