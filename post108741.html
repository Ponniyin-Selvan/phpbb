			<div class="content">Mouli,<br /><br />I am no expert, but still putting forth my thoughts.<br />We had a discussion on 'UTHAMA'. Some said its tamil and others said<br />Sanskrit. Though its Sanksrit, many think its tamil because of its<br />common usage. So common people do not know the difference between<br />languages is my humble opinion. Commonly used words are common among<br />common people and thats why its common (visu nyabagam varudha).<br /><br />Even today, govt letter heads will have the title and other top<br />portion of the letter head printed in English, but the actual content<br />of the letter can be in Tamil. Why? Do you have an answer? If yes, the<br />same applies to epigraph as well. even if you dont have an answer, the<br />same applies to epigraph <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> (cha enakku theriyalangaratha eppadi poosi<br />mozhuga vendiyirukku)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Satish<br /> <br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>--- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "chandramouli" <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    That&#39;s a valid point Satish.

The Tiruvalangadu plates(5. <br />South Indian Inscriptions Vol. III Part III nÂº 205, p. 383-439, <br />Madras, 1920.) issued in his sixth year, and the Karandai copper <br />plates issued in his 8th year are the two charters of this ruler <br />found earlier. The Karandai plates(6. K. G. Krishnan, Karandai Tamil <br />Sangam plates of Rajendra Chola I, Memoirs of the Archaeological <br />Survey of India, NÂº 79, New Delhi, 1984.) is by far the biggest <br />royal charter to have been found inscribed on copper sheets-anywhere <br />in India. It records the creation of a brahmadeya and gift of lands <br />to 1080 Brahminds. Both the Tiruvalangadu and Esalam grants, relate <br />to the gift of devatana taxes to temples and hence would fall under <br />the same class of grants. Interestingly both were found within the <br />temples and along with bronze images. Obviously both were buried in <br />troubed times to safeguard the bronzes and the charters. The larger <br />Leiden grant(7.Epigraphia Indica XXII, p. 213.) was made by Rajaraja <br />Cola but issued by Rajendra; with that, the total number would be <br />four. <br />The Eslam grant is interessting as it refers to the construction of <br />the temple by Rajendra's Rajaguru and was found in the same temeple <br />premises. The village was a suburb of Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam <br />(Ennayiram) where Rajendra established one of the biggest vedic <br />colleges. Nearby is Brahmadesam where there are Chola temples. The <br />importance of the place,and what prompted the Rajaguru to select <br />this place,and other problems deserve special study which we propose <br />to take up later. <br />The charter consists of fifteen copper sheets engraved on both <br />sides, fastened to a ring, which is sealed at the mouth with the <br />royal insignia of emperor Rajendra Cola (Ph.16 and 17). The whole <br />charer is intacat without any damage, except the last sheet which is <br />slightly broken at the bottom in a corner. A very insignificant <br />breakage is also noticed in the last but one sheet. Since the last <br />sheet has been bearing the weight during its burial and handling, it <br />shows faint tearing near the ring hole and a hair line crack below. <br />Otherwise the charter is in a very good state of preservation. <br />MEASUREMENTS Plates: length : 34.0 cm. breadth : 16.5 cm. <br />thickness : 4.0 cm. Ring: diameter : 34.0 cm. thickness : 2.0 cm. <br />Seal: diameter : 13.5 cm. <br />The plates are numbered serially (Ph.18 to 47). The charter is in <br />two parts, the first part in Sanskrit and the second part in Tamil. <br />The Sanskrit part covering three plates and a part of the front page <br />of the fourth plate is written in grantha characters, while the <br />Tamil part is in Tamil letters of the Cola age. <br />A. THE ENGRAVER <br />The care with which the charter is engraved shows that it is the <br />work of a royal scribe. The Sanskrit part of the grant gives the <br />name of the engraver as Ulakalanta-chola Acaryan. The inscription of <br />the seal is also in grantha characters and is preserved in excellent <br />condition. The engraving on the plates is uniformly good except at a <br />few places. <br />The Karandai plates of Rajendra was engraved by different persons <br />whose names are given as Tribhuvanamadevi Peracarya and <br />Rajendrasimha Peracarya. The Tiruvalangadu plates were engraved by <br />four acarya-s,three of whom were also the engravers of Larger Leiden <br />grant of Rajendra.Two amongst them were the engravers of Karandai <br />plate. The engraver of the Esalam plate is different whose name was <br />Ulagalanta Acari. <br />The name Vasudeva occurs at the end of the Sanskrit part of the <br />Esalam plate. A certain Vasudevan, son of Krishnan, is known among <br />the family of engravers (K.G.K.P. 54) but he had the title Rajaraja <br />peracaryan who was one of the engravers of Leiden plates. It is <br />difficult to say whether the engraver of Esalam plates is identical <br />with or related to Vasudevan of Leiden grant. Sri Krishnan holds <br />that the word kastakari ascribed to the engravers in the Karandai <br />plates indicates that they were carpenters by <br />profession. "Kashtakari" is a Sanskrit coinage of the word "taksaka" <br />tacca) which actually means silpin-s and no carpenters. Several <br />inscriptions use this term "kashtakari",in the sense of sthapathi-s, <br />silpin-s, architects. Krishnan's view needs to be revised. Silpin-s <br />of great accomplishment were in the employ of the kings to engrave <br />their royal charters. <br />B. THE POET-COMPOSER The Sanskrit portion of the Esalam grant was <br />composed by poet Narayana Kavi, son of Sankara, a resident of <br />Parsvagrama. It is the same poet who composed the Tiruvalangadu and <br />Karandai plates of Rajendra. K. G. Krishnan suggests that the same <br />Narayana was also the composer of Larger Leiden Grants (P. 53) which <br />is not unlikely. It is clear that almost from the 5th year of <br />Rajendra to his 25th year, this poet has been occupying an important <br />position in the court of Rajendra Cola. One of the verses found in <br />the Karandai plates is verbatim used in the Esalam plates. <br />Krishnan's identification of the village Parsvagrama with the <br />village Kottaiyur a nearby (Parsvagrama) of the lands gifted in <br />Karandai plates, needs revision in the light of this grant. C. <br />AJNAPTI The anjapti of this Esalam grant was Narakkan Marayan <br />Jananathan alias Rajendra Cola Brahmamarayan. In the Sanskrit <br />portion he is called Jananatha, son of Raman. The Karandai plates <br />mention the very same Jananatha as mantrin, minister, to king <br />Rajendra, and was the vijnapti of that grant. Obviously he occupied <br />this high post under Rajendra from his 8th year to his 25th year. He <br />was one of the sons of Krishnan Raman, who was called Rajendra Cola <br />Brahmamarayan. Krsnan Raman from the same village- -Keralantaka <br />caturvedi-mangalam, in Vennadu, in Uyyakondar valanadu, was the <br />commander in chief of Rajaraja. He erected the enclosure to the <br />great temple at Tanjore. He had the title Mummudicola Brahmamarayan. <br />It is obvious that he served under Rajendra as well. Probably he was <br />conferred another title-Rajendra Chola Brahmadirayan, in the reign <br />of Rajendra. He served as olainayakan in the Karandai grant. <br />Marayan Jananathan, the ajnapti of this grant, was one of his sons. <br />This Jananatha also served as "Karmam arayum" in the Karandai grant. <br />A certain Narakkan Raman Arulmoli of the same village served as <br />Danda-nayaka (commander) under Rajaraja I. He was probably another <br />son of Raman, as his name indicates. Both father (Raman) and son <br />(Arulmoli) served as commanders under Rajaraja I. <br />It is also clear from these records, that the commanders under the <br />Chola emperors, also held the posts of mantrin-s (ministers) and <br />olainayakam and karmadhikari (executives), simultaneously. <br />D. RAJAGURU Isanasiva Pandita, served as Rajaguru of Rajendra Chola, <br />during his sixth regnal year. He gifted money for burning camphor to <br />the main deity in the Great temple of Tanjore during daily worship <br />and also during the great annual festivals. The gifts of the royal <br />guru is recorded in the 6th year of Rajendra Cola I. This guru <br />Isanasiva Pandita was the Rajaguru for Rajaraja Chola I, earlier. He <br />gifted the copper stupi kalasa-s (sacred stupi), the finials, to be <br />placed on the parivara shrines during the 29th year of the king. The <br />inscription recording these gifts (no. 90 of S.I.I. II.) <br />specifically mentions, that Isanasiva Pandita was the Gurukkal of <br />Rajaraja, "Udaiyar Rajarajadevar Gurukkal Isanasiva Panditar". <br />In the same great temple of Tanjore, a 19th year record of Rajendra <br />Cola refers to Sarvasiva Pandita as the Rajaguru of Rajendra Chola. <br />The king himself mentions specifically that Sarvasiva Pandita was <br />his guru as "Nam Udaiyar Sarvasiva Pandita". This preceptor was <br />given the Acaryabhogam in the temple of Rajarajesvaram at Tanjore. <br />It was stipulated that only his disciples and grand disciples, <br />hailing from Aryadesa, Madhyadesa and Gaudadesa and who were duly <br />qualified were entitled to receive the preceptor's share of 2000 <br />kalam-s of paddy, annually. This gift of endowment was to be <br />protected by the Saiva acarya-s of this line. Hultzsch editing this <br />inscription held (vide his foot note on page 109) that Isanasiva <br />Pandita and Sarvasiva Pandita were perhaps identical. But they <br />should be considered two different guru-s, Sarvasiva succeeding <br />Isanasiva to become the guru of Rajendra Cola sometimes after his <br />sixth year (1018 A.D.). The earlier guru acted as Rajaguru under <br />Rajaraja till Rajaraja's death and continued to be the guru of <br />Rajendra also. Propably after Isanasiva's death, Sarvasiva became <br />his guru. <br />The Tanjore inscription referring to the gift of copper finials to <br />the subsidiary shrines of the Tanjore temple by Isanasiva in the <br />29th year Rajaraja Cola, also mentions a certain Pavana Pidaran as <br />the Saivacarya of the Tanjore temple. He made the gift of one <br />finial, in the 3rd year of Rajendra (1015 A.D.). The editors of <br />S.I.I. II 2nd part, suggested that Pavana Pidara was succeeded by <br />Sarvasiva Pandita in the office of the Saivacarya of the temple. But <br />the inscription seems to indicate that the two were different. <br />Pavana Pidars is mentioned as Saivaacarya of the <br />temple, "Rajarajesvaram Udaiyar Saivacaryan Pavana Pidaran". Whereas <br />the inscription referring to Sarvasiva Pandita mentions his as <br />the 'lord' of the king Nam "Udaiyar Sarvasiva Pandita" meaning that <br />the king was his servant. Pavana Pidara should have been a <br />worshipping priest in the great temple and a disciple of Isanasiva. <br />It is this Sarvasiva Pandita, the royal preceptor of Rajendra, who <br />built the Esalam temple. As the gift of Esalam temple was to take <br />effect from the 15th year of the king, 1027 A.D., it may be surmised <br />the temple was completed in that year. Sarvasiva Pandita ought to <br />have become the Rajaguru before the year 1025 A.D. Sri K. G. <br />Krishnan in his 'Karandai Tamil Sangam Plates of Rajendra'(p. 30) <br />holds the Anbil plates of Sundara Cola as the earliest Cola plates. <br />This is wrong for the so called 'Udayendiram plates of Prthvipati' <br />is a misnomer, as has been shown by me (Tirurttani and Velanjeri <br />copper plates - p. 27). In both the Sanskrit and Tamil portion, the <br />donor of the Udayendiram plates was king Parantaka Chola, who issued <br />the grant in his 15th regnal year, Ganga Prthvipati appppearing as <br />Vijnapti. <br />Among the Cola copper plates, the Tiruvalangadu copper plates of <br />Rajendra Cola, deserve special attention as that was also issued for <br />assigning the dues from a village to the temple of Tiruvalangadu <br />Udaiyar at Palaiyanur. The other charters were issued for different <br />purposes. <br />This copper plate uses terms vyavastai and pariharam in their <br />specific legal meaning. The permissions granted and prohibitions <br />imposed are called "vyavastai", while exemptions to pay taxes into <br />royal treasury, is mentioned as "parihara". The Karandai plates also <br />make this specific distinction, but earlier plates like the <br />Velanjeri plates list both--permission(and prohibition) and <br />exemptions under "parihara". <br />Regarding Rajaraja-catur-vedimangalam, Sri S. R. Balasubramaniam, <br />holds "that the area formed by the triangle joining Villupuram, <br />Tindivanam and Gingee would apppear to have constituted roughly the <br />Taniyur of Rajaraja-caturvedi-manganal" (Middle Chola Temples p. <br />150). But from the present record it is seen that Rajaraja-cutervedi-<br />mangalam was much smaller, and to its South was the Jananatha-<br />caturvedi-mangalam. Sri S.R. Balasubramaniam, citing ARE Reports, <br />held that this temple of Ramesvara at Esalam was built by Somasiva <br />Pandita, the guru of Rajendra Cola (M.c. Temples p. 158). But this <br />record clearly shows the name of the builder of this temple and the <br />guru of Rajendra as Sarvasiva Pandita and not Somasiva Pandita. <br />There is an obvious error in the reading of the ARE. <br />E. THE SEAL The royal seal of this copper plate charter is preserved <br />remarkably well (Ph. 17). It shows the seated tiger and two fish in <br />the centre placed on a bow, representing the emblems of the Chola-s, <br />the Pandya-s and the Chera-s respectively. Behind the tiger are in a <br />row, lamp on stand, a sword placed vertically on its handle, an <br />arrow (?) a spear and an ankusa. On the other side behind the fish <br />are shown a lamp on stand, a sword, a spear, an arrow and a parasu. <br />Above these emblems, is shown the royal parasol flanked by fly-<br />whisks (cauri). Further up are seen, a svastika, a cakra and an <br />indistinguishable object. The last one is also found on the Karandai <br />seal and also on the Tiruvalangadu seal, where however it is clearly <br />identified as an opened lotus. Beneath the bow are seen a seat on a <br />tripod, a board and an entrance torana. <br />It would be interesting to notice the significance of these emblems. <br />The cakra which tops the parasol and all other emblems, is the sign <br />of a Cakravartin. This emblem is not found in the Karandai or <br />Tiruvalangadu seals. Obviously Rajendra has completed all his <br />conquests when this seal was issued in his 25th year which included <br />conquests of gangetic plain and overseas territories, and he has <br />felt the power of Cakravartin which he sought to symbolise in his <br />seal. The boar, is the emblem of the Calukya-s -who were conquered <br />again and again by the Chola-s. The Pandya-s represented by fish, <br />the Chera-s by their bow, and the Calukya-s by their boar, were <br />subdued and brought under the rule of the Chola-s as shown by the <br />umbrella under which protection, all were brought. <br />The cauri, the svastika and the flower are auspicious symbols, which <br />occur in another seal of Rajendra as well. The significance of the <br />tripod seat is uncertain. The emblem of an entrance with festoons is <br />noticed for the first time in this seal; Rajendra during his <br />conquest of the Srivijaya and Kadara countries captured and brought <br />as war trophy--the Vidyadhara torana of Kadara ruler, Sri Mara <br />Vijayottunga-varman. Obviously it is the capture of this torana, <br />mentioned significantly in his records, which is also figured on <br />this seal. <br />The seal bears on its periphery Rajendra Chola's well known sasana. <br />Rajad-rajanya-makuta-sreni-ratnesu sasanam, Etad Rajendra Colasya <br />parakesarivarmanah. <br />F. THE SANSKRIT PART OF THE GRANT The Sanskrit part of the charter <br />gives in brief the geneology of Rajendra Chola, the construction of <br />the Ramesvara temple at Eydar (modern Esalam) by the royal guru <br />Sarvasiva and the gift of land by emperor Rajendra Chola. It also <br />mentions the poet who composed the prasasti and the scribe who <br />inscribed the plates. <br />The plate begins with two benedictory stanzas, the first in prise of <br />Siva in his Kalyanasundara aspect "Let Bhavanipati who has obtained <br />in marriage Bhavani, and who bears appropriate ornaments on his body-<br />the shining eyes on his face as a tilaka, the kalakuta poison on his <br />throat like a moistened Nilotpala flower, and on the head the digit <br />of the moon as the cudamani jewel, give us prosperity". The second <br />verse addressed to goddess Sarasvati is interesting. <br />It says "Oh! Goddess Sarasvati! You alone should come to my rescue, <br />and bestow grace on me. The good qualities of the rulers of this <br />Solar race are indeed innumerable. How can I describe all their <br />qualities with these limited number of letters which are only fifty <br />in numbers ( vowels and consonants put together).". <br />Then begins the legendary geneaology of the Chola-s, with Surya-<br />(Saptasapti) followed vby Manu, Ikshvaku, Mandhata, Mucukunda and <br />another ruler Valabha. This ruler is said to have established <br />Valabhapuri. It is not known which city is alluded to here; Is it <br />Vallam near Tanjore? Then the first king of the dynasty is mentioned <br />as Cholavarma. He was followed by rulers named Rajakesari and <br />Parakesari. Then is listed Karikala, who is said to have got the <br />embankments to the Kaveri built by the vanquished kings. <br />After Karikala, the plate gives the name of Vijayalaya, who obtained <br />unequalled royal power (Rajyalaksmi). His son Aditya, was an abode <br />of scholars and made the world follow righteous path. His son was <br />Parantaka (I), who was a veritable bee in the lotus feet of the Lord <br />Tripurantaka Siva (Puradvish) who made the temple of the Lord of <br />Silver mountain (Kailasa), the golden shrine at Vyaghragrahara <br />(Chidambaram). From Parantaka was born Arindama (conqueror of <br />enemies) bearing the name--appropriate to his valour. To him was <br />born Parantaka (II) who was also a bee in the lotus feet of Siva <br />Purantaka. To him was born Arumolivarma, who with his long and <br />beautiful arms bore the marks of sankha and cakra in his palms. He <br />conquered the Ganga-s, Vanga-s, Kalinga-s, Magadha-s, Malava-s, <br />Simhala-s, Andhra-s, Ratta-s (Rastrakuta-s) Odda-s (Orissans), <br />Kataha-s, Kerala-s, Gauda-s and Pandya-s. By the wealth obtained <br />through his conquests he erected at Tanjanagari (Tanjore) a very <br />great temple (atyuttamam) named Rajarajesvaram. <br />Rajaraja's brother was Karikala Chola, who by his valour, conquered <br />the Pandya ruler in battle, severed his head, and placed it on top <br />of the pole at the entrance of Tanjore.(8. One of the important <br />event in the history of the Chola-s, that has attracted lively <br />debate, is the term "Virapandyan talai konda". In a fierc battle at <br />Cevvur, the Pandya ruler Vira Pandya and Aditya Karikala, fought a <br />bloody battle. Aditya is given the title "Virapandyan Talai KondaI". <br />Commenging on this Prof. K.A.N. Sastri, says "The Thiruvalangadu <br />plates make an express declaration that Aditya II killed Vira Pandya <br />and brought his severed head to the Chola capital. Even here the <br />lateness of the testimony throws suspicion on the event" (P. 144) <br />Continuing his comments Prof. Sastri says--"Aditya's heroism was <br />probably exhibited in the field of Cevvur to the south of Sevali <br />hills, the Southern boundary of Pudukkottai and the battle must have <br />furnished the occasion for his claim that he took the head of Vira <br />Pandya. The Leyden grant does not state, like the Tiruvalangadu <br />plates, that Virapandya was killed by Aditya and it is possible that <br />the composer of the Thiruvalangadu plates struck by the forcible <br />simile, in the Leyden grant, embellished the account of Aditya's <br />Contest, with Vira Pandya and his account of Aditya's rule adds <br />nothing else to what we learn from the earlier grant. The chances <br />are that after the battle of Cevvur in which Vira Pandya sustained a <br />bad defeat the chola forces, lead among others by Parantaka Siriya <br />velar of Kodumbalur, continued the campaign into the Pandya country <br />and forced Vira Pandya to seek refuge in the forests" (p. 154) <br />Sastri doubted the killing of Vira Pandya and held that the <br />term "Pandyan Talai Konda" should be taken not as killing Pandya, <br />but defeating him in the battle. The present Esalam grant puts an <br />end to this debate by stating that Aditya not only killed Vira <br />Pandya in the battle, but also brought his severed head to Tanjore <br />and had it exhibited spiked onto a pillar in front of the gate. He <br />protected the world as a boy. <br />Then was born Madhurantaka, who wanted to re-establish on earth <br />auspicious path of scriptures that has slipped owing to the power of <br />Kali. He, Rajendra Chola, shone as the veritable abode of beauty, <br />valour and intellect, the very main spring of compassion, and the <br />home of all knowledge, He is said to have made the world happy. <br />Among his exploits the following are mentioned. 1. He conquered the <br />Chalukya ruler Jayasimha. <br />2. He brought the pure water of Ganges to his country and surpassed <br />Bhagiratha in this effort. <br />3. This Rajendra established the Gangaikondacholapuri after his name <br />and built a great temple also named after him, to Lord Mahesvara out <br />of great devotion. He was deeply attached to the lotus feet of that <br />Lord like a bee ever humming over the Parijata flower. <br />A certain teacher named Sarvasiva Arya equal to Sarva, and a master <br />of all agama-s was the preceptor of this Madhurantaka, the very <br />abode of arts and good qualities. To this Cakravartin Rajendra, <br />saluted by the resplendent crowns of opponent kings, this very <br />Mahesvara served as the guru. <br />There exists a great mangalam named Rajaraja- caturved-imangalam in <br />Jayamkonda-chola-mandalam. At Eydar, a suburb of the above agrahara, <br />this guru built a Siva temple to Ramesvara. Lord siva, having left <br />his residence of Kailasa and other sacred abodes, took his seat in <br />this temple built by this guru with devotion. <br />Madhurantaka, the son of Rajaraja Chola, while residing at Kanchi in <br />the beautiful mahasala, gifted wealth to Brahmins. With due respect <br />and devotion to his guru, he gifted a land for the worship of Siva <br />of Ramesvara temple. He ordered his subordinates to demarcate the <br />land. Two villages, Nannadu and Erpakkam in Panaiyur-nadu were <br />united into single village and renamed Vikrama-cholanallur, and <br />gifted tax free to Lord Siva. The order of the king was inscribed in <br />the tax register in his 25th year. The boundaries of the village <br />were marked by the king's officers and the representatives of the <br />territories. This guru himself was the vijnapti. A certain <br />Jananatha, son of Raman was the ajnapti of the grant. A certain poet <br />Narayana, son of Sankara, a resident of Parsvagrama, composed this <br />sasana. This prasasti was written by Ulakalantacola Acaryan. <br />I had the privilege of showing the copper plates to the Sri Kanchi <br />Kamakoti Pithadhipati Paramacarya Candrasekharendra Sarasvati <br />Svamigal. The Paramacarya not only went through the entire <br />transcript of the copper plate prepared by me, but also read the <br />original copper plates-especially the Sanskrit part, and pointed out <br />corrections to some of my readings. In his inmitable style the <br />Acarya remarked that while Tamil letters have undergone evolution <br />through the centuries, the Grantha script has remained unchanged <br />from the Chola times. The Paramacarya, even before reading the <br />transcript and the plates, told me about a verse he has learnt from <br />his teacher, which is of great value to the present copper plate <br />charter. The Acarya said that he learnt the following verse from his <br />teacher (whose name was mentioned to me by the Bala Periyaval as <br />Samivadyar who served as a teacher to Paramacarya for sometime). <br />Patrakalitavedanam sastramarganusarinam Etad va arikalasya <br />karikalasya sasanam. <br />According to Paramacarya, the above verse is said to have been found <br />in an inscription at Tiruvidaimarudur in Tanjore district, but is <br />yet to be verified. The Tiruvidaimarudur temple which yielded over <br />100 inscriptions, was renovated towards the beginning of this <br />century, and all these inscriptions have been lost. However the <br />Acarya said that though the verse reads simple, it is difficult to <br />interpret its meaning. The meaning according to the Acarya's teacher <br />was;--Akalitavedanam patr i.e. the protector of vedic scholars; <br />amarganu-sarinam sastr i.e. the punisher of those who swerve from <br />the righteous path. The rest of the portion means that it is the <br />royal order of Karikala, the death to enemies. Obviously this might <br />have been found on the royal seal of the famous Cola ruler Karikala, <br />preserved to us only in tradition. We are beholden to the <br />Paramacarya, for this very valuable information. When the <br />Paramacarya read the Sanskrit part of this charter, he was happy to <br />note one verse in the charter, which has made use of the same <br />phrase: Arikala to denote Karikala. <br />The Junior Pontiff, who evinced very great interest in the content <br />of the copper plate charter, informed me of another tradition which <br />needs to be recorded here. In these copper plates (as in other <br />earlier charters) it is stated that when the king's order arrived at <br />the village, the Nattar got up in reverence, placed it on their <br />head, and went in procession to demarcate the boundaries. <br />The Junior Pontiff--Sri Sankara Vijayendra Sarasvati told me that <br />even today this tradition is observed. A day prior to the Vyasa <br />Puja, a Srimukham is issued annually by the Kanchi mutt which used <br />to be read at the gopura of the Kamaksi temple in Kanchi, when the <br />leading citizens of Kanchi assembled. The Srimukham contains the <br />prasasti of the Kanchi mutt. Then the Srimukkham is placed on a <br />palanquin, and is taken around the main streets of Kanchi to the <br />accompaniment of music and chants. It is interesting to note that <br />this Srimukham, of the spiritual order of Kanchi mutt, is <br />acknowledged by the Kanchi citizens. <br />G. THE TAMIL PORTION The Tamil portion of the record which runs into <br />349 lines of writing on the plates should be studied in several <br />parts. King's order The first part relates to king's order. The <br />Tamil part of the charter, (1. 80) after the word Svasti Sri, begins <br />with the word Konerinmai Kondan, a conventional method of indicating <br />that is the king's own order. The gift was made by the king while he <br />was in the bathing hall of his palace at Kanchipuram, a nagaram in <br />Eyilkottam (86) of Jayankonda- cholamandalam. The gift was made in <br />the tenth day of 24th regnal year of the king, (85) but was to take <br />effect from the 15th regnal year itself (1. 126). This indicates <br />obviously the date of construction of the Ramisvarar temple at <br />Esalam, by the guru of the emperor. <br />The order of the king was addressed to: (a) The Nattar-s of Panaiyur <br />Nadu in Jayamkonda- cholamandalam (the territory in which the gifted <br />land was situated ) (1. 87) <br />(b) The villagers of i. Brahmadeyas ii. Devatanas iii. Palliccandams <br />iv. Kani Murruttus v. Vettapperus vi. Old Arac-cala-bhoga and <br />(c) The Nagarattar <br />A new village under the name Vikrama-chola-nallur was constituted by <br />uniting two villages, Nan-nadu and Er-pakkam that formed part of <br />Rajaraja- carupedi- mangalam and Jananatha-carupedi-mangalam in <br />Panaiyur-nadu (87-89). Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam is mentioned as <br />Taniyur. The Royal Order mentions the total area covered by the <br />newly constituted village, Vikrama-chola-nallur and details <br />individually the area covered by temples, irrigation canals, lakes, <br />grazing grounds, residential areas, cemetery etc. and also wet and <br />dry lands.I list below for conveniencene details of land <br />measurements leaving out minute subdivisions. <br />(1) The total area occupied by the village was 109 veli and 10 1/2 <br />ma (91) <br />(2) Out of this total area the following public lands have to be <br />deducted <br />i. Residential area of the village--3 veli & 6 ma (93) ii. Drinking <br />water tanks, its embankment and feeder canal-1 veli 3/4 ma (94) iii. <br />Irrigation Canals--3 veli 7 1/2 ma (95) iv. The rivulets Cirraru and <br />Manimuttaru feeding the lake in Jananatha-caturvedi-mangalam--4 veli <br />16 ma (95) v. The temple of Sri Tali Mahadeva of this village, its <br />yeard and flower garden--4 ma (101) vi. Padariyar temple and its <br />front yard--1 ma (102). vii. Aiyyanar temple and its open yard <br />(104). viii. The flower garden of Sri Ramisvara temple in Eydar, a <br />hamlet of Rajaraja-caturvedi-mantalam--13 ma (107). ix. Artisan's <br />hamlet (Kammanac-ceri)-3 ma (108) x. Paraicceri--ma (109) xi. <br />Grazing ground--2 veli 1 ma (110) xii. Cremation ground--3 ma (111) <br />xiii. The lake of Jananatha-caturvedimangalam--1 veli 6 ma (112) <br />xiv. Alkaline land and brakish land--10 1/2 ma (113) <br />All these lands put together measuring 18 veli 16 ma area are to be <br />excluded from the total area (115). <br />The rest forming:- a) Lake and lift irrigated wet lands raising two <br />crops a year, measuring 8 veli b) Lake irrigated wet lands raising <br />one crop a year 59 veli 5 1/2 ma (118-119) and c) Dry lands raising <br />grains like varagu, ellu, kollu and tuvarai 23 veli 10 ma (120-125). <br />A total of 90 veli 18 ma lands paid 3400 kalam-s of paddy as tax <br />from the 15th regnal year. Annual tax (126-132) This 3,400 kalam-s <br />of paddy has been fixed as annual land-dues in perpetuity (kanik-<br />kadan, nirr-irai) and should be measured to Lord Mahadeva of the <br />stone temple, Tiruramisvaram, erected by our Lord (guru) Sarvasiva <br />Panditar at Eydar, a hamlet of Rajaraja-carupedi-mangalam, a taniyur <br />in Panaiyur Nadu. The land dues should be used for the nibandha-<br />approved expenses of the temple. The king ordered that the land <br />should be entered in the registers as devatana. <br />The tittu That the order of the king was committed to writing by an <br />officer of the king and compared by four officers, forms the second <br />section of the charter (132-143). A certain Mummodi-cholan, the <br />royal scribe (olai eludum) wrote down the order. The names of the <br />four officers are 1. Cavur Paranjoti--alias Rajendra-cholak-kon 2. <br />Kovan-accan alias Gangaikonda-chola Animuri Nadalvan 3. Narakkan <br />Marayan alias Uttama-chola Brahmamarayan 4. Narayanan Eduttapadam <br />alias Uttama-chola Colakkon. <br />All the above four officers were holding the post of olai nayakan. <br />This order was communicated, and ordered to be written down in the <br />Central Secretariat by Narakkan Marayan alias Jananathan Rajendra <br />chola Brahmadhirajan. He is identical with the Ajnapti Jananatha, a <br />son of Raman mentioned in the Sanksrit portion. As per his orders, <br />the detailed draft was prepared by a further group officers. I list <br />below only the names of the official posts and the number of <br />officers under each (144-185). 1. Udankuttattu [nam] karmam arayum 2 <br />Officers 2. Naduvirukkum 1 Officers 3. Vidaiyil nam karuman arayum 6 <br />Officers 4. Naduvirukkum 1 Officer These officers drafted the order. <br />5. Puravuvari tinaikkalattu kankani 2 Officers 6. Puravuvari <br />tinaikkalam 3 Officers 7. Varippottakam 2 Officers 8. Mukavetti 3 <br />Officers 9. Varippottakakkanakku 1 Officers 10. Variyilidu 2 <br />Officers 11. Pattolai 2 Officers The above officers were present and <br />got the tittu entered in the tax register on the 76th day of the <br />24th year (186). As we have seen earlier, the king issued the order <br />on the 10th day of he 24th year. It has taken sixty six days for the <br />details to be entered at the central Secretariat. <br />Further these king's personal staff directed three officers with the <br />insctructions to demarcate the boundaries by conducting an elephant <br />around the newly constituted village, Vikmachola-nallur, consisting <br />of Nan-nadu and Erpakkam, which were separated from Rajaraja-<br />caturvedi-mangalam, a taniyur in Panaiyur-nadu, and Jananatha-<br />caturvedi-mangalam in Vavalur-nadu. The three officers who were so <br />directed were Enban Puran of Uduttur, who was a kankani and Revenue <br />administrator of that territory-Panaiyurnadu. The other two were <br />Puravu-vari tinaik-kalam (192). (1)Arangan Paniccai of Kaniccaip-<br />pakkam in Anmur-nadu in Tirumunaip-padi, and (2) Sri Krsna Pattan of <br />Kanderu, in Vanavanmadevi- caturvedi-mangalam in Kumilnadu in <br />Anmurkottam (195). <br />The villagers of Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam and Jananatha-caturvedi-<br />mangalam were directed to accompany the above officers, demarcate <br />the boundaries by conducting an elephant carrying flags, plant <br />stones and milk bushes and draft the 'gift-deed', ara olai. (197). <br />As per the above order, the following 'gift-deed' was drafted by the <br />two villagers and the above mentioned officers. <br />The tirumungam (Royal Order)(232-246). Here, on line 198, begins the <br />usual prasasti of Rajendracola, found in all his inscriptions <br />beginning with the words Tirumannivalara. In the Karandai plates <br />this prasasti stops with "Parasuraman mevarun cantimat-tivu Aran <br />karudiruttiya cemportiru tagu mudiyum mapperum tandar konda <br />parakesari varman" (lines 377-378). The Tamil prasasti of Karandai <br />plates does not refer to the conquest upto Gangetic plains. Nor does <br />it refer to the conquest of Kadara. But the Sanskrit portion of the <br />same charter refers to the conquest of Kadara, Calukya, Jayasimha <br />etc. It may be recalled that the Karandai plates were issued in the <br />8th year of the king's reign in 1020 A.D. whereas the Esalam plates <br />were issued in the 24th year and inscribed in his 25th year (1.232). <br />The Tamil portion of Esalam plates give the full details of his <br />conquest as found in the fuller prasasti found in a number of Tamil <br />inscriptions of the king. As this part is well known is not <br />discussed in detail here. <br />The next part, being the continuation of the prasasti, is called the <br />tirumugam dated in the 55th day of 25th year-written by <br />Tirumandiravolai Namban Pahaiyadakki of Mattur in Vilainadu in <br />Uyyakkondar valanadu (232-246). This was compared by four officers: <br />1. Savur Paranjoti--alias Rajendracholakkon. 2. Kovanaccan alias <br />Gangaikondachola animurti Nadalvan 3. Narakkan Marayan Arulmoli, <br />alias Uttamachola Brahmamarayan. and 4. Narayanan Eduttapadam alias <br />Uttamachola Colakkon <br />The record then details the boundaries of the two villages marked by <br />circumambulation. <br />Boundaries (247-286) The boundaries of both Nannadu and Erpakkam <br />each separately are then detailed. In both the cases, it is seen <br />that the marking begins at the North-eastern corner of the village <br />and passes down South, West and North and is ended at the starting <br />point. It is also seen, that banks of canals, rivulets, mounds, <br />anthills, boundaires of lands and villages are mentioned as <br />prominent identifiable marks. From the description of the <br />boundaries, it may be seen that Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam was <br />situated in the North and Jananathacaturvedimangalam in the South, <br />both separated by an irrigation canal, named Raja-culamani-vaykkal. <br />The village Tiruvamattur was situated to the West of Jananatha-<br />caturvedi-mangalam. The full boundaries are not translated in this <br />essay, but it is proposed to give only the salient features. <br />There was a lake in the North of the Jananatha- cataurvedimangalam. <br />It was called Vadakkil eri.e. the northern lake. This lake was fed <br />by a rivulet called Cirraru, and also a canal, the name of which is <br />not mentioned. In Jananatha-caturvedi-mangalam there were two <br />irrigation canals; one called Nigarili-chola vaykkal, obviously <br />named after Rajaraja Chola, and the other named Rajendra Cola <br />vaykkal after Rajendra. A Jayamkonda-chola-vadi is also mentioned. <br />The tirumugam was approved and sent to the Nattar. It is interesting <br />to mention that the king's first order regarding the grant was <br />written by Singanai Mummudi-cholan and compared by four officers. <br />The second part-i.e. tirumugam was writrten by a different person, <br />Namban Pahaiyadakki holding the office of Tirumandira olai. But this <br />part was also compared by the same four officers who compared <br />earlier the king's order. <br />The Territorial Assembly Acts. ARA-OLAI (287-295) The territorial <br />assembly, on seeing the arrival of the tirumugam, got up, welcomed <br />the same with reverence, paid obeissance to it, and carrying it on <br />their head, identified and marked the boundaries, circumambulated <br />with the elephant carrying flags, planted stones and milk bushes and <br />drafted the gift deed, (ara olai). The two villages- Rajaraja- <br />caturvedi-mangalam, a taniyur in Panaiyur-nadu, and Jananatha-<br />caturvedi-mangalam in Vavalur-nadu, surveyed separately, the two <br />hamlets Nan-nadu and Erpakkam, clubbed them together as one village <br />and gave it a new name Vikrama-cholanallur. It was ordered (by entry <br />in tax register) that the taxes should be paid for <br />meeting"stipulated expenses" in connection with the worship <br />(nibandha) to the Lord Mahadeva, the presiding deity of the Stone <br />temple Tiruramisvaram, constructed by the revered Sarvasiva Pandita <br />at Eydar, a hamlet of Rajaraja- caturvedi- mangalam, a taniyur i.e. <br />independent village, in Panaiyur-nadu. <br />It is also learnd from this record that the following temples were <br />located in Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam. 1. Rajarajavinnagar <br />Uyyakkondadevar temple--Visnu temple. 2. Tirumaliruncolai Visnukkal--<br />Visnu temple. 3. Tiruvaypadi devar--Visnu temple. 4. Karunakara-<br />priyadeva temple. 5. Tiru ambalam udaiya Mahadeva temple--Siva <br />temple. <br />The lands (probably cultivable lands) belonging to these temples <br />were situated in the region. Areas included (295-301) The record <br />then proceeds to give the various types of lands that would fall <br />within these four boundaries. 1. Wet land (Nir nilan) 2. Dry land <br />(Puncey) 3. Village (Ur) 4. The residential area (Urirukkai) 5. <br />Temple (Srikoyil) 6. Temple yard (Tirumurram) 7. House (Manai) 8. <br />House-yard (Manaippadappai) 9. Shop (Kadai) 10.

Fallow (Ten payil podumbu) <br />All lands included within the boundaries, without exception, <br />inclusive of cultivation and supervisory rights (service tenure and <br />yield share) excess and shortage all inclusive were made as devatana <br />to Lord Mahadeva of Tiruramisvaram at Rajaraja- caturvedi- mangalam <br />(301-306). <br />Vyavastha (307-320) The following are the permission and <br />restrictions stipulated as Vyavastha. <br />1.Permission is granted to dig canals to irrigate or bale out the <br />lands with the water in accordance with its course. <br />2. Permission is granted to utilise irrigation water by its flow or <br />balling out as enjoyed earlier, from branches, streams, sluices, <br />canals and rivers flowing to this village through the bordering <br />villages. <br />3. Outsiders are prohibited from either cutting branch canals from <br />the irrigation canals of this village, or using picottas or baskets <br />to bale water, or construct dam. <br />4. Use of drinking waters for other common purposes is forbidden. <br />5. Other waters could be canalised to irrigated lands. 6. Permission <br />is granted to raise embankments in their lands to allow this village <br />tank to contain as much water as it could hold. <br />7. Permission is granted to erect residential buildings with storeys <br />using tiles. <br />8. Permission is granted to dig large irrigation wells. <br />9.

Permission is granted to set up oil press. <br />11. Toddy tappers are forbidden to climb and tap toddy from coconut <br />trees within the boundaries of this village. <br />Taxes exempted (321-326) The record then details the exemptions <br />granted which are as follows: <br />1. Nadatci 2. Uratci 3. Vattinali 4. Pidanali 5. Vannarap-parai 6. <br />Kannalak-kanam. 7. Idaip-pattam 8. Kucak-kanam. 9. Tari-irai 10. <br />Tattar-pattam 11. Tattalip-pattam 12. Ilap-putci 13.

Odak-kuli <br />All these taxes which are to be enjoyed by the king, will not be <br />levied by the king, but should be paid to this Lord Mahadeva. <br />Gift deed issued (330-335) 'We the members of the territorial <br />assembly of Ppanaiyur-nadu, issued this "gift deed", after <br />demarcating the boundaries of Nan-nadu and Erpakkam as Vikrama-chola-<br />nallur, from the 15th regnal year of the king, as a deva-tana of <br />Lord Mahadeva of Tiru Ramisvaram, the stone temple in Eydar, a <br />hamlet of Rajaraja- caturvedi-mangalam built by Sarvasiva Pandita'. <br />Signatories (336-348) The deed then mentions the signatories to the <br />grant, giving details of the name of the person, his official <br />position etc. The officers who performed certain functions alone are <br />mentioned here for convenience. Along with the members of <br />territorial assembly was present Krshnan Pattan, who got the gift <br />deed executed (ara olai ceyvittan). He is mentioned as "Tirumuga <br />araycci" stationed at Kanchipuram. Arangan Paniccai supervised the <br />circumambulation by elephant for demarcating the boundaries. He is <br />also mentioned as "Puravu-vari-tinaikkalam". The gift deed was got <br />written by Puran of Uduppur (olai ceydu kudutten). He is also <br />called "Tandal", i.e., the tax collecting officer for Rajaraja-<br />caturvedi-mangalam. It may be mentioned that these three officers <br />were earlier ordered to excute the gift deeds. Here we understand <br />their specific functions-each in charge of one function. <br />We then find the names of four persons who sign as witnesses. All of <br />them belonged to Kunjaramalla- caturvedi-mangalam. The scribe-<br />karanattan, who wrote the 'gift-deed' is mentioned as Nangur Perum-<br />kavidi, the karanattan, of Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam, and wrote <br />this under instructions from the territorial assembly of Panaiyur-<br />nadu. <br />The two caturvedimangalam-s (349-379) Then we find the assembly of <br />Rajaraja- caturvedi- mangalam and Jananatha-caturvedi-mangalam <br />attesting the record. <br />The assemblies were represented by one representative for each ceri <br />and there were eleven ceri-s under each caturvedimangalam. The <br />following ceri-s from Rajaraja- caturvedi-mangalam are mentioned. <br />1. Madurantakac ceri 2. Lokamahadevi ceri 3. Periya vanavan madevic <br />ceri 4. Uttamacholac ceri 5. Rajarajac ceri 6. Colakulasundaric ceri <br />7. Vanavan madevic ceri 8. Arumolidevac ceri 9. Pancavanmadevic ceri <br />10. Cerakulaculamanic ceri 11. Sundaracolac ceri <br />The following ceri-s constituted the Jananatha- caturvedi- mangalam. <br />1. Uttama cholac ceri 2. Rajasundaric ceri 3. Gangaikondacholac ceri <br />4. Rajarajac ceri 5. Jananathac ceri 6. Vikrama-cholac ceri 7. Chola-<br />keralac ceri 8. Chola-Pandyac ceri 9. Madurantakac ceri 10. Mudi-<br />kondacolac ceri 11. Rajendra-cholac ceri It is evident from the <br />above that both the caturvedimangalam had eleven ceri each named <br />after the kings and queens. The names Rajaraja- caturvedi-mangalam <br />and Jananatha- caturvedi- mangalam indicate both were constituted <br />after the name of Rajaraja Cola. A careful study of the names of the <br />ceri indicate that Rajaraja-caturvedi-mangalam was constituted <br />earlier, probably by Rajaraja bearing the names of Rajaraja, his <br />father, mother, queens, predecessor etc. Rajendra's name is not <br />found. Whereas the Jananatha-caturvedi-mangalam, though named after <br />one of the title of Rajaraja, bears mostly the names of Rajendra <br />like Rajendra, Gangaikonda, Vikramacola, Uttamachola etc. Except two <br />names Rajaraja and Jananatha, all the rest belong to Rajendra's <br />reign. Probably it was constituted by Rajendra, who named is after <br />his father. <br />The charter is then attested by the assembly of Tiruvamattur <br />represented by three members among whom one is mentioned as a <br />vellala (380-424). After them the deed is attested by three <br />merchants of Arumolidevapuram. Arumolidevapuram was situated in this <br />Panaiyur-nadu obviously established by Rajaraja as a commercial <br />centre. Three vellala representatives of Kondanji village, a <br />devatana in Vavalurnadu, in Panaiyurnadu attest after the merchants. <br />This part of the deed is followed by nearly 20 government officials <br />who were said to have been present and got the "gift deed" entered <br />in the tax-register and made it a paradatti in the 375th day of the <br />25th year of the king (416). The names of the officers who signed <br />are listed separateloy. We have seen the order was issued by the <br />king on the 10th day of the 24th yerar, and the final orders at the <br />village was completed exactly two years later. It may be noted that <br />apart from the government officials, the signatories included, the <br />assemblies of brahmadeya, (the two Caturvedimangalam) the ur (by <br />Tiruvamattur), the nagaram (by the vyapari of Arumolidevapuram) and <br />devatana (by Kondanji) who were addressed at the very beginning of <br />the order. While the order gives repeatedly the names, nativity, <br />posts etc. of all the signatories it does not mention any name of <br />the nattar. It is strange and therefore the question arises who were <br />the nattars. Is it possible that the nattar meant collectively the <br />assemblies of brahmadeya, ur, Nagaram, and devatana? <br />The grant is an excellent example of how the cola administration was <br />thoroughly organised and the records were meticulously drafted, <br />compared at every stage, and got the participation of the <br />territorial representative fully involved in the process. The <br />charter also gives us the detailed process of how the inscriptions <br />were issued at different stages. It is also tempting to suggest that <br />several hundred inscriptions engraved on the temple walls, relating <br />to devatana, iraiyili etc. in fact constitute only the last araiolai <br />part, that was drafted at the village level, beginning with the <br />prasasti part. <br />Officials <br />The following are the list of officials who supervised and got the <br />deed executed. The first is the list of officials at the king's <br />court in the capital and the second is the list of officers who got <br />the Aravolai at the village. In both the instances, it was Narakkan <br />Marayan Jananathan alias Rajendrachola Brahmamarayan, who was the <br />highest official who ordered and supervised the execution. He is the <br />officer mentioned in the Sanskrit portion as ajnapti. Both the list <br />give the designation of the posts and the names of the incumbants. <br />In both the lists, the posts are more or less identical, but the <br />officers occupying the posts are different except four who were <br />deputed to the village and whose names are found in both the lists. <br />In both the lists two levels of posts, the high and the low are <br />discernable. All the high officials, listed high up in the lists are <br />seen with royal titles--like Muvendavelan, Brahmadhirayan etc., <br />while others have no such titles. <br />LIST I Officials at the capital 1.

Parantakan <br />It seems that Olai and Olainayakam at the capital were responsible <br />for drafting, writing and supervising all orders issued by the king. <br />The Puravuvari Tinaikkalam is the department of revenue <br />administration. This charter gives another department stationed at <br />larger territorial divisions responsible for checking up all orders <br />of the king coming from the capital, reaching the regions. Its name <br />is given Tirumuga Araycci. One such post was sanctioned at Kanchi. <br />Further details regarding the administrative machinery under the <br />Colas will be discussed by us elsewhere.</div>

One of the important<br />event in the history of the Chola-s, that has attracted lively<br />debate, is the term "Virapandyan talai konda". In a fierc battle at<br />Cevvur, the Pandya ruler Vira Pandya and Aditya Karikala, fought a<br />bloody battle. Aditya is given the title "Virapandyan Talai KondaI".<br />Commenging on this Prof. K.A.N. Sastri, says "The Thiruvalangadu<br />plates make an express declaration that Aditya II killed Vira Pandya<br />and brought his severed head to the Chola capital. Even here the<br />lateness of the testimony throws suspicion on the event" (P. 144)<br />Continuing his comments Prof. Sastri says--"Aditya's heroism was<br />probably exhibited in the field of Cevvur to the south of Sevali<br />hills, the Southern boundary of Pudukkottai and the battle must have<br />furnished the occasion for his claim that he took the head of Vira<br />Pandya. The Leyden grant does not state, like the Tiruvalangadu<br />plates, that Virapandya was killed by Aditya and it is possible that<br />the composer of the Thiruvalangadu plates struck by the forcible<br />simile, in the Leyden grant, embellished the account of Aditya's<br />Contest, with Vira Pandya and his account of Aditya's rule adds<br />nothing else to what we learn from the earlier grant. The chances<br />are that after the battle of Cevvur in which Vira Pandya sustained a<br />bad defeat the chola forces, lead among others by Parantaka Siriya<br />velar of Kodumbalur, continued the campaign into the Pandya country<br />and forced Vira Pandya to seek refuge in the forests" (p. 154)<br />Sastri doubted the killing of Vira Pandya and held that the<br />term "Pandyan Talai Konda" should be taken not as killing Pandya,<br />but defeating him in the battle. The present Esalam grant puts an<br />end to this debate by stating that Aditya not only killed Vira<br />Pandya in the battle, but also brought his severed head to Tanjore<br />and had it exhibited spiked onto a pillar in front of the gate. He<br />protected the world as a boy.</div>
