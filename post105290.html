			<div class="content">Venkatesh, I stand corrected on Tyaga Bhoomi<br />timelines, thank you and also for the most interesting<br />post on RKN and Kalki.<br /><br />RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have seen him<br />couple of times and know the family. I had no idea<br />Kalki wrote foreword for his stories, that was really<br />very interesting. RKN, by the way was not pure bred<br />tamilian, he was part kannadiga, his father was raised<br />in Karnataka and he moved there to Mysore too very<br />early on and retained sentiments and love for<br />Karnataka a lot more than Chennai/TN. He knew to read<br />and write Tamil and in his later years particularly<br />read all of Kamba Ramayana and wrote the English<br />Ramayana based on that. His spoken tamil was what they<br />call 'kamil', kannada mixed tamil.<br /><br />If he ever considered writing in an indian language he<br />would probably have preferred Kannada.<br /><br />By the way, would you mind sending details of the book<br />you got this from and where I can get it.<br /><br />Thanks!!<br /><br />Malathi<br />--- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br /><br /><blockquote class="muncited"><div>Hi Suneeta<br /> <br />  a repost on the two geniuses R.K and kalki<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  kalki and R.K narayan<br /> <br />  on Tue, Apr 10 2007, 10:40 IST<br /> <br /> <br />  hi<br />  Just glanced thro R.K Narayan- the early years by<br />  N.Ram and Susan Ram.<br />  noted that kalki and r.k narayan were in employment<br />  of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym> vasan of<br />  ananda vikadan at the same time.<br /> <br />  his english artices and stories was published in THE<br />  MERRY MAGAZINE<br />  of the same group<br /> <br />  kalki has written the foreword for the translation<br />  of narayans book<br />  swami and friends which was serialised in<br />  anandavikadan in 1939 and<br />  later published. r.k was paid the princely sum of<br />  500 rupes for his<br />  efforts.<br /> <br />  in the foreword kalki confesses his prejudice<br />  against indians who<br />  chose to write in english. he refused to read swami<br />  and friends first<br />  and had to be compelled to do so. its reported that<br />  he remarked "oh<br />  there are no english books no. so indians have to<br />  write and fill that<br />  gap."<br />  but after 10 pages he seems to have been captivated.<br />  he loudly<br />  wondered why such a fine boook had not been written<br />  directly in tamil<br />  especially because the author was tamilian and had<br />  never been to<br />  england.<br />  kalki says the book was great and he needed no<br />  instigation to move<br />  for its publication in ananda vikadan. but was<br />  concerned how its<br />  translation could be effected.<br />  he ended the foreword witht the hope that r.k would<br />  be happy witht<br />  the reception the tamil readers gave and hence forth<br />  write in his<br />  mother toungue.<br /> <br />  but R.K though very happy with kalki&#39;s praise was<br />  not tempted to<br />  follow this piece of advise.<br />  venketesh<br /> <br /> <br />  --- <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">Inponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><!-- e -->, "v.suneeta"<br />  <br />  wrote: <br />   <br />    Reading Kalki&#39;s Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of<br />  R.K.Narayan&#39;s Dark Room<br />    which was written in 1930s.

He had an absolutely amazing<br />  memory for people and places, even if he saw you once<br />  it is very likely he would remember you by name and<br />  any details. Laxman on the other hand was a high<br />  society bombayite even early on and as i know<br />  arrogant, snobbish &#40;I have never met him&#41;.<br />  <br />  The Kamala story is one for a novel, since most people<br />  connected are dead and gone I can talk of it i<br />  suppose, would not otherwise. Laxman was married<br />  initially to Kumaari Kamala, the classical dancer who<br />  appears in several b/w movies - konjum salangai,<br />  baktha raavana etc. The other Kamala was indeed his<br />  niece, rich, spoilt and very good looking. She was<br />  initially married to my father&#39;s distant relative,<br />  both extremely rich families. It is said Rajaji was<br />  among the celebrities who attended that wedding and<br />  seeing the amount of money thrown around, he set the<br />  income tax authorities on Kamala&#39;s father <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />  <br />  Anyway it seemed Kamala had interests in her uncle RKL<br />  even before the wedding and the dalliance continued<br />  after. Her husband used to travel abroad frequently<br />  and in his absence they were a merry pair and the<br />  bombay high society was abuzz with rumors. She got<br />  pregnant and had a boy, and the boy was a strong look<br />  alike of Laxman. So things came to a pass and her<br />  husband had had enough, there was no divorce in those<br />  days for hindu marriages so he converted himself to a<br />  muslim &#39;talaqued&#39; her and moved to US. Kumaari Kamala<br />  separated herself from Laxman till divorce was legal<br />  and then divorced him. The &#39;merry pair&#39; married and<br />  lived happily ever after <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />  <br />  Such is the story of high society marriages many times<br />  but this one makes for interesting reading <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" />&#41;<br />  <br />  Malathi<br />  --- "R.venketesh"  wrote: <br />  <br />    Gosh<br />    <br />    so you are vVIP related malathi.<br />    2 vips and my favourites.<br />    laksman and narayanan<br />    <br />    when rK. narayan was asked if he was related to r.<br />    k. lashman he said <br />    " distantly"<br />    then added<br />    I was the second son and he was the 7th<br />    <br />    the numbers may be wrong when I recall<br />    <br />    malathi could you clear a doubt for me<br />    how was kamala related to lakshman before wedding- I<br />    have heard she <br />    was his niece. is it right??<br />    <br />    venketesh<br />    <br />    @yahoogroups.com, Malathi Mahadevan <br />    wrote: <br />     <br />      Venkatesh, I stand corrected on Tyaga Bhoomi<br />      timelines, thank you and also for the most<br />    interesting<br />      post on RKN and Kalki.<br />      <br />      RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have seen<br />    him<br />      couple of times and know the family.
