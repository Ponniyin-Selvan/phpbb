			<div class="content">The last plantation I worked in Malaysia before migrating to <br />Australia was situated near the town of Sitiawan in Western <br />(Peninsula) Malaysia. One of my first duties in that plantation was <br />to familiarise myself with the plantation boundary. This was of <br />crucial importance as it prevented neighboring plantations and <br />smallholders from encroaching into our plantation. In my stay in the <br />plantation, I patrolled the boundary at least one a month to prevent <br />the above from occurring. In my very first boundary patrol however, <br />I was shocked to notice a strange rock formation at the back of the <br />plantation.<br /><br />This formation presented itself suddenly to me as I drove along the <br />winding dirt road at the back of the plantation. The whole rocky <br />feature just sort of jumped out of nowhere as I negotiated a tight <br />corner in the road. The first time I saw it, I was completely <br />spellbound. There in front of me were rocky outcrops, about thirty <br />meters high in an array of fascinating shapes. It appeared as if a <br />giant had gone to work a mighty chisel and hammer and carved out all <br />these fantastic shapes. The rocks in this area were all reddish <br />brown in color except for the first rock as we enter the area, which <br />was off white. The locals in the area called this first rock, "lady <br />with a baby". Looking at this rock one would swear that it was <br />chiselled into shape by humans and not shaped by natural forces, as <br />it bore striking resemblance to a lady nursing a baby. It was about <br />thirty meters high and was surrounded by wild shrubs. The other <br />rocks in the area too were no less strange. There was a rock outcrop <br />that looked exactly like a human face. There was a distinct nose, <br />mouth and chin, and wild oil palm trees grew on top of this <br />formation giving it a surreal effect of the head having hair on top. <br />More will be mentioned about this face like structure later. The <br />rest of the rocks appeared to have faces of the Hindu pantheon. Thus <br />one could make out the form of the Hindu god Ganesh, who has an <br />elephant head, the form of Vishnu and that of the goddess <br />Saraswathy, complete with her vina (musical instrument).<br /><br />After about six months in the plantation, I made discreet inquires <br />from the locals about the history of this place, and why all the <br />rocks in it looked as if they were carved out by human hands. This <br />is the grand story they told me regarding this place.<br /><br />Close to and north-east of Sitiawan lies the small town of Bruas <br />(Beruas). During earier times, this was the seat of the Hindu <br />kingdom of Ganga Negarra in Malaysia( then called Malaya ). The <br />rulers of this kingdom were from south India and most likely from <br />the early Chola dynasty. It was a prosperous kingdom, and managed to <br />bring several of the neighboring districts under its control. It <br />grew in strength as the years went by, and its successive rulers <br />attempted to break away from the main Chola empire in South India. <br />To bring this renegade kingdom back into the folds of the Chola <br />empire, the then emperor of the Chola kingdom, Rajaraja Cholan II <br />despatched an army to Malaysia to teach the ruler of Ganga Negarra a <br />lesson he would not forget. The ruler of Gangga Negarra got wind of <br />this impending attack from merchants, and prepared to defend his <br />kingdom.<br /><br />Now close to where my plantation was is a large tract of sandy area. <br />This is sand from the nearby river called Sungei Perak. Throughout <br />history, this river had changed course several times, and each time <br />it did, it left a sandy area behind. My bungalow was situated on <br />this sandy tract. The sand was several meters deep and allowed only <br />certain types of grasses and Tembusu trees to grow on it. The ruler <br />of Ganga Negarra thought he would engage the forces of the Chola <br />empire on this sandy tract. The Sungei Perak was much larger then, <br />and the warships from India would have planned to use it to get as <br />close as possible to the town of Bruas. The ruler of Ganga Negarra <br />therefore planned to surprise the Chola forces by engaging them as <br />soon as they left the open seas and entered the Sungei Perak. He <br />probably planned an ambush at this area.<br /><br />The battle that ensured took place on this sandy tract. The Chola <br />forces were better armed than that of Ganga Neggara. Besides having <br />cannons, the Chola force was battle hardened- having continually <br />fought battles in India. The end result was a riot. The Chola forces <br />practically mowed down the forces of Ganga Negarra. The ruler of <br />Ganga Negarra fled. He had brought his wife and his infant with him, <br />and now they ran for their lives. The baby was only a few months old <br />and the wife clutched it to her bosom as they fled through the <br />trees. The Chola general sent a platoon after the Ganga Neggara <br />king, but the latter being familiar with the area, managed to <br />outdistance himself from them. As they ran deeper into the forest, <br />the baby for one reason or another, was abandoned, and left to die. <br />The king and his wife finally reached the rocky outcrop mentioned <br />above and decided to hide out there. The wife however soon died from <br />a broken heart, pining night and day for her lost child. The king of <br />Ganga Negarra was therefore left alone in this rocky outcrop.<br /><br />What was not known to the populace of Ganga Negarra however was that <br />A History and a Mystery Carved in Stone. Not only could he meditate <br />for long hours, he had also mastered several yogic powers. With the <br />loss of his wife, the king decided to plunge even deeper into his <br />spiritual practices. Using mind power alone, he started carving the <br />rocks to leave a memento of the tragic events that befell his life. <br />The rock that represented a lady nursing a child was supposed to <br />represent his wife and baby. The rock outcrop that represented a <br />face was to represent himself facing in the direction of his beloved <br />kingdom in Bruas. Being a Hindu, he had carved the other rocks to <br />represent the many gods and goddesses of that religion.</div>

One of my first duties in that plantation <br />was <br />  to familiarise myself with the plantation boundary. This was of <br />  crucial importance as it prevented neighboring plantations and <br />  smallholders from encroaching into our plantation. In my stay in <br />the <br />  plantation, I patrolled the boundary at least one a month to <br />prevent <br />  the above from occurring. In my very first boundary patrol <br />however, <br />  I was shocked to notice a strange rock formation at the back of <br />the <br />  plantation.<br />  <br />  This formation presented itself suddenly to me as I drove along <br />the <br />  winding dirt road at the back of the plantation. The whole rocky <br />  feature just sort of jumped out of nowhere as I negotiated a tight <br />  corner in the road. The first time I saw it, I was completely <br />  spellbound. There in front of me were rocky outcrops, about thirty <br />  meters high in an array of fascinating shapes. It appeared as if a <br />  giant had gone to work a mighty chisel and hammer and carved out <br />all <br />  these fantastic shapes. The rocks in this area were all reddish <br />  brown in color except for the first rock as we enter the area, <br />which <br />  was off white. The locals in the area called this first <br />rock, "lady <br />  with a baby". Looking at this rock one would swear that it was <br />  chiselled into shape by humans and not shaped by natural forces, <br />as <br />  it bore striking resemblance to a lady nursing a baby. It was <br />about <br />  thirty meters high and was surrounded by wild shrubs. The other <br />  rocks in the area too were no less strange. There was a rock <br />outcrop <br />  that looked exactly like a human face. There was a distinct nose, <br />  mouth and chin, and wild oil palm trees grew on top of this <br />  formation giving it a surreal effect of the head having hair on <br />top. <br />  More will be mentioned about this face like structure later. The <br />  rest of the rocks appeared to have faces of the Hindu pantheon. <br />Thus <br />  one could make out the form of the Hindu god Ganesh, who has an <br />  elephant head, the form of Vishnu and that of the goddess <br />  Saraswathy, complete with her vina &#40;musical instrument&#41;.<br />  <br />  After about six months in the plantation, I made discreet inquires <br />  from the locals about the history of this place, and why all the <br />  rocks in it looked as if they were carved out by human hands. This <br />  is the grand story they told me regarding this place.<br />  <br />  Close to and north-east of Sitiawan lies the small town of Bruas <br />  &#40;Beruas&#41;. During earier times, this was the seat of the Hindu <br />  kingdom of Ganga Negarra in Malaysia&#40; then called Malaya &#41;. The <br />  rulers of this kingdom were from south India and most likely from <br />  the early Chola dynasty. It was a prosperous kingdom, and managed <br />to <br />  bring several of the neighboring districts under its control. It <br />  grew in strength as the years went by, and its successive rulers <br />  attempted to break away from the main Chola empire in South India. <br />  To bring this renegade kingdom back into the folds of the Chola <br />  empire, the then emperor of the Chola kingdom, Rajaraja Cholan II <br />  despatched an army to Malaysia to teach the ruler of Ganga Negarra <br />a <br />  lesson he would not forget. The ruler of Gangga Negarra got wind <br />of <br />  this impending attack from merchants, and prepared to defend his <br />  kingdom.<br />  <br />  Now close to where my plantation was is a large tract of sandy <br />area. <br />  This is sand from the nearby river called Sungei Perak. Throughout <br />  history, this river had changed course several times, and each <br />time <br />  it did, it left a sandy area behind. My bungalow was situated on <br />  this sandy tract. The sand was several meters deep and allowed <br />only <br />  certain types of grasses and Tembusu trees to grow on it. The <br />ruler <br />  of Ganga Negarra thought he would engage the forces of the Chola <br />  empire on this sandy tract. The Sungei Perak was much larger then, <br />  and the warships from India would have planned to use it to get as <br />  close as possible to the town of Bruas. The ruler of Ganga Negarra <br />  therefore planned to surprise the Chola forces by engaging them as <br />  soon as they left the open seas and entered the Sungei Perak. He <br />  probably planned an ambush at this area.<br />  <br />  The battle that ensured took place on this sandy tract. The Chola <br />  forces were better armed than that of Ganga Neggara. Besides <br />having <br />  cannons, the Chola force was battle hardened- having continually <br />  fought battles in India. The end result was a riot. The Chola <br />forces <br />  practically mowed down the forces of Ganga Negarra. The ruler of <br />  Ganga Negarra fled. He had brought his wife and his infant with <br />him, <br />  and now they ran for their lives. The baby was only a few months <br />old <br />  and the wife clutched it to her bosom as they fled through the <br />  trees. The Chola general sent a platoon after the Ganga Neggara <br />  king, but the latter being familiar with the area, managed to <br />  outdistance himself from them. As they ran deeper into the forest, <br />  the baby for one reason or another, was abandoned, and left to <br />die. <br />  The king and his wife finally reached the rocky outcrop mentioned <br />  above and decided to hide out there. The wife however soon died <br />from <br />  a broken heart, pining night and day for her lost child. The king <br />of <br />  Ganga Negarra was therefore left alone in this rocky outcrop.<br />  <br />  What was not known to the populace of Ganga Negarra however was <br />that <br />  A History and a Mystery Carved in Stone. Not only could he <br />meditate <br />  for long hours, he had also mastered several yogic powers. With <br />the <br />  loss of his wife, the king decided to plunge even deeper into his <br />  spiritual practices. Using mind power alone, he started carving <br />the <br />  rocks to leave a memento of the tragic events that befell his <br />life. <br />  The rock that represented a lady nursing a child was supposed to <br />  represent his wife and baby. The rock outcrop that represented a <br />  face was to represent himself facing in the direction of his <br />beloved <br />  kingdom in Bruas. Being a Hindu, he had carved the other rocks to <br />  represent the many gods and goddesses of that religion.</div></blockquote></div>
